          1.2 On the basis of your understanding of the above passage, answer the following questions: [1 × 7 = 7]
          <br/>
          (f) What did Jane Austen like?
          <br/>
          (g) Why do you think Graham Green hired a secret office?
          <br/>
          (h) What was the rumour about Erik Satie’s productivity?
          <br/>
          (i) How did her limited social life affect Simone de Beauvoir?
          <br/>
          (j) In what way did T.S. Eliot’s day job help him to write?
          <br/>
          (k) What makes it easier for one to stay on the path?
          <br/>
          (l) Which word in the passage (para 1) means the same as glance / look?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (f) Jane Austen liked a private workplace. She did not want a certain squeaky hinge to be oiled so that it warned her whenever someone was approaching the room where she wrote.
          <br/>
          (g) Graham Green hired a secret office because he needed a workplace where he could work on his creation uninterruptedly.
          <br/>
          (h) Erik Satie used to stop under street lamps on his long hikes from Paris to the place where he lived in the working-class suburb, and jot down ideas that came to his mind during the walk. It is rumoured that when those street lights were turned off during the war years, his music too declined.
          <br/>
          (i) Simone de Beauvoir led a limited social life. There were no receptions or parties. It was an uncluttered kind of life, a deliberately constructed simplicity so that she could concentrate on her work.
          <br/>
          (j) T.S. Eliot found it much easier to write once he had a day job in a bank than he could as a starving poet.
          <br/>
          (k) Following a routine and leading an organized life may be irritating but it makes it easier for one to stay on the path.
          <br/>
          (l) The word ‘peep’ means the same as glace/look.
         </p>
         <p>
          Question 2.
          <br/>
          Read the passage below: [8]
          <br/>
          The Great Wall of China was built to link existing fortifications into a united defense system and better keep invading Mongol tribes out of China. It is the largest man-made monument ever to have been built and it is said that it is the only one visible from space. Many thousands of people must have given their lives to build this huge construction. The Great Wall of China is a series of towers made of stone, brick, earth, wood and other materials, generally built along an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of the various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were being built as early as the 7th century BCE; these, later joined together and made bigger and stronger, are now collectively referred to as the Great Wall. Especially famous is the wall built (220-206 BCE) by Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China. Little of that wall remains. Since then, the Great Wall has on and off been rebuilt,
         </p>
         <p>
          maintained and enhanced; the majority of the existing wall is from the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).
          <br/>
          Other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and emigration. Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of watch towers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor.
         </p>
         <p>
          True
         </p>
         <p>
          Intending to impose centralized rule and prevent the resurgence of feudal lords, he ordered the destruction of some sections of the walls, however, he ordered building of new walls to connect the remaining fortifications along the empire’s northern frontier. Transporting the large quantity of materials required for construction was difficult, so builders always tried to use local resources. Stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges, while earth was used for construction in the plains.
          <br/>
          The Great Wall concept was revived under the Ming dynasty in the 14th century, to gain a clear upper hand over the Mongolian tribes.

          Hardwork, not Intelligence paves the way to success in life. (150-200 words)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          “Hardwork beats intelligence when intelligence does not work hard”. This saying is replete with fact. The idea is not to undermine the importance of intelligence but to emphasize that there is no substitute for hard work. Good Morning everyone! 1 …., have come before you all in favour of the motion: ‘Hard work, not Intelligence paves the way to success in life’.
          <br/>
          Though it cannot be denied that an intelligent person possesses a natural ability to do something well, but intelligence alone does not ascertain success, unless it is accompanied by hard work. The ability of an intelligent person has to be combined with hard work. Hard work embellishes one’s personality, polishes one’s talents and unlocks a person’s potentials so as to pave the way to achieve success in life.
         </p>
         <p>
          Working hard is so important that it can, to a great extent, compensate for lack of intelligence but there is no alternative to hard work. Strong determination, confidence and a desire to reach your goals should always be . cherished but this aspiration can only be fulfilled by working laboriously. Many a time intelligent people do not work hard enough, they become contented and feel complacent in their own sense of superiority. They overlook the fact that it is only hard work that enables us to utilise our knowledge and intelligence in the most conducive way. Hard work brings in perseverance and resoluteness that enables you to set targets and guides you like a teacher so that you do not derail from your track.
          <br/>
          I would like to conclude by saying not all of us can be intelligent, but we all can achieve a lot by putting in that extra effort which will surely pave the way for success in life. Thank you

          You are RarryTRajani. Write a speech in 150-200 words on ‘Importance of Morning Walk’.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The only thing one may at times not like about a morning walk is the fact that one has to get up early in the morning from a sound sleep. Other than that, the importance and advantages of morning walk are manifold. Good Morning everyone! I, Rajani, have come before you all to speak on the topic, ‘Importance of Morning Walk’.
          <br/>
          The morning atmosphere is fresh and pleasant, there is less pollution in the air and the lovely sights and sounds of nature soothes one’s mind and body. Regular morning walk keeps one fit. It helps control blood pressure, lessens stress and gives us the energy to work with zeal. It is a light exercise that is suitable for people of all ages. Young men and women, old people as well as children, all can benefit from a morning walk which soothes our entire being.
         </p>
         <p>
          A brisk walk in the morning activates our body’s systems, normalises our pulse rate and improves our blood circulation. When we begin our day with a walk, we rid ourselves from lethargy and experience a high level of energy that has a positive effect on our physical and mental well-being. Morning walk actually creates a positive momentum that stays with us throughout the day. The best thing about a morning walk is that it is a simple workout regime that most people think they can stick to life long.
          <br/>
          To conclude, I would like to say that since we all share the need to stay healthy, walking is a great way to spend quality time in the company of family and friends doing something that is beneficial to everyone.

          Question 6.
          <br/>
          Choice of course after clearing Senior School Examination produces a great deal of stress on the minds of our students. Counselling can be of great help to them. Write an article in 150-200 words on the topic, ‘Role of counselling in choice of course’. You are Ram/Rajani. [10]

          <br/>
          ROLE OF COUNSELLING IN CHOICE OF COURSE
          <br/>
          By: Ram
          <br/>
          Every student faces the question of ‘What Next?’ after clearing his Senior School Examination. During this phase most students face a great deal of stress and at this time counselling regarding the choice of course can prove to be of valuable help to them. Many students face a dilemma while choosing a course because the only career guidance they have is the opinion of their parents, the teacher’s judgement and their friends’ comments. These factors are certainly not sufficient for a child to base the foundation of his entire life and career. Professional counselling involves scientifically developed aptitude and personality tests that enable the counsellor to give the best suited advice to students to choose the course that best suits their ability.
         </p>
         <p>
          Human capabilities are numerous and cannot be measured but every person has some unique traits. Based on their strengths, one of the keys that helps to identify these qualities is through the medium of counselling. Counselling sessions help the students to understand the pros and cons of the different streams and the career paths they offer, so students can make an informed choice and get a correct course assessment that enables them to avoid risk of career path change later in their life.
          <br/>
          Counselling thus provides the essential morale-boost to students by building their level of motivation that is very essential for long-term success and improves their overall performance.

          THE GRANDEUR OF REPUBLIC DAY CELEBRATIONS

          <br/>
          Shyamala Public School, Salem
          <br/>
          Being an N.C.C cadet I got the privilege of attending the Republic Day Parade in Delhi. I was awe-struck by its sheer grandeur and magnificence. The parade showcases not only India’s defence capability but also gives us a unique glimpse of our cultural and social heritage. The Republic Day Parade which is held in the capital city, New Delhi starts from the Rashtrapati Bhavan, along Rajpath, past India Gate. Before its commencement, the Prime Minister lays a floral wreath at the ‘Amar Jawan Jyoti, a memorial to the soldiers who laid down their lives during various wars. The President then unfurls the National flag after which the different regiments of our armed forces march past with their bands in all their fineries saluting their commander-in-chief, the President of India.

          Leadership is all about a strong concern for others. What light does Champaran episode throw on Gandhiji’s leadership?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          There is no doubt about the fact that a good leader is one who has a strong concern for others:. Not only does he have a mass appeal but he even rises from the masses. He is a man of principles and his life is an open book. Gandhiji’s sincere efforts to get justice for the Champaran sharecroppers and his conscientious endeavours to uplift the people there are proof enough of the true leadership qualities that he possessed. His primary concern was the welfare of the common man because Gandhiji never contented himself with large political or economic solutions. Seeing the cultural and social backwardness in the Champaran village he wanted to do something about it immediately. His politics was always intertwined with the practical day-to-day problems of the millions and through his selfless actions he displayed what true leadership was all about.

          <br/>
          The good people we meet sometimes leave an impression on us. Compassion and understanding can transform a person and bring out his essential human goodness. As is the case with the rattrap peddler whose meeting with the crofter and Edla bring about a positive transformation in his nature. The lonely old crofter was extremely kind to the peddler. Despite his hospitality the peddler stole his money and committed a breach of trust. Edla too treated him nicely, even after she came to know his true identity. The peddler who had always considered the world to be a rattrap that enclosed upon people finally felt released from this rattrap due to the kind, generous and sympathetic treatment of the crofter and Edla. He leaves behind a letter of thanks for Edla with a Christmas gift and the money he had stolen from the crofter, to be restored to its rightful owner.

          Attempt a character sketch of the Governor in the story, ‘Evans Tries an O-LeveT. What was the only flaw in his handling of Evans?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The Governor of HM Prison, Oxford, despite being an extra cautious man, is actually quite gullible and he, quite unfortunately, over-estimates himself. His judgement of people is rather poor. Due to his average intelligence he is not able to comprehend and understand Evan’s shrewdness. He ignores vital matters that require his personal attention. Searching McLeery and escorting the wounded McLeery needed his personal supervision but he neglected these. He became rather casual at the critical times and fails to grasp the complexity of the situation. However, he does reveal a mark of intelligence when he locates the hotel where Evans is hiding on the basis of the correction slip. But then again he ignores the vital issues and finally is unable to capture Evans.
         </p>
         <p>
          The only flaw in his handling of Evans was that the Governor gets a little over-confident when he tells himself that Evans had no chance of escaping. He over-estimates himself and his intelligence and underestimates Evans’ shrewdness and cleverness.

          Ans. An American prisoner of war got washed away to Japanese doctor, Sadao’s doorstep. Being a doctor, Sadao gave top priority to saving the life of a dying man despite the ongoing war between America and Japan and the fact that all Americans were considered to be their enemies. Being a doctor, Sadao’s duty was to save a dying man but saving an enemy would be an act of treachery. But the doctor not only saved him from dying but did not even hand him over to the police. He rose above narrow prejudices of race and country and helped the young soldier to escape. Dr. Sadao’s basic human values gave him the ability to rise above petty prejudices. His essential love for humanity and his sincerity towards his duty transcend all other narrow considerations. As a doctor it was his duty to save a dying man so he put aside all other options and respected the ethics of his profession.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Which is a better course to opt for after the Xth standard? A decade or so earlier 1 would have answered this question saying Science stream was the best option but now I would say that if one has a better aptitude for Humanities, then he should go for it without thinking. Good Morning everyone! I have come before you all to speak in favour of the motion: ‘Courses in Humanities provide a better scope in career than Sciences’.
          <br/>
          In the present scenario, with the advent of globalization the scope for humanities has altered. Fast growing markets, mushrooming media houses and a plethora of career options that could be both academic or vocational, has brought the humanities stream, which was once considered as a secondary discipline to the front. The rising professions of marketing, media, entertainment and administration have opened avenues for students of this discipline. … ’
         </p>
         <p>
          The demand created by market economy has raised the prominence of subjects like economics, literature, fine arts, law, communication, english etc. The under graduate and post graduate programmes in humanities are neither narrow in scope nor limited in opportunities. Rather they now offer a wide and expensive scope for research and higher studies in a range of subjects. The dogmas in our society regarding students opting for the humanities stream is now a thing of the past.
          <br/>
          To conclude, I would like to say that now professionals from this field are commanding great respect and receiving high salaries in the job market, and competing with their science and technology counterparts on the entrepreneurship front.

         </p>
         <p>
          When we laugh, a positivity brightens us and we are able to spread this positive feeling to others. Just by having a good laugh we can relax both our body and our mind. Even in the most difficult of times a laugh or even a smile can make you feel better as it disintegrates feelings that make one upset. It helps one to unwind and energize himself. You can get rid of the tensions and stress that clutter your mind with a good laugh that infuses fresh energy and enthusiasm.
          <br/>
          As Charles Dickens said, “There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humour.” But unfortunately in today’s busy and hectic life people have forgotten hotv to laugh and enjoy small jokes.
          <br/>
          This could be one of the major reasons why there is an unprecedented rise in the number of people who suffer from depression. Charlie Chaplin very rightly said, “A day without laughter is a day wasted”.

          I would like to conclude by saying, “You don’t stop laughing because you grow older, you grow older because you stop laughing.”

          WOMEN MUST BE GIVEN HONOUR

          By: Ram, Social Activist
          <br/>
          Women constitute almost half of the world’s population and are equal stakeholders of society. But unfortunately, even now, in the 21st century, violence against women is rampant and their unnecessary harassment continues despite the hue and cry of there being more laws to ensure their protection.

          It is a bitter reality that, every year, thousands of women become victims of violence in their homes and are harassed on the roads and sometimes these incidents devastate their lives for ever. These unfortunate incidents affect the physical as well as mental health of the victim. It is very important to take up concrete efforts and introduce stern laws to ensure how violence and harassment against women can be avoided and how they can get their due honour in society.
         </p>
         <p>
          we cannot just hold our legal system and the police responsible for the atrocities committed to women. As good citizens, we have a fundamental duty to contribute towards bringing an order to ensure dignity and respect for women so that they too can live with a sense of freedom, pride and confidence.
         </p>
         <p>
          A reform in the police system is also needed wherein women police should be deployed in most areas so as to make women feel safe. CCTV cameras should be installed at strategic places and these should be closely monitored.
          <br/>
          Our legal system also needs reforms wherein stringent punishments that are non-bailable in nature should be given to a person who outrages the modesty of a woman. We also need fast track courts to deal with offences and crimes against women.
          <br/>
          The need of the hour is to take action not by force but by will to make our country safe and secure for women and bring in reforms whereby women feel more fearless and empowered.

          IMPORTANCE OF NEWSPAPERS IN OUR LIFE
          <br/>
          By: Rajani
          <br/>
          Newspapers are the oldest and most reliable source of news and information. The electronic media is at times unreliable, gives inadequate information and is not always available. Newspapers are not only most easily available but they are also the cheapest. Moreover newspapers are very important for students for a good exposure to English language and enhancement of their vocabulary through the “Editorial Column”. Newspapers are written with honesty and sincerity unlike the electronic media which sensationalizes news to increase TRPs and sometimes misleads public.
         </p>
         <p>
          Falstaff: television news channels tend to omit facts and details about an incident . newspaper comes in handy as it gives not only vital details but also contains more reliable news . newspaper also contains many columns dedicated to advertisements like vacant situations, buying or selling of goods, information about missing persons, obituary news, etc.

          BANNING OF LIQUOR SHOPS
          <br/>
          By: Rajani
          <br/>
          Many states have taken up the welcome move of banning liquor shops. These states include Gujarat, Bihar, Nagaland and Manipur and the Union Territory of Lakshadweep. This move is most positive and will help to promote the physical and mental well-being of society in general.
          <br/>
          Binge drinking and continued alcohol consumption cause many health problems. Moreover, it decreases productivity of an individual, increases family problems and is also one of the major causes of broken relationships. People who drink heavily are most likely to develop a physical and emotional dependency on alcohol. With so many negative effects associated with its consumption there is no reason why one should not appreciate the government’s move of banning liquor shops.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is also a matter of appreciation that the governments are ready to forego the large amount of revenue that they gain by selling liquor, only because it impacts negatively on society. The Government of these states have imposed complete ban for a social cause to create an alcohol free environment. Through this ban the. governments hope to improve the society’s standard of living. When alcohol is not available and there is no way it can be bought the money one wastes on it is saved and can be utilised productively elsewhere. So there is no doubt about the fact that this bold and welcome move taken by the governments should be appreciated and applauded.

          Answer:
          <br/>
          THE PROBLEM OF POLLUTION
          <br/>
          By: Ram/Rajani
          <br/>
          Cities, in general, have a great deal in common with vehicles. In fact they often seem to be turning into vehicles. India’s population and its traffic is concentrated within its cities. The increasing number of vehicles in Delhi is putting our city at the risk of completely losing clean air to breathe. Delhi would have, in fact, been buried under a pollution load if the Supreme Court had not intervened to introduce cleaner fuels and emissions technology in the city, in the form of CNG-run public vehicles. Moreover, increase in the number of vehicles also means getting stuck in rush traffic hour which has also become a routine. It is high time we now look towards solving this problem of heavy traffic congestion which is taking a toll both on our health and our time.
         </p>
         <p>
          True
         </p>
         <p>
          Most of us who have walked along the congested commercial areas of our cities will certainly agree that private cars are indeed a nuisance that further add to the congestion of traffic and create unnecessary chaos.
          <br/>
          Good morning everyone, I …, have come before you all to speak in favour of the motion ‘Private cars should be banned in the congested commercial areas of the cities.’ Private cars can never improve the quality of life in big cities, especially in the congested commercial areas. They are noisy and dangerous to street users. People have to waste their valuable time and fuel in heavy traffic jams. Since we now have plenty of alternatives like highly improvised public transport which include private cabs, buses and the metro train services, it has become rather convenient to commute from one place to another within the city.
         </p>
         <p>
          More cars also means higher levels of pollution in our already polluted cities. Reducing the number of cars on the city, roads can help the government to save a huge amount of petrol. Moreover driving city roads is nothing but relentless misery for car owners and I am sure they too would prefer tension-free and easy options to travel.
          <br/>
          To conclude, I would like to say banning certain things can sometimes help us to lead stress-free lives which will certainly do us good in the long run.
          <br/>
          Thank You!

          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) The usual hustle and bustle of the morning hours could not be seen on the day of the last lesson. It was all very still and quiet as it used to be on a Sunday morning. The din of opening and closing of desks and the rapping of the teacher’s ruler on the table could not be heard. The students had already taken their places and even the village elders had gathered there.
         </p>
         <p>
          (a) As Douglas was sitting on the side of the YMCA pool waiting for others, a boy who was around eighteen years old came there and yelled, ‘Hi, Skinny! How’d you like to be ducked?’ saying this, he tossed Douglas into the deep end of the pool.

         <p>
          f) Derry is a complex-ridden fourteen year old boy . he is a victim of inferiority complex after acid accidentally spilled and burnt one side of his face . his handicap has filled him with bitterness and so Derry suffers more on account of the pain that his own views of how everyone hates him, causes him .
         </p>
         <p>
          : (f) Evan’s German teacher had a very low opinion of his (Evans’) proficiency in German. (g) Evan’s German teacher had a very low opinion of his (Evans’) proficiency in German.
