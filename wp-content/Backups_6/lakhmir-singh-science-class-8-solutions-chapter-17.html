          Question 4.
          <br/>
          Name the unit which is used to express distances between the various celestial bodies (like stars and planets).
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Light year is the unit used to express distance between the various celestial bodies. Light year is the distance travelled by light in one year. The speed of light is 300,000 km per second. For example, the Sun is nearly 150,000,000 Km i.e. 150 million Km away from the Earth. The distance of the Sun from the Earth may be said to be about 8 light minutes.
         </p>
         <p>
          Question 5.
          <br/>
          Why is the distance between stars and planets expressed in light years?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The distance between the Earth and stars and the distance between the stars is very large. The stars are millions of times farther away than the Sun. the Sun is nearly 150,000,000 Km i.e. 150 million Km away from the Earth. It is inconvenient to express these distances in kilometres. Therefore, these large distances are expressed in light years. For example, the distance of the Sun from the Earth may be said to be about 8 light minutes.
         </p>
         <p>
          Question 6.
          <br/>
          What do you understand by the statement that a star is 8 light years away from the Earth?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The distance between the Earth and stars and the distance between the stars is very large. It is inconvenient to express these distances in kilometres. Therefore, these large distances are expressed in light years.
         </p>
         <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
         </div>
         <p>
          1 light year= 9.46 Ã— 10
          <sup>
           12
          </sup>
          Km. Now, a star is 8 light years away from the Earth. It means the distance between the star and the Earth is equal to the distance travelled by light in eight years.
         </p>
         <p>
          Therefore, the star is located 8 Ã— 9.46 Ã— 10
          <sup>
           12
          </sup>
          Km = 75.68 Ã— 10
          <sup>
           12
          </sup>
          Km away from the Earth.
         </p>
         <p>
          Question 7.
          <br/>
          Name the constellation which reminds us of a large ladle or a question mark in the night sky.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Ursa Major is the constellation which reminds us of a large ladle or a question mark in the night sky. It is also known as the Big Dipper, the Great Bear or the Saptarshi. There are seven prominent stars in this constellation. It appears like a big ladle or a question mark. There are three stars in the handle of the ladle and four in its bowl.

          Question 46.
          <br/>
          What is meant by â€˜celestial objectsâ€™? Name any three celestial objects.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The stars, the planets, the moon and many other objects in the sky are called celestial objects. The moon is the brightest object in the night sky. Stars are celestial bodies that emit light of their own. Our sun is also a star. Moon is the natural satellite of the Earth. The Sun and the celestial bodies which revolve around it form the solar system. These celestial bodies include the planets, comets, asteroids and meteors.

          <br/>
          What is a star? Name the star nearest to the Earth.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Stars are celestial bodies that emit light of their own. Our sun is also a star. It is convenient to express distances of stars in light years. Stars appear to move from east to west. The pole star appears to be stationary from the Earth, because it is situated close to the direction of the axis of rotation of the Earth. Some groups of stars appear to form recognizable groups known as constellation. The Sun is the star nearest to the Earth. It is the source of almost all energy on the Earth. The Sun is the main source of heat and light for all the planets.

          Question 48.
          <br/>
          Why does Pole Star appear to be stationary in the sky?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The pole star appears to be stationary from the Earth, because it is situated close to the direction of the axis of rotation of the Earth. The Pole Star is not visible from the southern hemisphere. Some of the northern constellations like Ursa Major may also not be visible from some points in the southern hemisphere.

          Question 49.
          <br/>
          Do all the stars in the sky move? Explain.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The stars appear to move in the sky. It appears because of the motion of the Earth. Earth is spinning around its own axis and also moves around the Sun. As a result, the stars also appear to move from east to west. A star which rises in the east in the evening, sets in the west in the early morning. All the stars do not appear to move. For example, pole star does not appear to move because it is situated in the direction of earthâ€™s axis.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The Sun and the celestial bodies which revolve around it form the Solar System. It consists of large number of bodies such as planets, comets, asteroids and meteors. The Gravitational force keeps the members of the Solar System bound to the Sun. The Sun is the star having a system of planets with one planet called Earth with life on it. Comets are the member of the Solar System which appears in the sky like a bright ball of light with a long glowing tail. Asteroids are the celestial objects which are also called minor planets. Asteroids can only be seen through large telescopes. Meteors are commonly known as shooting stars, although they are not stars.

          <br/>
          What are planets? How many planets are there in the Solar System?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Planets are the members of the Solar System. They look like stars but they do not have light of their own. They reflect the sunlight that fall on them. They keep changing their positions with respect to the stars. A planet revolves around the Sun in a definite path. This path is called an orbit. The time taken by a planet to complete one revolution is called its period of revolution. As the distance of the planet increases from the Sun, the period of revolution increases. A planet also rotates on its axis besides revolving around the Sun. The time taken by the planet to complete one rotation is called its period of rotation. Some planets have moons or satellites revolving around them.

          Question 56.
          <br/>
          Why is it difficult to observe the planet Mercury?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Mercury is the nearest planet to the Sun. It is the smallest planet of our Solar System. It is very close to the Sun which makes it very difficult to observe. This is because most of the time it hidden in the glare of the Sun. However, it can be observed just before sunrise or just after sunset, near the horizon. Mercury has no satellite of its own.

          <br/>
          State one important consequence of each of the following:
          <br/>
          (a) Rotation of Earth on its axis.
          <br/>
          (b) Motion of tilted Earth around the Sun.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) The Earth rotates on its axis taking approximately 24 hours to complete one rotation. Rotation of Earth causes the day night cycle which also creates a corresponding cycle of temperature and humidity.
         </p>
         <p>
          (b) The plane in which the Earth revolves round the Sun is called the orbital plane of the Earth. The axis of rotation of the Earth is not perpendicular to the plane of its orbit. These two planes are inclined to each other at an angle of 23.5Â° This tilt is responsible for the change of seasons on the Earth.

          Comets are the member of the Solar System which appears in the sky like a bright ball of light with a long glowing tail. The length of the tail grows in size as it approaches the sun. The tail of a comet is always directed away from the sun. They revolve around the Sun in highly elliptical orbits. The period of revolution of comets around the Sun is usually very long. Many comets are known to appear periodically. Halleyâ€™s comet appears after nearly every 76 years. It was last seen in 1986.

          What is the difference between a full Moon and a new Moon? After how many days a full Moon changes into a new Moon?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          There is a change in the shape of moon every day. There are days when the shape of moon appears perfectly round. Also, there are days when the moon cannot be seen at all even if the sky is clear. The day on which the whole disc of the moon is visible is called the full Moon day. Every night, the size of the bright part of the moon appears to become thinner and thinner. On the fifteenth day, the moon is not visible. This day is called the new Moon day. The next day, only a small portion of the moon appears in the sky. This is known as the crescent moon. Then again, the moon grows larger every day. On the fifteenth day once again we get a full view of the moon. After fifteen days, the full moon changes into a new Moon.

          Question 80 B.
          <br/>
          What is meant by the phases of the Moon? What causes the phases of the Moon?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The different shapes of the bright part of the moon as seen during a month are called the phases of the moon. Moon is the natural satellite of the Earth. It revolves around the Earth. It completes one rotation on its axis as it completes one revolution around the Earth. The moon does not have light of its own. We are able to see the moon because the sunlight falling on its surface gets reflected towards us. We, therefore, see only that part of the moon, from which the light of the Sun is reflected towards us. The size of the illuminated part of the moon visible from the Earth increases each day after the new moon day. After the full moon day, the sunlit part of the moon visible from the Earth decreases in size every day. This process leads to the phases of the Moon.

          Answer:
          <br/>
          The stars appear to move in the sky. It appears because of the motion of the Earth. Earth is spinning around its own axis and also moves around the Sun. As a result, the stars also appear to move from east to west. A star which rises in the east in the evening, sets in the west in the early morning. All the stars do not appear to move. For example, pole star does not appear to move because it is situated in the direction of earthâ€™s axis.
