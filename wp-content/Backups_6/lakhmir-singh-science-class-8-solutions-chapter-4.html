          Lakhmir Singh Science Class 8 Chapter 4 Very Short Answer Type Questions
         </h3>
         <p>
          Question 1.
          <br/>
          What is the general name of the elements whose properties are intermediate between those of metals and nonmetals?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The elements whose properties are intermediate between the properties of metals and nonmetals are called Metalloids. For example, Boron, Silicon and Germanium are metalloids. Heat and electricity can pass through metalloids but not as easily as in metals. Metalloids are also called semiconductors.
         </p>
         <p>
          Question 2.
          <br/>
          Name one metals and one nonmetal which exist in liquid state at room temperature.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The metal which is liquid at room temperature is Mercury (Hg). Another metal called Gallium also exists as liquid at room temperature. Its melting point is very low and it changed into a liquid when touched.
         </p>
         <p>
          The nonmetal which is liquid at room temperature is Bromine.
         </p>

         </div>
         <p>
          Question 3.
          <br/>
          Name the property;
          <br/>
          (a) Which allows metals to be hammered into thin sheets.
          <br/>
          (b) Which enables metals to be drawn into wires.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) The property of metals which allows metals to be hammered into thin sheets is called Malleability. Due this unique property, metals can be flattened into thin sheets by hammering and rolling.
          <br/>
          (b) The property of metals which enables them to be drawn into wires is called Ductility. Due to this property metals can be stretched without breaking and drawn into thin wires. For example, Aluminum and copper are examples of highly ductile metals.
         </p>
         <p>
          Question 4.
          <br/>
          Name two metals which are soft and can be easily cut with a knife.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The two metals which are soft and easily cut with a knife are Sodium and potassium. The freshly cut surface of these metals is shiny but it tarnishes quickly on contact with air. This is because these metals react with oxygen and water and becomes dull grey in colour.
         </p>
         <p>
          Question 5.
          <br/>
          If a metal coin is dropped on hard floor, it produces a ringing sound. What is this property of metals known as?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The property of metals to produce sound is called Sonority. Metals produce ringing sound and are sonorous in nature.
         </p>

         <p>
          Question 6.
          <br/>
          Name the property of iron metal due to which it can be hammered to make objects of different shapes such as an axe, a spade or a shovel.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The property by which iron metal can be hammered to make objects of different shapes such as axe, spade etc. is called Malleability. As a result of high malleability, iron can be flattened or beaten into thin sheets and desired objects can be made by using it.
         </p>
         <p>
          Question 7.
          <br/>
          Name a non-metal which is very hard.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Diamond is the hardest non-metal. It is made of carbon atoms.
         </p>
         <p>
          Question 8.
          <br/>
          Name a non-metal which is good conductor of electricity?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Carbon, in the form of Graphite is a good conductor of electricity. It conducts heat and electricity like a metal or a metalloid.
         </p>

         <p>
          Question 9.
          <br/>
          State on chemical property which can be used to distinguish a metal from a non-metal.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The chemical property which can be used to distinguish between a metal and a nonmetal is the formation of positive ions by metals. Metals form positive ions whereas nonmetals form negative ions. As a result, oxides of metals are basic whereas the oxides of nonmetals are acidic in nature.

          Question 60.
          <br/>
          Give reasons for the following:
          <br/>
          (a) Sodium and potassium are stored in kerosene.
          <br/>
          (b) Copper cannot displace zinc from its salt solution (zinc sulphate solution).
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Metals react with water to produce hydrogen gas. Sodium reacts with water to form sodium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. Similarly, potassium also reacts with water to potassium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. Both Sodium and potassium are highly reactive metals. They can even react with the moisture present in air. The reaction of sodium and potassium with water is highly exothermic in nature. It produces a lot of heat energy and this heat energy can cause the hydrogen gas produced during the reaction, to catch fire. In order to keep it safe, sodium and potassium are stored in kerosene.
         </p>
         <p>
          (b) Copper cannot displace zinc from zinc sulphate solution. Zinc is placed above copper in reactivity series of metal. Hence, it will be able to replace copper from copper sulphate solution.
          <br/>
          Zinc + Copper Sulphate ➝ Copper + Zinc sulphate

          Question 61 A.
          <br/>
          Why are metals used for making bells?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Metals are sonorous because they produce a unique sound when something hard strikes their surface. As a result, metals are used in making bells or gongs.

          Question 61 B.
          <br/>
          Why is phosphorus kept under water?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Metals react with water to produce hydrogen gas. Phosphorus cannot be kept open in the air because it combines with oxygen so easily that it catches fire automatically. For safety, phosphorus is stored under water in chemical laboratories.

          Question 66 A.
          <br/>
          What are metals? Name five metals.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Metals are the elements which lose electrons to form cations and are electropositive in nature. For example, Sodium, potassium, Iron, Zinc and Calcium are metals. Metals are good conductors of heat and electricity. Metals are highly malleable and ductile. The property of metals which allows metals to be hammered into thin sheets is called Malleability. Due this unique property, metals can be flattened into thin sheets by hammering and rolling. The property by which iron metal can be hammered to make objects of different shapes such as axe, spade etc. is called Malleability. As a result of high malleability, iron can be flattened or beaten into thin sheets and desired objects can be made by using it. Sodium, Potassium, Copper, Aluminium, Mercury and sodium are metals.

          Question 68 A.
          <br/>
          What happens when sulphur dioxide is dissolved in water? Write a word equation for the reaction which takes place.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          When sulphur dioxide is dissolved in water, then it forms sulphurous acid (H
          <sub>
           2
          </sub>
          SO
          <sub>
           3
          </sub>
          ).
          <br/>
          Explanation: Metals react with oxygen to form metallic oxides. These metallic oxides are basic in nature because they react with water to form bases. On the other hand, non-metals react with oxygen to form non-metallic oxides and these oxides differ from metallic oxides because they are acidic in nature. Also, non-metallic oxides react with water to form acids.
          <br/>
          Sulphur is non-metal, and sulphur dioxide (SO
          <sub>
           2
          </sub>
          ) is acidic in nature. Thus, it reacts with water to form sulphurous acid (H
          <sub>
           2
          </sub>
          SO
          <sub>
           3
          </sub>
          or H
          <sub>
           2
          </sub>
          O.SO
          <sub>
           2
          </sub>
          )
          <br/>
          The chemical reaction is: SO
          <sub>
           2
          </sub>
          + H
          <sub>
           2

          Question 68 B.
          <br/>
          What happens when an iron nail is placed in copper sulphate solution? Write word equation of the reaction involved.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          If we put Iron nail into copper sulphate solution, the iron nail will displace copper from copper sulphate solution. The following changes will be observed:
          <br/>
          i) The colour of copper sulphate changes from blue to green after putting iron nails in it.
          <br/>
          ii) Reddish brown colour is deposited on the iron nails. This reddish brown colour is of copper.
          <br/>
          Because (Fe) is more reactive than copper (Cu) and is placed above copper in reactivity series of metals, thus and it changes into iron sulphate and copper.
          <br/>
          The chemical reaction is given below: Fe (Iron) + CuSO
          <sub>
           4
          </sub>
          (Copper Sulphate) → FeSO
          <sub>

          Question 91.
          <br/>
          Which of the following reactions will not occur? Why not?
          <br/>
          (a) Zinc sulphate + Copper ➝ Copper Sulphate + zinc
          <br/>
          (b) Copper Sulphate + Iron ➝ iron Sulphate + copper
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) This reaction will not occur. Zinc is more reactive than copper. Copper will not be able to replace zinc from zinc sulphate solution. A more reactive metal can replace a less reactive metal, but a less reactive one cannot replace a more reactive metal. On the other hand, if we take copper sulphate solution and zinc, then zinc will be able to replace copper from copper sulphate solution. Hence, the above reaction will not take place.
         </p>
         <p>
          (b) A more reactive metal can replace a less reactive metal, but a less reactive one cannot replace a more reactive metal. This reaction will take place. In this case, Iron is more reactive than copper. In a solution of copper sulphate, iron will react and will be able to displace copper from its solution. In this reaction, iron will change into iron sulphate and copper metal will be produced.
         </p>
         <p>
          Question 92.
          <br/>
          One day Reeta went to a jeweller’s shop with her mother. Her mother gave an old gold jewellery to goldsmith to polish. Next day when they brought the jewellery back, they found that there was a slight loss in its weight. Can you suggest a reason for the loss in weight?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          When gold jewellery is sent for polishing, it loses weight. While polishing, the outer thin layer of gold which is dull is removed by treatment with a chemical. The chemical treatment of this layer causes a reduction in weight of gold ornaments. This leads to a slight loss in the weight of jewellery.

          Question 93.
          <br/>
          An element burns in air to form an oxide. The aqueous solution of this oxide turns blue litmus paper red. State whether the element is a metal or nonmetal. Name one such element.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The aqueous solution of the oxide turns blue litmus paper red. This means the aqueous solution is acidic in nature. Metals react with oxygen to form metallic oxides. These metallic oxides are basic because they react with water to form bases. On the other hand, nonmetals react with oxygen to form nonmetallic oxides. These oxides are different from metallic oxides because they are acidic in nature. Nonmetallic oxides react with water to form acids. Since, the aqueous solution of this oxide is acidic in nature, the element is a nonmetal. For example, Sulphur is a nonmetal. It will form an oxide called sulphur dioxide which is acidic in nature.

          Question 94.
          <br/>
          An element burns in air to form an oxide. The aqueous solution of this oxide turns turmeric paper red. State whether the element is a metal or nonmetal. Name one such element.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Turmeric is used as a natural indicator. Turmeric is yellow in colour. Turmeric paper turns into red when it is dipped into basic solution. Turmeric paper does not change its colour with acid. The aqueous solution of this oxide turns turmeric paper red. It indicates that the oxide is basic in nature. Metals react with oxygen to form metallic oxides. These metallic oxides are basic because they react with water to form bases. On the other hand, nonmetals react with oxygen to form nonmetallic oxides. These oxides are different from metallic oxides because they are acidic in nature. Nonmetallic oxides react with water to form acids. Hence, the element is a metal. For example, magnesium is a metal, it reacts with oxygen to magnesium oxide, which is basic in nature.

          Question 95.
          <br/>
          The metal X reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid to form a gas Y. The metal X also reacts with sodium hydroxide solution (on heating) to form the same gas Y. When a lighted matchstick is applied, this gas burns by producing a ‘pop’ sound.
          <br/>
          (a) name two metals which could behave like X
          <br/>
          (b) Name the gas Y
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) The ‘pop’ sound indicates the presence of hydrogen gas. Metals react with dilute acids to form metallic salts and hydrogen gas. Some metals react with bases to produce hydrogen gas. Generally, non-metals do not react with acids. For example, Aluminium reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid to form Aluminium chloride and hydrogen gas. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:
          <br/>
          2Al(s) + 6HCl(aq) ➝ 2AlCl
          <sub>
           3
          </sub>
          (aq) + 3H
          <sub>
           2
          </sub>
          (g).
          <br/>
          Aluminium is an amphoteric metal. It reacts with both acids and bases. The reaction is highly exothermic and produces a lot of heat. There is rapid evolution of hydrogen gas during this reaction. Aluminium metal reacts with a base called sodium hydroxide to produce sodium aluminate and hydrogen gas.
         </p>
         <p>
          (b) The name of the gas is hydrogen.
