          Question 14.
          <br/>
          Were the Abbasid rulers able to abolish monarchy?
          <br/>

          Abbasid rulers were unable to abolish monarchy, because the needs of Government and the empire forced them to retain centralized army. The Abbasids who claimed to bring downfall of monarchy, established monarchy again by maintaining magnificent imperial architecture and court ceremonies initiated by the Umayyads.

          Question 18.
          <br/>
          How did Caliphate break up in the Arab Empire? Explain.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          From 9th century, the Abbasids state became weaker due to decline of Baghdad’s control over distant provinces and continuous struggle between pro-Arab and pro- Iranian groups in the army and bureaucracy.
         </p>
         <p>
          In 810, a civil war broke out between the supporters of two sons (Amin and Mamum) of the Caliph Harun-al-Rashid. This war created a new power block of Turkish slave officers. For the orthodoxy of power, the Shias started competing with Sunni. As a result of this, many new dynasties like Tahirid, Saminids and Tuluminds came into being.
         </p>
         <p>
          As a result of this, the Abbasid power got limited to the areas of central Iraq and western Iran. The Buyids captured Baghdad in 945 CE, which ended Abbasid supremacy.

         <p>
          Question 19.
          <br/>
          Describe the distribution of agricultural land in the conquered territories by the Arabs from the aspect of ownership.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The Arabs mainly practiced agriculture in the territories conquered by them. The Islamic states did not make any changes in it. Both small as well as the large land¬owners were the owners of the land. In some cases the land was also owned by the state.
          <br/>
          In Iran, the land was divided into very larger units, cultivated by peasants. Estate owners were given the responsibility of land revenue collection on behalf of the state during the Sassanian and Islamic periods. Land was a common property. In villages, people practiced both nomadic and settled agriculture. After Islamic conquests some changes began to take place. Big estate acquired by the state began to abandon by their land owners. Now they were handed over to the Muslim elites, especially to those who were the members of Caliph’s family.

          <br/>
          The Umayyad dynasty was brought down by a well-organised movement called ‘Dawa’. It was then replaced by Abbasids in 750. The main center of their uprising was the distant region of Khurasan.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The downfall of the Abbasid dynasty paved the way for the rise of the concept of Sultanate. The causes mainly responsible were:

         <ul>
          <li>

         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           From the very beginning, evidence has been traced out that Indian traders traveled to the different countries of South East Asia for trade in gold, tin, spices, etc. While travelling and trading to these nations they also took with them the ideas and practices of the religion. The ideology of Buddhism and Hinduism became the part and parcel of their culture. These two religions were adopted by the people of Jawa, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
           The Arab traders in the medieval period established their trade relations with India and many other countries of Europe and Asia. They carried with them the ideas of newly founded religion, i.e. Islam. Due to its simplicity in principle, Islam was adopted by many Indians and in the same way it spread into Spain, Syria, Iran and Iraq.
          </li>
          <li>
           The traders of the western countries, i.e. the traders of England, Holland, France, etc. spread their trading relations in many countries. They brought with them the ideas of Christianity. While trading, they also spread Christianity into different countries. Today this religion is adopted by the people of different countries of Asia and Africa.Keeping the above examples in mind, we can conclude that throughout the history human being’s interest in religion went hand in hand.

          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          What do you know about agriculture of the Central Islamic lands?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Agricultural was the main occupation of the settled population, since long. It also remained a major occupation in newly acquired territories. The bulk of income of the state was derived from the agricultural land.
         </p>
         <p>
          Land was owned by the small and big farmers and in some cases by the state. After Islamic conquests, big estates were abandoned and acquired by the state. Later on these states were handed over to Muslim elites. The chief among them were the members of Khalifa’s (Caliph’s) army.
         </p>
         <p>
          The land conquered by the Arabs, which remained in the hands of the owners were subjected to a tax, called Kharaj, varied from 1/2 to 1/5th of the produce. While the land cultivated by the Muslims were levied 1/10th of tax, known as ushr as land
          <br/>
          revenue. When non-Muslims started converting to Islam, the land revenue income fell dramatically. To meet the shortfall, the Caliphs decided to discourage the conversions and later adopted a uniform land revenue policy.
         </p>
         <p>
          After 10th century, the state authorised its officials to claim salaries from the agricultural territories called Iqtas (The person who held the Iqtas came to be known as Iqtadars). Agricultural prosperity and political stability went hand-in-hand. To ensure agricultural prosperity it took several measures such as canals were constructed, dams were built, the digging of wells, etc. were done. Tax concessions were granted to those people who brought land under cultivation. By the initiatives of peasants and state support the agriculture began to increase. Many new crops such as cotton, oranges, bananas, watermelon, spinach and brinjal began to grow and even exported to Europe.

          Passage 1.
         </p>
         <p>
          Islamic Calendar:
          <br/>
          The Hijri era was established during the caliphate of Umar, with the first year falling in 622 CE. A date in the Hijri calendar is followed by the letters AH.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Hijri year is a lunar year of 354 days, 12 months (Muharram to Dhul Hijja) of 29 or 30 days. Each day begins at sunset and each month with the sighting of the crescent moon. The Hijri year is about 11 days shorter than the solar year. Therefore, none of the Islamic religious festivals, including the Ramazan fast, Id and hajj, corresponds in any way to seasons. There is no easy way to match the dates in the Hijri calendar with the dates in the Gregorian calendar (established by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582 CE). One can calculate the rough equivalents between the Islamic (H) and Gregorian Christian (C) years with the following formulae:
          <br/>
          (H × 32 / 33) + 622 = C
          <br/>
          (C – 622) x 33 / 32 = H

          ‘I commend you not to learn your sciences from books unaided, even though you may trust your ability to understand. Resort to teachers for each science you seek to acquire; and should your teacher be limited in his knowledge take all that he can offer, until you find another more accomplished than he. You must venerate and respect him. When you read a book, make every effort to learn it by heart and master its meaning. Imagine the book to have disappeared and that you can dispense with it, unaffected by its loss. One should read histories, study biographies and the experiences of nations. By doing this, it will be as though, in his short life space, he lived contemporaneously with peoples of the past, was on intimate terms with them, and knew the good and bad among them. You should model your conduct on that of the early Muslims. Therefore, read the biography of the Prophet and follow in his footsteps. You should frequently distrust your nature, rather than have a good opinion of it, submitting your thoughts to men of learning and their works, proceeding with caution and avoiding haste. He who has not endured the stress of study will not taste the joy of knowledge. When you have finished your study and reflection, occupy your tongue with the mention of God’s name, and sing His praises. Do not complain if the world turns its back on you. Know that learning leaves a trail and a scent proclaiming its possessor; a ray of light and brightness shining on him, pointing him out.
