          Question 1.
          <br/>
          Read the passage carefully: [12]
          <br/>
          1. In 1991, Linnet visited a relative’s secluded village named Bhuira. Getting there was a backbreaking drive through the unpaved roads. Nestled among orchards and deodar woods, it delighted Linnet, who loves mountains and everything that grows there. Linnet and her husband soon bought a house with an acre of orchard. Peaches, apricots, plums and kiwis grew in and around Bhuira, along with Himachal’s famous apples. What concerned her was how so much of all that precious produce just went waste. Linnet had always baked and made jams, growing up as she did with the excellent seasonal produce of Somerset in England. She says her only qualification was that she knew how jam should taste. She began gathering the fallen fruit to make apple jelly.
         </p>
         <p>
          2. Today, Linnet not only produces what many consider India’s best jams, she’s single- handedly brought employment and prosperity to the farmers and the women of Bhuira village. Coming to India and setting up a house, she threw herself heart and soul into being an Indian wife. She wore sarees, became fluent in Hindi, and enjoyed making Kashmiri Pandit food. Linnet soon started looking like an Indian. “We could never find proper jams in India,” says Linnet. “There was this sugary red stuff that was called mixed fruit jam. So I started making jams with whatever I could lay hands on. The original mixed fruit jam was made by farmers’ wives in England when they had no time to make separate jams. So they put them all in one pot.
         </p>
         <p>
          3. Later in Bhuira, her jam became so popular that it got her thinking of expanding. “And the village women needed cash. At that time they had none,” Linnet recalls. Step by step, her dream took shape. There were negotiations with the authorities. The government set too many checks and didn’t realise how the jams could create more employment and help the local economy. Finally, she got the (FPO) Fruits Products Order Licence. A manufacturing unit was constructed close to the cottage and she started production in 1999. Initially, nobody took her seriously. In and around Bhuira, much of the fruit harvest had earned local farmers next to nothing because they didn’t have the means to box and transport such quantities , even to the nearest markets. Now even farmers with a few trees could just walk to the factory with their crop. Soon the women of Bhuira joined her. Linnet taught them the ways of jam-making as it had been passed down from her mother. The legend on the label of a Bhuira jam now reads, “Created by happy mountain women.”
         </p>
         <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
         </div>
         <p>
          4. Theif products quickly got sold out. The smiling girl brigade at the factory glow with a pride that’s almost visible. “They are hard-working and love the idea that jams bear the name of their village. Their income adds to the little they get from farms. They now also have their own self-help group to,.invest their precious earnings,” says Linnet. The factory has become a lifeline for many women – most of them not educated. Bhuira jam has now become a brand name in its own right. The all women operation needs many workers since every thing – sorting, chopping and cooking is done manually, which is what makes these jams unique. The jams have no artificial preservatives in them. Lime juice, apple juice and sugar are used as preservatives in the traditional manner.

         <p>
          Question 2.
          <br/>
          Read the passage given below carefully: [8]
          <br/>
          1. Cholesterol is a waxy substance that is present in our body. It’s an important component of our cell walls and other tissues, but it is thought to be harmful if in excess. It can lead to blockages caused by plaque formation in the heart’s arteries causing heart disease and heart attacks. Such blockages can also happen in arteries, in the legs or in the brain. Cholesterol is produced in the liver, and the amount produced is influenced by our genes. The food we consume, too, has effect on cholesterol levels. Fatty foods, especially those high in saturated fats, and foods high in simple sugars such as cold drinks increase cholesterol levels. Lack of physical activity and exercise also leads to elevated levels.
         </p>
         <p>
          2. We can reduce cholesterol levels by following a heart-healthy lifestyle, which includes regular physical activity for at least 30 minutes daily and a diet high in fruits and vegetables and low in saturated sugar. Statins are the group of drugs most recommended for those with high cholesterol. Red yeast rice has been shown to be effective in lowering cholesterol. Include garlic and flaxseed in your daily diet. Olive oil, Canola oil or other oils rich in monounsaturated fatty acids can be used for cooking in order to reduce cholesterol through food.
         </p>
         <p>
          3. The ill effects of high cholesterol take time to show, and you may not realise it until it’s a bit too late. Cholesterol, by itself is important because it insulates nerve cells and membranes. Being a fatty substance, it does not dissolve in the blood and is packaged into protein. There are the ‘good’ HDL cholesterol and ‘bad’ LDL cholesterol. Bad cholesterol can stick to the smooth lining of the blood vessels, where it is absorbed, while HDL mops up excess bad cholesterol and removes it from blood vessels. Even moderate physical activity can help increase HDL cholesterol.
         </p>
         <p>
          4. Exercise five days a week, whether you are overweight or underweight. Aerobic exercises like walking, cycling, swimming, slow jogging, dancing etc. for 45 minutes, three times a week and anaerobic exercises like weight training, and sprinting, for another three days will help increase good and reduce bad cholesterol. In order to maximize your cardiovascular fitness, aerobic exercises should raise your heart rate to a certain level. This level is called your target heart zone. Keep your heart rate elevated for at least 20 minutes. Always warm up, stretch, and cool down-relax-before and after any workout to avoid injuries. All these contribute to a healthier and fitter life.

          <br/>
          Write an article in 150-200 words on how fruitfully you are going to use your precious vote. What do you think are the qualities necessary for a candidate to become a good leader? You are Amrit/Amrita.

          YOUTH AND DEMOCRACY
          <br/>
          By: Amrit
          <br/>
          In most countries, the age of 18 is when you are legally and officially treated as an adult. This gives you the privilege to enjoy certain rights alongwith the need to fulfil certain duties. I have just turned 18 and become eligible to vote. I am looking forward to casting my vote in the upcoming elections. I feel a sense of patriotism and responsibility towards my country, more so, as an educated youth. My only concern is that I should be able to use my precious vote fruitfully and choose the most able candidate as our representative. The qualities that I seek in a good leader are that One who can be trusted and is known to live a life of honesty and integrity.
          <br/>
          True authority is born from respect for the good character and trustworthiness of the person who leads. A good leader instills confidence and followership by having a clear vision and passion for being truly successful. A leader must be strong and decisive but also humble. An able leader makes sustainable promises and is a person who sticks to his words. We should remember that a good leader is not innately born. So always choose and vote for a candidate who possesses the qualities of determination, self reflection, open¬mindedness, patience and knowledge.

          YOUTH AND MOBILE PHONES
          <br/>
          By: Amrita
          <br/>
          Technology has taken over every sphere of human life, the most popular being mobile phones which have drastically affected the lives of all people, especially youngsters who feel absolutely lost if they are without their cell phones.
          <br/>
          It has been seen that every technological-advancement that provides dramatic benefits has consequential costs and it is this area of mobile phone usage that needs attention, particularly their affect on youngsters. Parents are unable to understand their children’s obsession with their mobile phones. They find the so called ‘mobile culture’ stressful, causing a rift between members of a family. The younger generation has grown up with mobile phones and so are completely addicted to these devices.
         </p>
         <p>
          The worry over the impact of this mobile dependency on the present generation of youngsters is its addiction which makes them couch potatoes and gives them objectionable exposure. Since mobile phone is a safety device we cannot prohibit youngsters from using it but the solution lies in scheduling a fixed time for its usage, parent counselling and checking and diverting the attention of children and youngsters towards other constructive activities.
          <br/>
          The advantages or disadvantages of a mobile phone, like any other device, depends entirely upon its usage. The cell phone is very helpful and convenient and we should ensure its optimal and positive usage.

          Question 6.
          <br/>
          A newspaper had a news item on a clay modelling competition as part of the International Day of the Deaf. Inspired by it write a speech in 150-200 ivords to be delivered during the morning assembly on the problems of the differently abled and how we can make their lives comfortable in society. [10]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          We all have certain disabilities and feel handicapped somewhere or the other. But the main idea is to draw a line and differentiate between disability and differently abled.
          <br/>
          Good morning everyone, I, have come before you all to talk about the problems of the differently abled and how we can make their lives comfortable in society.
          <br/>
          I was greatly inspired on reading a newspaper report on a clay modelling competition as part of the International Day of the Deaf. It is heartening to see the changing attitude of our society towards the differently abled persons. Instead of making them feel dependent and under-confident we must ensure that they do not feel low or isolated. We must always lend them a helping hand but only when it is needed. We also need to treat the differently abled people as equal and give them equal and fair opportunities. It is during the last decade that we have witnessed a movement towards community based rehabilitation which has gained momentum and contributed towards greater independence and self¬sustainability of the differently abled persons into the societal mainstream.

          Man, by destroying nature, is putting his own life at risk. Write a speech in 150-200 words on the ways in which man destroys nature and the need to create awareness of the benefits of protecting nature.
          <br/>
          Ans. The value and importance of nature cannot be undermined and its conservation has been our primary concern. But unfortunately man has been destroying nature thereby putting
          <br/>
          his own life at risk. Good morning everyone, I have come to talk on the topic,
          <br/>
          ‘Depleting Nature, Man’s Doing’.
          <br/>
          Man’s selfishness, greed and desires are endless and uncontrolled and have led to the creation of concrete jungles. The result of this destruction of nature is an increase in barren land, soil erosion and pollution to name a few. Caring for nature and its resources and promoting their sustainable use is our essential responsibility to ensure our own survival and well being. Awareness needs to be created in schools and colleges through campaigns, assembly speeches and community rallies. NGOs need to get more active to curb all malpractices by the government and individuals. There should be a strict and firm control over industries to ensure that they adhere to rules of environmental guidelines on conservation. Nature has been given to mankind for-cohabitation. The pursuit of man’s technological advancement should not destroy nature and its resources. If man wants his future gene¬rations to enjoy living on the planet earth, he must take full responsibility to protect it now.

          <br/>
          (a) Why did Edla invite the peddler?

          (d) How does the world depicted on the classroom walls differ from the world of the slum children?

          <br/>
          (f) Why did Jo want the wizard to hit ‘mommy’?
          <br/>
          (g) Why did Zitkala-Sa hide herself?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Edla invited the peddler because she wanted to celebrate Christmas in the true spirit of the festival by having a guest over for Christmas supper. Moreover, she wanted to give the peddler a day of peace.
         </p>
         <p>
          (b) Mukesh was different from other bangle makers because he wanted to be his own master. He had a dream of becoming a motor mechanic whereas other bangle makers did not even dare to dream but had accepted their fate.
         </p>
         <p>
          (c) Beautiful things take away sadness and gloom from our spirits. They give us hope and joy. Whenever we think about a thing of beauty it brings a smile on our lips and is a source of joy forever.
         </p>
         <p>
          (d) The map of the world on the classroom walls is drawn in accordance with the will of the power lords. This world is not even remotely related to the world of the dirty slums. The world depicted in the pictures that decorate the walls holds a stark contrast with the world of the underfed poverty stricken slum children who live in cramped dark holes. The pictures suggest beauty, well-being and prosperity. So there is no connection whatsoever between the map of the civilized world to that of the world of the children.
         </p>
         <p>
          (e) Dr. Sadao met Hana in America. He met her in the most casual way, literally by chance, at an American professor’s house. The hospitable Professor Harley and his wife were anxious to do something for the foreign students and thus had invited them over. Dr. Sadao had actually nearly decided not to go to Professor Harley’s house that night because of the bad food and the professor’s voluble wife, but finally he had gone and there he had met Hana.
         </p>
         <p>
          (f) Jo wanted the wizard to hit ‘mommy’ because she had hit the wizard and made him change Roger Skunk’s smell back to a foul one. Jo wanted Roger Skunk to smell like roses so that he got the liberty to choose his own way and befriend other creatures,
         </p>
         <p>
          (g) Zitkala-Sa hid herself because she had got to know that the authorities wanted to cut her long hair. In her community hair of mourners, prisoners of war and cowards were cut and therefore she made a vain attempt to prevent her hair from being shingled by hiding herself.

          Gandhiji had great love for the poor. What did he do for the indigo farmers of Champaran?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The indigo sharecroppers in Champaran were being exploited by the British landlords. Gandhiji was called for help to alleviate their sufferings. At first he removed the peasants’ fear and united them. He then changed the professional mindset of the lawyers. He also made the landlords agree to return 25 per cent of the compensation. The landlords finally left Champaran. Then Gandhiji started his second mission of solving the problem of the cultural and social backwardness in Champaran. He spread awareness regarding sanitation, health and education. Since the health conditions were miserable, he got a doctor to volunteer his services for six months. After winning the peasants’ battle Gandhiji started working for the cultural and social upliftment of the poor and backward villagers.

          With the help of courage one can achieve a lot. How did Douglas overcome his fear of water? [6]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Douglas was afraid of water from a very young age. His misadventure at the $\mathrm{YMCA}$ pool further increased his water phobia. He was unable to enjoy fishing and boating trips. Finally he decided he had to overcome his fear. He could not do it without seeking professional help, so he appointed an instructor who gradually made him an excellent swimmer. Still Douglas was not satisfied. He made use of every opportunity to swim and dive in water thus challenging his fear. He was able to overcome his fear completely and this led him to make the statement that what one is afraid of is fear itself and if we are able to overcome that fear then we can achieve anything in life.

          What were the precautions taken by the prison authorities to prevent Evans from escaping? Ans. Evans was thoroughly searched and all sharp objects were taken away from him. He was put in a small cell with a guard right outside. McLeery, a parson, was appointed as the invigilator for Evan’s cell. McLeery’s belongings were also checked. Stephens, the police officer, was made to guard just outside his cell and looked through a peep hole after every minute. The governor fixed a bug in order to know the happenings in the cell and he himself sat in the control room to keep a thorough check. Every phone call was closely scrutinized. But inspite of all these precautions Evans managed to escape.

         <p>
          All possible precautions are taken by the prison officers to prevent Evans from escaping. Evans’ razor and nail scissors are removed from the cell. McLeery, the invigilator was frisked on arrival. Police officer, Stephens, was deputed on duty inside the cell. All the prison officials were put on high alert. There were two locked doors between Evans’ cell and the yard. A microphone was installed in the cell as a precautionary measure through which the warden could listen to their talk by switching on the receiver. The senior prison officer, Jackson and officer Stephens had worked round the clock and made fool-proof arrangements and taken all necessary precautions to ensure that the exam was conducted smoothly.

Since the cause of damage is negligent packaging at your end, you will need to replace the defective items at the earliest. It is my request to you to send the replacement for the above mentioned sports items without delay. We have been dealing with your company for the past five years and would like to continue our association for a long time. So we await prompt replacement of the defective sports items from your end.

          <br/>
          (a) The poet wants us to keep quiet and still and not move our arms and legs too much in the poem, Keeping Quiet. This will- give us the time to introspect over our actions and also help to create a feeling of mutual understanding among human beings.

          (e) When the king was a ten day old infant, the chief astrologer had predicted that a tiger would be responsible for the King’s death. So the king went on a tiger-killing spree but it was a wooden toy tiger that caused the Tiger King’s death. So despite getting rid of all the tigers in and around his kingdom, it was most ironic that the hundredth tiger, a wooden one, took its final revenge upon the King. A tiny sliver of wood from the wooden tiger pierces the King’s right hand which ultimately leads to his death.

          Question 9.
          <br/>
          Answer the following in 120-150 words: [6]
          <br/>
          Describe the atmosphere in the class on the day of the last lesson.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          On the day of the last French lesson the atmosphere in the class was strange and solemn. The school was as quiet as if it was a Sunday morning. The teacher (M.Hamel) moving in the class with his ruler under his arm was wearing his special dress for the last class. The elders of the village were sitting on the back benches of the classroom. All the students were studying with complete attention and the teacher was teaching with full dedication. All this was due to an order from Berlin that from the next day German would be taught instead of French by a new teacher.
          <br/>
          While delivering the last lesson, the teacher called upon his students and the village elders to guard the French language among themselves and never forget it, declaring French to be the most beautiful language in the world.

          How did Edla treat the peddler?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Edla was the daughter of the ironmaster. She was a warm, sensitive and compassionate person. She understood in the first meeting that the peddler was scared of someone and he had not had a single day of peace. So she decided to let him spend Christmas with them in their house. She assured him that he could leave anytime he wanted after celebrating Christmas with them. Edla woke him up to eat food only. Otherwise she let him sleep for two days. She showed genuine goodness which brought about a positive transformation in the peddler. She continues to treat him like a captain and the peddler, quite spontaneously, starts behaving like a real captain.

          Answer the following in 120-150 words: [6]
          <br/>
          A doctor is supposed to be gentle and humane. How did Sadao show these qualities in the story, “The Enemy”?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Dr. Sadao is gentle and humane. When he came to know that the stranger was an American soldier, he wanted to throw him back into the sea but could not. So he took him to treat him although he belonged to the enemy’s camp. Then he decided to hand the soldier over to the police after he had operated upon him and saved his life, but in the end was unable to do so. Instead he gave him proper post-operative treatment. He risked his and his family’s life by giving the stranger shelter. He even risked the resentment and wrath df his servants who were so upset with him for harbouring a soldier from the enemy’s camp that they left his house. Finally, Dr. Sadao gave the soldier his own boat, food and clothing and told him to sail to a nearby island and save himself. Dr. Sadao was not a traitor but could not let someone,, whom he had saved himself, die.

          Different generations can have different views. Such differences should be respected. What is the difference between Jo’s and Jack’s views on Roger Skunk story.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Difference in view and opinion is due to age, environment and situations and one cannot be blamed for having a particular opinion. Jo wanted Roger Skunk to retain his sweet smell of roses in place of his original foul smell. Jo is a small child for whom everything in life is beautiful and happy. Also for a child, his friends are an integral part of his life and Roger Skunk not having any friends could not be tolerated by Jo. Jack, the father, on the other hand was an experienced and mature adult who wished to teach life’s harsh realities to his daughter. So he insisted that Roger Skunk gets his foul smell back. Both were right in their own point of view and both were reacting according to their age.

          IMPORTANCE OF NEWSPAPERS IN LIFE
          <br/>
          By: Devika
          <br/>
          The 24-hour news channels have taken the world by storm. They have revolutionised the world which now appears closer and smaller. But surprisingly they have not been able to diminish the value of the newspaper which has been an integral part of our lives since years. Though news conveyed by TV news channels is quicker and faster, these, many a times, tend to omit facts and details about an incident and sometimes even sensationalise news without a reason. Here the newspaper comes in handy as it gives not only vital details but also contains more reliable news. Besides, the newspaper is easy to carry and can be read at any time. Further, the permanence of the printed word helps in refreshing one’s memory about certain facts and incidents reported in the past. Newspapers also contain many columns dedicated to advertisements like vacant situations, buying or selling of goods, information about missing persons, obituary news, etc.
         </p>
         <p>
          All this and much more information is contained only in the newspaper. Newspapers have been and will remain the mouthpiece of the nation and the unseen advisers of the common people. Newspapers are the oldest and most reliable source of news and information. The electronic media is at times unreliable, gives inadequate information and is not always available. Newspapers are not only most easily available but they are also the cheapest. Moreover newspapers are very important for students for a good exposure to English language and enhancement of their vocabulary through the “Editorial Column”. Newspapers are written with honesty and sincerity unlike the electronic media which sensationalizes news to increase TRPs and sometimes misleads public.

          Answer:
          <br/>
          ALARMING RISE IN ROAD ACCIDENTS
          <br/>
          By: Dev
          <br/>
          Road accidents have become the leading cause of death by injury and the tenth leading cause of all deaths globally. In India, the pressure on roads has been on an alarming rise and the lack of road sense has made matters worse.
          <br/>
          Driving licenses are issued on illegal gratifications to some drivers and traffic rules and regulations are rarely adhered to. The lack of tolerance and patience among drivers leads to an increased sense of anger and uncontrolled behaviour especially by the youngsters. Moreover the condition of roads needs to be improved and maintained. They are often full of potholes and their condition worsens during the rainy season.
         </p>
         <p>
          To prevent these accidents, it is imperative that effective long and short-term measures are effectively adopted. The traffic police needs to be more active and strict to ensure proper implementation of rules. Higher fines should be imposed and license of repeated offenders should be confiscated. There should be an effective check on the speed limit of vehicles. To minimise the number of road accidents proper awareness needs to be created among the masses regarding road safety alongwith importance of observation of traffic rules.
