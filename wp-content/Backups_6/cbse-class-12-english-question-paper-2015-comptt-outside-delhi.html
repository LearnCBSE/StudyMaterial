          Question 1.
          <br/>
          Read the passage carefully: [12]
          <br/>
          1. For four days, I walked through the narrow lanes of the old city, enjoying the romance of being in a city where history still lives-in its cobblestone streets and in its people riding asses, carrying vine leaves and palm as they once did during the time of Christ.
         </p>
         <p>
          2. This is Jerusalem, home to the sacred sites of Christianity, Islam and Judaism. This is the place that houses the church of the Holy Sepulchre, the place where Jesus was finally laid to rest. This is also the site of Christ’s crucifixion, burial and resurrection.
         </p>
         <p>
          3. Built by the Roman Emperor Constantine at the site of an earlier temple to Aphrodite, it is the most venerated Christian shrine in the world. And justifiably so. Here, within the church, are the last five stations of the cross, the 10
          <sup>
           th
          </sup>
          station where Jesus was stripped of his clothes, the 11
          <sup>
           th
          </sup>
          where he was nailed to the cross, the 12
          <sup>
           th
          </sup>
          where he died on the cross, the 13
          <sup>
           th
          </sup>
          where the body was removed from the cross, and the 14
          <sup>
           th
          </sup>
          , his tomb.
         </p>
         <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
         </div>
         <p>
          4. For all this weighty tradition, the approach and entrance to the church is nondescript. You have to ask for directions. Even to the devout Christian pilgrims walking along the Via Dolorosa-the Way of Sorrows-first nine stations look clueless. Then a courtyard appears, hemmed in by other buildings and a doorway to one side. This leads to a vast area of huge stone architecture.
         </p>
         <p>
          5. Immediately inside the entrance is your first stop. It’s the stone of anointing: this is the place, according to Greek tradition, where Christ was removed from the cross. The Roman Catholics, however, believe it to be the spot where Jesus’ body was prepared for burial by Joseph.
         </p>
         <p>
          6. What happened next? Jesus was buried. He was taken to a place outside the city of Jerusalem where other graves existed and there, he was buried in a cave. However, all that is long gone, destroyed by continued attacks and rebuilding; what remains is the massive-and impressive-Rotunda (a round building with a dome) that Emperor Constantine built. Under this, and right in the centre of the Rotunda, is the structure that contains the Holy Sepulchre.
         </p>

          7. “How do you know that this is Jesus’ tomb?” I asked one of the pilgrims standing next to me. He was clueless, more interested, like the rest of them, in the novelty of it all and in photographing it, than in its history or tradition.
         </p>
         <p>
          8. At the start of the first century, the place was a disused quarry outside the city walls. According to the gospels, Jesus’ crucifixion occurred ‘at a place outside the city walls with graves nearby ……’ Archaeologists have discovered tombs from that era, so the site is compatible with the biblical period.

          9. The structure at the site is a marble tomb built over the original burial chamber. It has two rooms, and you enter four at a time into the first of these, the Chapel of the Angel. Here the angel is supposed to have sat on a stone to recount Christ’s resurrection. A low door made of white marble, partly worn away by pilgrims’ hands, leads to a smaller chamber inside. This is the ‘room of the tomb’, the place where Jesus was buried.
         </p>
         <p>
          10. We entered in a single file. On my right was a large marble slab that covered the – original rock bench on which the body of Jesus was laid. A woman knelt and prayed. Her eyes were wet with tears. She pressed her face against the slab to hide them, but it only made it worse.

          (l) The word ‘tomb’ means the same as a large grave.
         </p>
         <p>
          Question 2.
          <br/>
          Read the passage given below: [8]
          <br/>
          It is surprising that sometimes we don’t listen to what people say to us. We hear them, but we don’t listen to them. I was curious to know how hearing is different from listening. I had thought both were synonyms, but gradually, I realised there is a big difference between the two words.
         </p>
         <p>
          Hearing is a physical phenomenon. Whenever somebody speaks, the sound waves generated reach you, and you definitely hear whatever is said to you. However, even if you hear something, it doesn’t always mean that you actually understand whatever is being said. Paying attention to whatever you hear means you are really listening. Consciously using your mind to understand whatever is being said is listening.
          <br/>
          Diving deeper, I found that listening is not only hearing with attention, but is much more than that. Listening is hearing with full attention, and applying our mind. Most of the time, we listen to someone, but our minds are full of needless chatter and there doesn’t seem to be enough space to accommodate what is being spoken.
          <br/>
          We come with a lot of prejudices and preconceived notions about the speaker or the subject on which he is talking. We pretend to listen to the speaker, but deep inside, we sit in judgement and are dying to pronounce right or wrong, true or false, yes or no. Sometimes, we even come prepared with a negative mind set of proving the speaker wrong. Even if the speaker says nothing harmful, we are ready to pounce on him with our own version of things.
         </p>
         <p>
          What we should ideally do is listen first with full awareness. Once we have done that, we can decide whether we want to make a judgement or not. Once we do that, communication will be perfect and our interpersonal relationship will become so much better. Listening well doesn’t mean one has to say the right thing at the right moment. In fact, sometimes if words are left unspoken, there is a feeling of tension and negativity. Therefore, it is better to speak out your mind, but do so with awareness after listening to the speaker with full concentration.
         </p>
         <p>
          Let’s look at this in another way. When you really listen, you imbibe not only what is being spoken, but you also understand what is not spoken as well. Most of the time we don’t really listen even to people who really matter to us. That’s how misunderstandings grow among families, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters.

          1.3 you hear what is said to you
          <br/>
          1.4 paying attention-means you are listening
          <br/>
          1.5 listening is using the mind consciously to understand what is said
         </p>
         <p>
          2. What is listening?
          <br/>
          2.1 more than hearing
          <br/>
          2.2 hearing with full attention \&amp; applying our mind
         </p>
         <p>
          3. What is not listening?
          <br/>
          3.1 While we listen our mind is full of needless chatter
          <br/>
          3.2 Not enough space to accommodate what is being said.
          <br/>
          3.3 Prej. and preconceived notions about the speaker give us a -ve mindset
          <br/>
          3.4 Even if the speaker says something harmless we pass our own judgement
         </p>
         <p>
          4. What one should really do?
          <br/>
          4.1 listen with full awareness – then make judgement
          <br/>
          4.2 comm. will then be perfect
          <br/>
          4.3 interpersonal relationship-become much better
         </p>
         <p>
          5. Listening well means
          <br/>
          5.1 not to say the rt. thing at the rt. moment
          <br/>
          5.2 sometimes if words are unspoken-feeling of tension \&amp; negativity
          <br/>
          5.3 better to speak your mind but with awareness after listening with full concern
          <br/>
          5.4 listening well enables us to imbibe both, i.e., spoken \&amp; unspoken
          <br/>
          5.5 when we do not listen to people who matter to us-misunderstandings grow
         </p>

         <p>
          (b) Summary: There is a big difference between hearing and listening. Hearing is a physical phenomenon but paying attention and applying the mind to what you hear is listening. If we come with preconceived notions about the speaker we sit in judgement and are ready to pounce on him. We must listen first with full awareness and then decide if we want to make a judgement. It is better to speak our mind but after listening to the speaker with full concentration. We must listen to people who matter to us and then there will be no misunderstandings.

          Education of girls .has been a high priority with the Government of India. In the new millennium India has consolidated its earlier educational reforms with increased resources and stronger policy commitments for achieving elementary education, particularly for girls. ‘Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan’ or ‘Education For All’ programme recognizes that ensuring the education of the girl child requires changes not only in the education system but also in society’s norms and attitudes. A two-pronged gender strategy has hence been adopted to make the educational system responsive to the needs of the girls through targeted interventions which serve as a pull-factor to enhance access and retention of girls in schools on the one hand and generate a community demand for girls’ education through training and mobilisation on the other hand. The CBSE has also come up with the novel scheme of providing free education from the sixth standard onwards to the single girl child.

         <p>
          If India wants to rank among the developed nations, it must give foremost priority to female education because if we educate a man, we educate an individual, but if we educate a woman we educate an entire family. If women are educated then problems like female infanticide, dowry, domestic violence, child marriage and other related atrocities will vanish. Education provides the essential criteria to fulfil certain economic, political and cultural functions and improves the socio-economic status of women. At every age and level education enhances the intellectual, social and emotional development of women and enables them to meet their basic needs. Thus most of the problems that our society today faces can be eradicated by educating the girl child.

          COACHING CLASSES: WASTE OF STUDENT’S PRECIOUS TIME
          <br/>
          By: Ram
          <br/>
          To attend coaching classes has become more of a trend which most students follow. This has happened because of the growing competition and the desire among students to excel. They feel that by attending these coaching classes they will be able to improve their grades but unfortunately it is a waste of their precious time. It makes them tired, affects their health and also their grades. Coaching classes have become synonymous in the lives of city students and students find it hard to cope up with their studies without them. Almost all students who attend coaching classes have lost their time for recreation and physical activities. Students sometimes travel long distances to attend the so-called ‘reputed’ coaching centres thus wasting a lot of time.
         </p>
         <p>
          In today’s cut-throat competition the life of students is as it is very stressful and combined with this stress is the extra burden of attending coaching classes. Parents too fail to realise how they are pressurising the children by making their already hectic work schedule more strenuous by enrolling them in coaching classes. Education is a natural process of learning and should not be forced upon the children. Students who over-estimate their stamina join these coaching classes and end up creating a mess of their daily routine.
          <br/>
          Students are running from one place to another for coaching and are unable to realise the value of time and time management. Not only are coaching centres unnecessary but are also adversely affecting the life of students.

          birthday. Good Morning children, I have come before you all to talk about ‘The value of cleanliness’.
          <br/>
          The importance of cleanliness cannot be ignored in individual as well as communal life. On the one hand it is an important factor for human health and spiritual development; on the other hand it is essential for environmental development. Cleanliness is one of the ‘must have’ habits in all individuals. The high value attached to cleanliness is aptly expressed by the proverb, “Cleanliness is next to Godliness”.
         </p>
         <p>
          We all need to do our bit to keep our surroundings and environment clean. Shrugging off our shoulders of the litter and dirt, cursing the government and civic agencies is just not right. Living in a society, we all have a moral responsibility to contribute to our surroundings. Set a good example and do not litter on roads and public places. Use dustbins and keep your surroundings clean. Cleanliness is a part of civilization and as civilized beings our foremost duty is to understand the value of cleanliness. To conclude, I quote the words of Mahatma Gandhi, “Sanitation is more important than independence”. Thank You

          You have always been proud of being a citizen of the country which shows love and care for elders. However, now this value is found to be disappearing. Write a speech in 150-200 words on ‘Difficulties faced by senior citizens.’
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          We have always been proud of being citizens of a country which shows love, compassion and care for elders. However now this value seems to be disappearing.
          <br/>
          Good morning Everyone, I have come before you all to talk about the “Difficulties faced by senior citizens.” Deteriorating health, malnutrition, lack of shelter, financial incapacity are some of the most common problems that senior citizens face. Combined with these are isolation, rejection by family and callous attitude of their children. The number of ‘living – alone’ seniors has also increased in recent times as seniors with non-resident children or out of station children are forced to live alone. In today’s materialistic world, where everyone is over-busy, it amounts to too much expectation if senior citizens expect their kith and kin to attend to their requirements or pay them frequent visits.
         </p>
         <p>
          The problems faced by senior citizens need to be tackled through holistic care, that is by paying attention to the preventive, promotive and rehabilitative aspects of caring for them. Moreover awareness needs to be created regarding elderly persons that can help them to lead productive and independent lives. With a view to ensure the well-being of senior citizens we need to strengthen their legitimate place in society and extend support for financial security and health care. Let us not forget that all the religions in the world have been advocating to respect and look after elderly parents and senior citizens. As directed by the fifth commandment of the Bible ” Honour your father and mother.”

          (g) How did the instructor make Douglas a good swimmer?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Due to his handicap, his burnt face, Derry suffered from an acute lack of self-regard and rejection. He did not like being with people because they constantly reminded him of his ugliness and so he stayed away from them. He felt he was too ugly to be liked and loved by anyone so he became a recluse.
         </p>
         <p>
          (b) The Maharaja had annoyed a senior British Officer and was in danger of losing his throne. To make amends he sent about fifty samples of expensive diamond rings to the officer’s wife in the hope that she would keep one or two rings as a bribe. But the greedy lady kept all the rings. The Maharaja lost three lakh rupees but he managed to retain his kingdom.
         </p>
         <p>
          (c) The poem ‘Keeping Quiet’ emphasises the need for quiet introspection and creating a feeling of mutual understanding among human beings. It conveys to us the poet’s philosophy of an exotic moment of silence which will be an antidote to violence, hatred and war.
         </p>
         <p>
          (d) The roadside stand was built by the rural folk in front of the little old house at the edge of the road. It was a little new shed, an extension of an old house. It was put up there to attract the city folk as customers to sell wild berries and golden squash.
         </p>
         <p>
          (e) Edla’s warmth, sympathy and compassion bring about a change in the life of the peddler. He is touched by the kind treatment Edla gives him despite knowing his real identity. The latent goodness of his heart is awakened and he actually behaves like a true captain.
         </p>
         <p>
          (f) The bulletin board news that caused a change in the school was that, that day was going to be the last French lessen for the schools of Alsace and Lorraine. The order had come from Berlin to teach only German in the schools and their new German teachers would come the next day.
         </p>
         <p>
          (g) To ‘build a swimmer’ out of Douglas, the instructor began his training with extreme caution. He attached a rope to a belt and put it around Douglas. The rope went through a pulley that ran on an overhead cable. Supported by the cable, they went to and fro in the pool and practiced for weeks together. The instructor taught Douglas to put his face under water and exhale and to raise his nose and inhale. He then taught him to kick in water for many weeks. Finally after seven months, the instructor told him to swim the length of the pool and Douglas’ persistent fear started fading.

          How did a visit to Champaran become a turning point in Gandhi’s life? How does this show Gandhi’s love and concern for the common people of India?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The Champaran episode began as an attempt to fight against the injustice towards the hapless peasants to alleviate their sufferings. It later turned out to be Gandhiji’s loud pronouncement that the Britishers could not order him about in his own country. It established the effectiveness of non-cooperation as a means of fighting for justice. Gandhiji did not get intimidated either by the British officials or by their offers. The Champaran episode was not an outcome of defiance of authorities but it was a result of sincere efforts to relieve the suffering of the masses. It revealed Gandhiji’s principles in the political field. After winning the peasants’ battle against the English landlords Gandhiji stayed on in Champaran for the cultural and social upliftment of the poor and backward villages of Champaran.

          Ans. Every teenager must dream big. Yet the dream should also be rooted to the ground. This state¬ment is so true for Sophie whose dreams are larger than life and far supercede her real life. Sophie had rather unrealistic plans for her future. She wanted to own a boutique and have the most amazing shop in the city. She also dreamed of being an actress or a fashion designer. Considering her meagre resources and family’s position, her dreams are quite unrealistic, in fact they are in sharp contrast to her reality. Her father works hard for a living and is never likely to be a part of the sophisticated world. Her mother bears the back-breaking burden of household chores. Her brother works as an apprentice mechanic. Considering her circumstances she would actually have to work in the biscuit factory. So her dreams would just remain dreams and never become a reality.

          How does Jo want the story to end and why?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Jo was Jack’s four year old daughter who loved to listen to the stories which Jack himself created. Each story that Jack narrated to her was a slight variation of a basic tale. One day’s story was about Roger Skunk, a new animal who smelt so bad that the other little creatures never played with him due to this. When Roger Skunk told his tale to the wise owl, he advised him to go to the wizard. The wizard made Roger smell like roses but when Roger returned home his mother was so annoyed that she went to the wizard and hit him on the head. The wizard made Roger Skunk smell bad again. Jo did not like the end of the story.
          <br/>
          For Jo, Roger’s mother is wicked and she is very annoyed with her for making Roger smell bad again. Jo is a child who “lives in an idealised world which is reigned by beauty and love. So she wants her father to change the story’s ending wherein the wizard should hit mommy with her magic wand and punish her for being stupid.

          The first day in the land of apples was bitterly cold and as the bell rang for breakfast, there was an annoying clatter of shoes which gave Zitkala-Sa no peace. Though her spirit tore itself in struggling for its freedom, it was of no use. Zitkala-Sa was placed in a line with the Indian girls and marched into the dining room. All the girls were rather immodestly dressed in tightly .fitting clothes. As Zitkala-Sa sat down she observed that she was being keenly watched by a strange palefaced woman. Later her friend Judewin gave her a terrible warning that this palefaced woman was talking about cutting their long, heavy hair. Zitkala-Sa crept into a room and crawled under a bed and huddled herself in the dark corner. But women and girls entered the room and dragged her out. She resisted by kicking and scratching wildly. Inspite of her resistance she was carried downstairs, tied fast in a chair and her long hair was shingled.

          Since the past three weeks the drinking water that is being supplied to our colony is very dirty and has a foul smell. It is not even suitable for cleaning and washing purpose. We have been buying drinking water and paying water tankers to supply water to us for three weeks now. Despite repeated complaints to the Water Authority no action has been taken so far. This problem has become a serious issue which is bound to take a toll on our health and our pockets. I hope you will consider this problem seriously and give it top priority. We request you to take strict and immediate action in this matter and hope to get a favourable response from your end at the earliest.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) The peddler was received very warmly and received generous hospitality at the crofter’s home. The crofter, an old and lonely man, served him porridge, treated him kindly and the two smoked and played cards. This made the peddler feel very happy.

          (b) Derry suffers from an acute sense of complex after one side of his face got burnt by acid. He stays away from people who constantly remind him of his ugliness. He does not like to see people shirking from him because he is ugly. He feels rejected and unwanted.
         </p>
         <p>
          (c) Aunt Jennifer’s tigers possessed all the qualities that Aunt Jennifer did not have. The tigers were free, fearless, confident and proud whereas Aunt Jennifer was meek, submissive and without any identity. She was a rather indecisive woman unlike the confident tigers she had created.
         </p>
         <p>
          (d) Ironically, the hundredth tiger is not killed by the Tiger King. He does drop down after he is shot by the Maharaja, but he only faints from the bullet shot. The hunters then wonder what they should do. They realize if the Maharaja came to know this they, could lose their jobs. So one of the hunters takes aim and shoots the tiger.

          (e) It took Bama half an hour to one hour to walk home from her school, although it was possible to cover the distance in ten minutes. This was because on the way many attractions slowed her down. These included fun, games, entertaining novelties and oddities in the streets, the shops and the bazaar.
         </p>
         <p>
          (f) Gandhiji had asked the indigo planters for a 50 per cent refund to the farmers but they offered only 25 per cent. Gandhiji still agreed to their offer because for him the amount of the refund was of less importance. More important was the fact that the planters had been forced to surrender part of their rights. So he agreed to their settlement.

          Question 10.
          <br/>
          Answer the following in 120-150 words.
          <br/>
          What were the precautions taken by the prison officers to prevent Evans from escaping?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          All possible precautions are taken by the prison officers to prevent Evans from escaping. Evans’ razor and nail scissors are removed from the cell. McLeery, the invigilator was frisked on arrival. Police officer, Stephens, was deputed on duty inside the cell. All the prison officials were put on high alert. There were two locked doors between Evans’ cell and the yard. A microphone was installed in the cell as a precautionary measure through which the warden could listen to their talk by switching on the receiver. The senior prison officer, Jackson and officer Stephens had worked round the clock and made fool-proof arrangements and taken all necessary precautions to ensure that the exam was conducted smoothly.

          How does Jo react to the skunk’s story? Why? [6]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Jo reacts rather strongly to skunk’s story. She totally disagrees with the story’s ending and wants the wizard to hit skunk’s mommy who Jo thinks is stupid.
          <br/>
          Adults are mature, experienced and have a practical approach. Their responses are tutored and their actions reflect their thoughts. But children are spontaneous with natural, untutored responses. Jo, a four-year old child, prefers to live in her world of dreams and fantasies. She would like to wreak vengeance on Skunk’s mother and is annoyed because her father refuses to accept her suggestion. The father has a mature perspective and so he views things beyond the ‘face-value’ and delves into the philosophical and moralistic aspect of the entire situation. The wizard, according to him, had interfered with nature and so deserved to be punished. Jo completely disagrees with her father. For her the baby Skunk was right and it made perfect sense if the wizard hit the ‘stupid’ mommy.

          Teenagers often feel confused. They face a lot of pressure from various quarters. Write an article in 120-150 words, on ‘Stress the teenager’s face’. You are Ram/Rama. [10]

          Answer:
          <br/>
          STRESS THE TEENAGER’S FACE
          <br/>
          By: Ram
          <br/>
          The teen stage of one’s life is filled with stress and anxiety. This is because it is that stage of our life when we face a host of novel problems and pressures from various quarters. To start with teenagers experience many significant physical changes and at times they find it difficult to cope with their bodies that grow and develop rapidly.
          <br/>
          Combined with this is social pressure, peer pressure and parental pressure. Most teenagers feel that academic concerns feature at the top of their list of stress stimulants. Worries about their future, the tension to attain good grades and cut-throat competition cause teenagers to experience inordinate amount of stress.
         </p>
         <p>
          The stress that teenagers face today may vary from academic pressure, physical appearances, peer pressure etc. but these issues can be dealt with if parents and guardians understand these problems and approach them in a positive and friendly manner. Proper guidance is vital especially in this very formative phase in the life of children so that they can grow up to be confident and optimistic adults. Finally teenagers need to develop assertiveness, training skills and learn practical coping skills. They should always feel good about doing a competent job rather than demanding perfection from themselves and others.

          TV and Internet have reduced the charm of reading for children. Write an article in 120-150 words on the reasons for this lack of interest. Suggest measures to create a desire to read among children right from a very young age. You are Ram/Rama.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          LACK OF INTEREST IN READING
          <br/>
          By: Rama
          <br/>
          Reading is an essential tool for lifelong learning. It has a vital role to play in overall development. Reading enables us to extend our scope of knowledge and experience.
          <br/>
          But due to technological development the charm of reading has considerably reduced for children. They spend so much time glued to the TV and internet that reading a book in a quiet and peaceful corner of their homes or library has become an archaic idea for most children. This fast declining interest in reading culture among children is a cause of concern and challenge to all and we need to take up measures to alleviate this problem. The desire for reading needs to be inculcated among children from a very young age. Parents should read out books to their kids from the time when they are incapable of reading. This way children learn that reading is fun and not a chore. This will also help to promote their attention span which is an important skill for a child to concentrate. To develop the habit of reading in children requires a number of skills that, in most children, has to be formed by direct and informed instruction provided through constant reiteration.
