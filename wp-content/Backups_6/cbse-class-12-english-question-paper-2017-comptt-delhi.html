          1.2 On the basis of your understanding of the above passage, answer the following questions: [1 × 7 = 7]
          <br/>
          (f) What did Jane Austen like?
          <br/>
          (g) Why do you think Graham Green hired a secret office?
          <br/>
          (h) What was the rumour about Erik Satie’s productivity?
          <br/>
          (i) How did her limited social life affect Simone de Beauvoir?
          <br/>
          (j) In what way did T.S. Eliot’s day job help him to write?
          <br/>
          (k) What makes it easier for one to stay on the path?
          <br/>
          (l) Which word in the passage (para 1) means the same as glance / look?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (f) Jane Austen liked a private workplace. She did not want a certain squeaky hinge to be oiled so that it warned her whenever someone was approaching the room where she wrote.
          <br/>
          (g) Graham Green hired a secret office because he needed a workplace where he could work on his creation uninterruptedly.
          <br/>
          (h) Erik Satie used to stop under street lamps on his long hikes from Paris to the place where he lived in the working-class suburb, and jot down ideas that came to his mind during the walk. It is rumoured that when those street lights were turned off during the war years, his music too declined.
          <br/>
          (i) Simone de Beauvoir led a limited social life. There were no receptions or parties. It was an uncluttered kind of life, a deliberately constructed simplicity so that she could concentrate on her work.
          <br/>
          (j) T.S. Eliot found it much easier to write once he had a day job in a bank than he could as a starving poet.
          <br/>
          (k) Following a routine and leading an organized life may be irritating but it makes it easier for one to stay on the path.
          <br/>
          (l) The word ‘peep’ means the same as glace/look.
         </p>
         <p>
          Question 2.
          <br/>
          Read the passage below: [8]
          <br/>
          The Great Wall of China was built to link existing fortifications into a united defense system and better keep invading Mongol tribes out of China. It is the largest man-made monument ever to have been built and it is said that it is the only one visible from space. Many thousands of people must have given their lives to build this huge construction. The Great Wall of China is a series of towers made of stone, brick, earth, wood and other materials, generally built along an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of the various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were being built as early as the 7th century BCE; these, later joined together and made bigger and stronger, are now collectively referred to as the Great Wall.
         </p>
         <p>
          Especially famous is the wall built (220-206 BCE) by Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China. Little of that wall remains. Since then, the Great Wall has on and off been rebuilt, maintained and enhanced; the majority of the existing wall is from the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).
          <br/>
          Other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and emigration. Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of watch towers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Great Wall stretches from Dandong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, along an arc that roughly delineates the southern edge of Inner Mongolia. A comprehensive archaeological survey, using advanced technologies, has concluded that the Ming walls measure 8,850 km. This is made up of 6,259 km sections of actual wall, 359 km of trenches and 2,232 km of natural defensive barriers such as hills and rivers. Another archaeological survey found that the entire wall with all of its branches measures out to be 21,196 km. King Zheng of Qin conquered the last of his opponents and unified China as the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty (“Qin Shi Huang”) in 221 BCE. Intending to impose centralized rule and prevent the resurgence of feudal lords, he ordered the destruction of some sections of the walls, however, he ordered building of new walls to connect the remaining fortifications along the empire’s northern frontier. Transporting the large quantity of materials required for construction was difficult, so builders always tried to use local resources. Stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges, while earth was used for construction in the plains.
          <br/>
          The Great Wall concept was revived under the Ming dynasty in the 14th century, to gain a clear upper hand over the Mongolian tribes.

          Subject: School’s role in ensuring fruitful internet usage among students
          <br/>
          Sir
          <br/>
          Through the medium of the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I wish to express my concern about students wasting their precious time on the internet merely for entertain¬ment and also point out how school authorities can control students’ netsurfing at school. With the increasing internet usage in schools across the country it is imperative for schools to consider the responsibility of giving students guidance in becoming productive net- users. As internet services enter the classrooms and students are being exposed to the full range of what is available on the net, it should be in the domain of the school authorities to enable students to manage their capabilities in utilising the net for knowledge, learning skills, gaining information on any and every subject. Students should be counselled to function productively alongside distraction. They should be conditioned to think of this social media not only as escape medium to drown out other essential tasks but as something that can be integrated for gaining information and knowledge. There should be supervision for net-surfing in schools so that students do not waste away time using the internet merely for entertainment.
          <br/>
          I hope you will publish my letter in your “newspaper so that the school authorities take up measures to ensure fruitful usage of internet among students.
          <br/>

          Question 5.
          <br/>
          You are Ram/Rajani, a nutritionist. You have been invited to speak on ‘Healthy Food’. Prepare a speech in 150-200 words pointing out how healthy food contributes to physical and mental well-being. [10]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          There is enough evidence to prove that healthy food contributes to our physical and mental well-being. Good Morning everyone!… I am Ram, a nutritionist and I am here to speak on ‘Healthy food’ and its benefits and how good nutrition powers our life.
          <br/>
          Healthy food fuels all bodily processes and increases your strength, agility, coordination, immunity endurance and level of performance. It supplies the source of power for our body as well as our brain and keeps us physically and mentally fit. Eating nutritious food that contains a lot of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants nourishes both the body and the brain and protects them from oxidative stress.
          <br/>
          Unhealthy food choices lead to obesity and illness. This foods zap your energy, hinder you from socializing with your family and friends and thus leave nothing for you to look forward to. If you have a difficulty in overcoming bad dietary habits, I suggest you speak to your doctor or consult a nutritionist or dietician about making better food choices based on your personal lifestyle and food preferences.
          <br/>
          Eating healthy will definitely have a positive impact on our waistline, but also remember that it will also have a good effect on our mental well-being. From reducing our risk from depression to protecting us from degenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s, a healthy and well-balanced diet truly nourishes us from inside out.

          into a superficial contest that encourages us to play to the best of our capability. There are very good underlying reasons why sports fascinate so many of us so much so and why sports attract numerous participants. Sports help everyone to improve and maintain physical ability and skills. Sports play a great positive role in everyone’s busy life especially for students. Everyone should involve themselves in any sports activity even for a small time during the day. Sports are .necessary because they bring physical and mental fitness. Sports not only provide physical strength, they increase mental power too. Outdoor sports such as football, cricket, volleyball, hockey etc. help in improving physical health. However, some indoor games like brain games, chess, sudoku etc. improves mental power and concentration.
          <br/>
          The rapid growth of interest in sports in the recent decades is proof enough that it is certainly not a wastage of time but an activity that strengthens our body, mind, spirit and general well-being.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Sports seem entirely without purpose. There are health benefits associated to the playing of sports but is that all what it is about? It can be argued that there are other equally efficient ways to attain fitness. So, why do we participate in sports?
          <br/>
          Good Morning everyone! I …., have come before you all to speak on the topic: ‘Participation in sports is a mere wastage of time’. I will speak against the motion because sports are not meaningless and the fascination that so many of us have for sports and the heights it can achieve is very well-placed. Participating in sports provides us with the opportunity to exercise our talent, skills and abilities.
          <br/>
          When we play sports, we pit our abilities and power against those of the others. We enter into a superficial contest that encourages us to play to the best of our capability.

          Question 6.
          <br/>
          You are Ram/Rajani. You feel that India, with its rich and varied heritage, linguistic and cultural diversity is an excellent destination for tourism. Promoting tourism will surely promote our economy. Write an article titled, ‘Promoting Tourism is Promoting Ourselves’, in 150-200 words, specifying the advantages of promoting tourism and how it can be accomplished. [10]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          PROMOTING TOURISM IS PROMOTING OURSELVES
          <br/>
          By: Ram
          <br/>
          India is a vast country, with a rich and varied heritage, linguistic and cultural diversity and therefore its tourist potential is equally vast. Promoting tourism will also play a vital role in the development of our country as it is an important source of earning foreign exchange.
          <br/>
          Tourism has become a thriving global industry with the power to have a positive impact on the developing countries. It is the largest service industry in India, so the Ministry of Tourism, the nodal agency for developing and promoting tourism in India runs and maintains the “Incredible India” campaign.
          <br/>
          India is a large country with a rich cultural heritage and so it has the potential to provide great geographical and cultural diversity to tourists. Inspite of this the number of tourists visiting India is decreasing rapidly every year.
          <br/>
          It’s always easy to have discussions on what the tourism industry should do and what it is not doing. Cleanliness, hygiene and safety are factors most tourists thrive upon and in this sector our country’s progress lags behind, mainly because there are no stringent laws that are effectively implemented.
         </p>
         <p>
          Indian tourism industry has been hit by pollution. Resolving these issues by imposing heavy fines on the polluters, enforcing consumer laws, ensuring security of tourists, especially females and providing decent and hygienic accommodation will go a long way in promoting tourism and thereby salvaging the much needed foreign exchange for our country. Also the tourist infrastructure in India should be strengthened. Airports and railway stations should provide accurate and reliable information to foreign tourists about tourist destinations, hotels, taxis, etc. Government owned hotels should be managed properly. The Government should take steps to restore the splendour of the ancient monuments and also take appropriate steps for the upkeep and maintenance of the various tourist destinations.
          <br/>
          Although the tourism industry has initiated many improvements lately, we still have a long way to go so as to ensure tourism alone is able to generate significant revenue for the country.

          INDEPENDENCE DAY CELEBRATION
          <br/>
          By: Head Girl
          <br/>
          Our school celebrates Independence Day with great zeal and enthusiasm every year and this year too was no exception. The students, under the able guidance of our principal and teachers had been preparing for the Independence Day celebrations for weeks in advance. Early in the morning of the 15th of August we gathered in our school grounds where the flag was hoisted by our Chief Guest, District Magistrate, Ms. Indu Bala Sharma. Everyone stood in attention to salute and pay respect to the Tricolour. The School Scouts band played our National Anthem. After the flag hoisting ceremony, our Chief Guest delivered a speech on the significance of the day and reminded us of our duties towards our country.
         </p>
         <p>
          Thereafter, a colourful cultural programme was presented by the students who celebrated the gift of freedom enjoyed by this generation through the medium of singing and dancing. Our principal then addressed the gathering urging the students never to forget the sacrifices of the martyrs and patriots who laid down their lives during the Freedom struggle. He advised the students to follow the path of our historical leaders and work towards liberating India from the clutches of social evils like poverty, illiteracy and corruption.
          <br/>
          Our Independence Day celebrations concluded with a vote of thanks by our Vice principal and thereafter everyone once again stood up as the National Anthem was played.

          Either way, Antarctica is a crucial element in this debate – not just because it’s the only place in the world, which has never sustained a human population and therefore remains relatively ‘pristine’ in this respect; but more importantly, because it holds in its ice-cores half-million-year-old carbon records trapped in its layers of ice.

          We always admire those as heroes who face challenges bravely in different phases of life and emerge successfully. Elaborate on this statement with reference to William Douglas.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Determination and perseverance is a combination of attributes and abilities that drive people to set goals for themselves and then to take the initiative to achieve these goals. Douglas was able to overcome his fear of water by the values of positive attitude and courage. Initially he was afraid of water but his grit and determination made him get an instructor and overcome his fear. Determination today leads to our success tomorrow. It is that innate quality in our soul, which comes to surface when an incident irks it. It is a reflection of our values taught to us by society and circumstances and enables us to overcome all obstacles.
         </p>
         <p>
          There is always admiration for heroes like William Douglas who face challenges courageously and finally emerge successful. For years the fear of water haunted him. It deprived him of the joy of canoeing, swimming, fishing and boating. However, it was deliberate, planned and continuous efforts that enabled Douglas to get over his fear. He was absolutely determined to get rid of his fear and it was due to his perseverance and resoluteness that he emerged victorious.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          There is no denying the fact that Gandhiji’s values and ideologies have been admired by one and all. In the lesson ‘Indigo’ wfe”get a glimpse of his certain traits that we should adopt in our own life. When Gandhiji reached Champaran, his main aim was to solve the problem of the sharecroppers and he worked towards that cause relentlessly. This quality enabled him to overcome all obstacles. Despite his unassuming and simple personality Gandhiji did not get intimidated by the British. He dared to face each situation fearlessly and nothing could deter him from his path.

          Describe three tricks used by Evans to escape from the prison.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Evans was a master planner and was called “Evans the Break” by the prison officers as he was a habitual jail breaker. To implement his plan to escape from prison this time he brought in a duplicate, McLeery to invigilate during the O-level German examination that he was appearing for in the jail premises. Later when the duplicate McLeery escapes, pos¬ing as Evans, the real Evans pretends to be wounded and tells the prison officials he can help to locate Evans who has escaped. Everyone thinks Evans had escaped after hitting McLeery. Then McLeery, who is actually Evans, demands to be taken in a police van to follow Evans. He even shows the cleverly superimposed photocopied sheet on the ques¬tion paper that was supposed to give the details of Evan’s escape plan. The scheming Evans carries out all his plans right under the noses of the prison officials, outwitting them at every step and finally has the last laugh.

Prepare a speech in 150-200 words, giving your views on books, how they can be our.best friends and how they happen to be better than real human friends and how they can lead us to the great hobby of reading. [10]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Man is a social being and so he needs friends. It could be the company of fellowmen or animals and there are many of us who love our association with books. Good Morning everyone! I am Rajani, an academic counsellor, and I have been invited to speak on the topic, ’Books are Our Best Friends.’
          <br/>
          I would like to start my talk with a quote by Charles William Eliot: “Books are the quietest and most constant of friends; they are the most accessible and wisest of counselors and the most patient of teachers.” Books are our companions and they enrich our mind with good thoughts and are a storehouse of knowledge. Moreover reading inspirational books motivates us to achieve great heights and overcome our failure. Like it is with friends, it is our responsibility’ to choose the books we read wisely.
          <br/>
          Books are our most accessible friends whose company we can enjoy at any time and place.
         </p>
         <p>
          Befriending good books is the medicine of life as they happen to be better than real human friends and can lead us to the wonderful hobby of reading. Like good friends books enrich our personality and enable us to take up a positive approach towards life. They engage us productively and also build up our level of concentration. J.K. Rowling very rightly said, ” Ido believe something very magical can happen when you read a good book.”
          <br/>
          To conclude, I would like to say books enlighten us and those of you who develop the habit of reading will find yourself more knowiedgable and well-informed. So make sure you enjoy the company of these selfless friends.

          You are Ram/Rajani, participating in a debate. Write a debate either for or against the motion: ‘Hard work, and not only good luck helps us to achieve success in life’. (150-200 words)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Whenever we talk about successful people we refer to them as ‘lucky’. This term actually means an opportunity or a good fortune. But then how do these people get repeated success. I would say this luck is a confluence of hard work and perseverance.
          <br/>
          Good Morning everyone! I, Ram have come before you all to debate on the topic, “Hard work, and not only good luck helps us to achieve success in life.” I will be speaking in favour of the motion. Opportunities present themselves to each person at various stages of their life. But only those people who recognize and seize them without delay, succeed. These are the people we refer to as ‘lucky’. No success is achieved without toil and hard work.
         </p>
         <p>
          Besides working hard, it is imperative to remain focused. To realize your full potential you must focus on your goals in such a way that you are able to achieve a balance between what you want and how you are going to get it. But always remember hard work has no substitute. If you assess the history of successful people you will see that their hard work and laborious effort was instrumental to their success. I have always felt that the so-called concept of ‘good luck’ is somewhat mysterious and rather difficult to explain.

          I would like to conclude by saying that the only thing that overcomes ‘hard luck’ is hard work and this helps us to achieve success in life.

          Question 5.
          <br/>

          SLOW AND STEADY WINS THE RACE
          <br/>
          By: Ram
          <br/>
          The famous saying, ‘Slow and steady wins the race’ emphasizes the problems one is likely to face due to unnecessary hurry. This hastiness is the cause of stress that hurts children and adults alike and is crippling our society in many ways, even causing death.
          <br/>
          A person who is consistent and steady in his approach can achieve success even if he is slow because his steps are measured, like the tortoise in the famous ‘tortoise and hare story’ in which the tortoise won the race because of his tireless efforts. But the concept of life being a race is flawed, because as soon as one thinks of it in such terms he gets into an excited state of agitation. Our life is not a race which can be won through our hastiness. It is a fascinating journey wherein measured steps and a systematic approach can enable us to achieve our goals.
         </p>
         <p>
          Success is very much an achievable target if we view things with confidence; without giving up when things do not seem to fall in place and being patient when it is taking time to reach our expected destination. We may often come across a person who, despite his exceptional talent fails, while another person with ordinary merit succeeds. The difference lies in the way these two people have worked. The one who worked hastily failed and the one who worked steadily and consistently became successful. When we are in an unnecessary hurry, our chances for making mistakes and errors increase because in our hastiness we may have to compromise on the quality of work. Let us always remember there is no shortcut for success and there is no alternative for hard work.

          BOOK EXHIBITION
          <br/>
          By: Rohini
          <br/>
          The Book Trust of India successfully organized a three day Book Exhibition in our neighbourhood, in the Raja Garden grounds. Many reputed national and international publishers participated in this event. This fair was inaugurated by the Vice Chancellor of Indira Gandhi National Open University, Professor Kumar. He appreciated all the arrangements made at the book fair and also visited many stalls and thanked the publishers for making the book fair such a success. Many people enthusiastically visited the book fair as”it housed a good collection of academic, fiction, research and general books. This book fair is likely to play a pivotal role in reiterating the importance of books and is likely to be recognized as a huge annual cultural event of book bonanza keenly awaited by students, teachers, scholars, intellectuals, authors and book lovers.

          Question 7.
          <br/>
          (a) Why are the young trees described as ‘sprinting’ in the poem ‘My Mother at Sixty-six?
          <br/>
          (b) What will keeping still help us achieve? (Keeping Quiet)
          <br/>
          (c) What changes did the order from Berlin cause on the day of the last lesson?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) The young trees are ‘sprinting’ that is rushing past the poet as she is travelling in a very fast-moving car. While travelling in a speeding vehicle, the objects outside appear to be rushing past us in the opposite direction. These sprinting trees are in stark contrast to the passive old lady sitting inside the car.

          Question 5.
          <br/>
          You are Ram/Rajani, an academic counsellor. You have been invited to speak on ‘Reading Makes a Ready Man’. Prepare’a’ speech in 150-200 words, giving your views on reading and pointing out how reading improves our knowledge, promotes thinking and develops our emotional health, thereby promoting peace and prosperity in life. [10]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          I would like to start my talk with a quote by the famous philosopher and author, Sir Francis Bacon ‘Reading Maketh a full Man./ because reading not only improves our knowledge and promotes thinking but it also develops our emotional health, thereby promoting peace and prosperity in life.
          <br/>
          Good Morning everyone!, I, Rajani am an academic counsellor and I have been invited to speak on ‘Reading Makes a Ready Man’. Reading is the best form of self-education and there is no limit to how much one can learn from sensible reading. Besides being an excellent way of passing our time, reading gives us a welcome break from our sometimes mundane and repetitive lives. Choose from a wide variety of written material to suit your personal preference and you will see it is a great way to feed your mind and spirit.
          <br/>
          The human mind is a continuous processing machine, that is always seeking information, and reading is the most apt way to nourish and stimulate our mind and keep it engaged constructively, which in turn will keep it away from negative thinking. Reading also helps to keep our mental faculties sharp and intact and it gives the mind a mental workout that does not let our mind become stale and dormant. As Mark Twain said: ‘The man who does not read has no advantage over the man who cannot read’. Reading is a form of relaxation that also develops our emotional well-being by enabling us to explore and delve into new avenues. Although the benefits of reading are numerous and priceless it is important that we read only that which does not damage our mind and keeps us away from negativity. I would like to conclude with a quote by Rachel Ander. ‘The journey of a lifetime starts with the turning of a page’.

          Write a debate either for or against the motion: Laziness and not bad luck is the only obstacle in one’s success in life. (150-200 words)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          When we curse our luck when, things have not turned out the way we expected them to or when we give unnecessary explanations as to why we could not do something are actually subtle signs of laziness that have prevented us from completing our task.
          <br/>
          Good Morning everyone! I…., have come before you all to speak in favour of the motion: ‘Laziness and not bad luck is the only obstacle to one’s success in life.’ The only silver lining in this cloud of laziness is that it is not a personality disorder, it is just a habit and can be broken. It is also not something we are born with, it is a bahaviour we have acquired along the way. But just as we learn to be lazy we can also teach ourselves to be industrious and then we will never feel the need to curse our luck each time we fail.
         </p>
         <p>
          Laziness is a major obstacle in one’s success so what we need to do is to project ourselves as being productive. We must make sure to include in our visualization the positive feeling that results from being productive. Changing the habit of laziness will require a lot of effort and mental toughness but when we understand that this habit, which is a major obstacle to our success in life, is self-imposed and we always have the choice to overcome it, we are sure to rise above it.
          <br/>
          We must always remember the only difference between being lazy and working hard is similar to the difference between expecting and creating miracles. Hard work is our protection and shield against bad luck.
          <br/>
          Thank you!

          Question 6.
          <br/>
          You are Ram/Rajani. You feel that in India, with its rich and varied heritage, linguistic and cultural diversity is essential to live in harmony which alone will lead to prosperity and peace. Write an article on the topic ‘Unity in Diversity’, in 150-200 xvords, specifying the advantages of unity and how we can promote it in spite of our diversity in religion, culture and language. You may quote relevant examples.[10]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          UNITY IN DIVERSITY
          <br/>
          By: Ram
          <br/>
          India has a rich and varied heritage with linguistic and cultural diversity. So to live in peace and harmony it is essential to be united despite the differences in our culture, caste or religion. We need to stay joined by only one faith and that is brotherhood.
          <br/>
          The good thing about our country and its culture is that it is tolerant and absorbing. The democratic set-up facilitates the process of promoting unity. The diversity in every religion or culture should therefore serve as a source of strength. We need to be proud of our cultural distinctiveness. Though our religions are different, their basic teachings are the same, belief in the theory of Dharma and Karma.
          <br/>
          To promote unity in our diverse country we need to think beyond petty interests and must work for broader goals to bring about prosperity and progress in our society. Our social and cultural differences should not be looked upon as conflicts but as varieties that enrich our society and our nation as a whole. We celebrate various festivals with a sense of unity, especially in schools and colleges. We display a great sense of unity when there is a foreign invasion challenge. The social customs and traditions which all Indians observe, irrespective of their caste and religion in different parts of our country, bring a sense of unity which keeps alive the message of being united despite our diversity.

          You are Ram/Rajani. You are concerned about the growing problem of obesity in children which leads to type II diabetes. Write an article in 150-200 words titled ‘Health, the best Wealth/ throwing light on what problems arise if we eat junk food or overeat and neglect our health, and how we can maintain good health through right food and good habits.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          HEALTH, THE BEST WEALTH
          <br/>
          By: Rajani
          <br/>
          ‘Health is Wealth’, is an old saying which aptly sums up the importance of maintaining good health. If we are healthy we are physically and mentally contented as we are away from medical conditions like hypertension, diabetes, heart ailments etc.
          <br/>
          In the past decade there has been an unprecedented rise in the growing problem of obesity in children, which is leading to type II diabetes. Children especially in the cities, binge on junk food or overeat, have sugar-sweetened beverages and include very few fruits and vegetables in their normal diet. As a result they become over-weight and obese and make themselves vulnerable to lifestyle diseases like high blood pressure and type II diabetes.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is imperative to ensure that children maintain a healthy lifestyle through right food and good eating habits. They should be encouraged to eat foods that provide adequate nutrition and provide an appropriate number of calories. Parents should look for ways to make their favourite dishes healthier and ensure that their children eat calorie-rich food in moderation. Children should be encourage to adopt an active lifestyle where they engage in some sort of physical activity daily. It is recommended to focus on small but permanent changes in the children’s eating pattern than a series of short-term changes which cannot be sustairted for long.
          <br/>
          To effectively address the complex problem of childhood obesity a sustained effort to promote a healthy lifestyle needs to be followed by parents and these strategies need to be initiated in children at a very early stage.

          Question 8.
          <br/>
          (d) How are Jack’s views on life different from those of Jo?
          <br/>
          (e) Why did Dr. Sadao’s servants leave his service?
          <br/>
          (f) How did the Tiger King die? Did the astrologer’s prediction come true?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (d) Jo is a child and her views on life are rather different from those of her father. She lives in a make-believe world where beauty and friendship are the supreme rulers, unlike Jack, who is an adult, and has a mature perspective and can see beyond the superficial aspect of a situation.
         </p>
         <p>
          japan was at war with America. Dr. Sadao was nursing a wounded american soldier . servants thought he was doing a treacherous act by helping the enemy . they thought he was doing a treacherous act by helping the enemy .
         </p>
         <p>
          a sliver of wood pierced the tiger king’s hand and he neglected his injury which became grievous and eventually led to his death . in a way the astrologer’s prediction did come true as the hundredth tiger was responsible for the king’s death .
