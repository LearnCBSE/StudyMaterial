          Question 5.
          <br/>
          Answer the following questions briefly:
          <br/>
          (a) Why does Jeanne want to buy a villa?
          <br/>
          (b) Why is Gaston not interested in buying the villa in the beginning?
          <br/>
          (c) Mrs. A1 Smith makes many statements about the French. Pick out any two and explain them.
          <br/>
          (d) Juliette says “ now I have only one thought that is to get the wretched place off my hands. I would sacrifice it at any price.” Does she stick to her words? Why/ Why not?
          <br/>
          (e) Who is better in business—Juliette or Gaston? Why?
          <br/>
          (f) Do you like/dislike Gaston? Give your reasons.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Jeanne wants to buy a villa for her old parents.
         </p>
         <p>
          (b) Gaston is not interested in buying the villa in the beginning. He is very clear that his wife Jeanne is not buying the villa for themselves. She wants to put her father and mother in it. Her parents would take possession of it every year from April to September. They would also bring all her sister’s children with them. Therefore, he starts finding fault with the villa and its excessive price.
         </p>
         <p>
          (c) Mrs. A1 Smith makes many statements about the French. She asks Gaston to consult his wife before making a deal. Gaston replies that he need not consult her. Mrs. A1 Smith considers Gaston an ‘exception’. She comments, “Frenchmen usually have to consult about ten people before they get a move on.” Her next comment is that “the French think about the past all the time while Americans always think about the future. She also mocks at the funny way of the Frenchmen while doing business deals.
         </p>
         <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
         </div>
         <p>
          (d) Juliette tells her maid that she wants “of get the wretched place off’ her hands. She is ready to sacrifice it at any price. But she doesn’t stick to her words. She demands two hundred and fifty thousand francs. Gaston finds it “decidedly excessive”. Then she tells him that she can’t let it go for less than two hundred thousand francs. She is interested in making a bargain. She accepts two hundred thousand francs when the final deal is made.
         </p>
         <p>
          (e) Gaston is definitely better in business. Juliette is also a hard bargainer. She pretends that she is going to sell the wretched place at any price. But she makes a bargain at two hundred thousand francs. She thinks that she is outsmarting Gaston. But Gaston proves more than her. He outsmarts both—Juliette and Mrs. A1 Smith. He buys the house in two hundred thousand and sells it for three thousands francs to Mrs. A1 Smith. In the bargain he saves a cool hundred thousand francs.
         </p>
         <p>
          (f) It is rather difficult to dislike Gaston. He is a man of this world with the vices and virtues of a worldly-wise businessman. He is not interested in buying the villa : He knows that his wife is simply trying to put up her father and mother in it. What is more, all the children of his wife’s sister will live with them. However, he changes his stand in the end. He realises that he can earn one hundred thousand francs by outwitting both Mrs. A1 Smith and Juliette.

          Question 9.
          <br/>
          You are Jeanne. After coming home you realise that the villa was not actually bought and your husband has fooled both you and the landlady of the villa. You are filled with rage, disgust and helplessness because of your husband’s betrayal. Write your feelings in the form of a diary entry.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Nogent-sur-Mame. 20th July, 20XX.
          <br/>
          All my dreams have ended in smoke. My husband, Mr. Gaston, has fooled both of us, me and the landlady of the villa. It is too much. There’s a limit to everything. Mr. Gaston’s main concern is money. He knows it that I wanted to buy the villa not only for ourselves but also for my parents. The cunning Mr. Gaston went on finding faults with the villa only not to buy it. Then suddenly comes the change. I was surprised how he got ready to buy the villa in two hundred thousand. He had rejected it just a while ago. He was not ready to pay more than sixty thousand. I was oveijoyed when he finally made the deal. I thought that the villa had been bought for us and my parents. Little did I know that Mr. Gaston was befooling all, myself, Juliette and Mrs. A1 Smith. He had earned a neat one hundred thousand francs in the …bargain. But I have lost both—the villa and my husband’s confidence.

          <br/>
          Question 1.
          <br/>
          Not at all. Mind you, if someone had bought it on the very day I placed it for safe, then I might have felt sorry because I would have wondered if I hadn’t been a fool to sell it at all. But the sign has been hanging on the gate for over a month now and I am beginning to be afraid that the day I bought it was when I was the real fool.” (Page 96)
          <br/>
          (a) How would the speaker have felt if someone had bought the villa on the very day she placed it for sale?
          <br/>
          (b) What has been hanging on the gate for over a month now?

         <p>
          Question 2.
          <br/>
          For the first week, I was annoyed every time I passed that ‘Villa for Sale’ sign. The neighbours
          <br/>
          seemed to look at me in such a strange kind of way that I began to think the whole thing was going to be much more of a sell than a sale. (Page 96)
          <br/>
          (a) Why was the speaker annoyed?
          <br/>
          (b) How did the whole thing become a ‘sell’ than a sale?
          <br/>
          (c) Name the speaker and the play from which these lines have been taken.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>

          <br/>
          (b) Juliette had waited for a long time but couldn’t find a suitable buyer for her villa. The whole thing became quite distressing and disappointing rather than a sale.
          <br/>
          (c) Juliette, the owner of the villa is the speaker and these lines have been taken from Sacha Guitry’s play ‘Villa for Sale’.
         </p>
         <p>
          Question 3.
          <br/>
          That was a month ago and now I have only one thought, that is to get the wretched place off
          <br/>
          my hands. I would sacrifice it at any price. One hundred thousand francs if necessary and that’s only twice what it cost me. (Page 96)
          <br/>
          (a) What does the speaker think about the villa?
          <br/>
          (b) Whatis she ready for?

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>

          <br/>
          (b) She is ready to sacrifice or get the villa offher hands at any price.
          <br/>
          (c) No, Juliette is a perfect saleswoman. Even the lowest price she may demand (one hundred thousand francs) is only twice what it cost her.
         </p>
         <p>
          Question 4.
          <br/>
          Oh! I’m fed up with the place. Because nobody really wants it! What time did those agency
          <br/>
          people say the lady would call? (Page 96)
          <br/>
          (a) Who was fed up with the place and why?
          <br/>
          (b) Who was coming and what was her objective of coming there?
          <br/>

          <br/>
          (c) No, the speaker, Juliette was only pretending to sacrifice her villa at any price. She wanted not even a franc less than two hundred thousand, twice the actual cost of the villa.

          <br/>
          “They might take you on for eight days, Madame. That would mean eight hundred francs. It’s really money for nothing. You would have to peel potatoes one minute and make an omlette the next, quite easy.” (Page 97)

          Question 11.

          Gaston did not want to spend money on a villa that would later be utilized more by his wife’s parents and her sister’s children. He quoted only three thousand francs for the villa with an expectation that the owner would refuse to sell off the villa at such a low price and he then would not be forced by his wife any longer.

This set her thinking that the task of selling the villa may not be a profitable proposal. Rather it may prove to be a great disappointment.

          I do agree that Mrs. Al Smith is the representative of American outlook. She is always complaining that the French people have a queer way of doing business. They usually consult ten people before they decide on anything. She takes pride in saying that the Americans only think about the future whereas the French stick to the past. Thus she is proud of her culture and critical of the French. She also believes that Frenchmen are apprehensive and backward looking. She is not justified in her opinion. Gaston proves that he is a shrewd businessman who can outsmart any American.

          Being an American filmmaker, Mrs. A1 Smith wanted a place near Paramount where she was going to shoot some films. She wanted to knock the villa down and build a bungalow in its place. So, she wasn’t interested in going over the house. Moreover, she trusts and believes others easily. She does not care to examine and analyse Others when she presumes that Gaston is the owner of the villa, she asks him the price of the villa and gives him a Cheque for the amount and leaves the place in a hurry.

          julitte had thought of giving away the villa at only double the price she had bought it But later she changed her mind on seeing Gaston and Jeanne  and quoted a price really higher then its actual worth. Gaston too was not interested in buying the villa but eventually changed his mind on meeting Mrs. Al Smith. Juliette didn’t harm as she did business ethically. On the contrary, Gaston was unethical, manipulative, unscrupulous and opportunistic. He first rolls in his villainy and never bothers about social or moral values.Thus,Gaston should have possessed moral standards, righteousness and truth.

          Dear Father,
          <br/>
          I am thrilled today as I have struck upon a deal in which I have made a huge profit.
          <br/>
          Jeanne had a craze for a villa. I was not keen on buying one, so only went to have a look for Jeanne’s satisfaction. Juliette, the owner of the villa, demanded two hundred thousand francs which I felt was quite high. When Jeanne had gone upstairs to see the villa, I came across Mrs. Al Smith, who was keen to buy the villa for three hundred thousand francs. 1 realized it was a good opportunity to make a profit. So, I pretended to be the owner of the house and struck a good deal with Mrs. Al Smith making a profit of hundred thousand francs, i am sure you would appreciate my presence of mind. See you soon.
          <br/>
          Yours affectionately,
          <br/>

          Dear Diary,
          <br/>
          Jeanne’s craze for a villa led Us to Juliett’s villa. I was uninterested in buying the villa but went there to have a look for Jeanne’s satisfaction. When the ladies went for an inspection of the villa, there was an entry of Mrs. Al Smith. She was in a great hurry and hence, mistook me to be the owner of the villa. Taking advantage of the situation, 1 got her to make a deal, thereby earning a profit of a hundred thousand francs. My wife was pleasantly surprised when I finalized the deal with Juliette. Although I am happy to strike this deal, at the same time I regret cheating my wife, Jeanne. She does not suspect my actions. Tomorrow, I shall tell her the reality. Hope she too will excuse me this time. I pledge not to cheat her again in the future. It was immoral and unethical to indulge in such an act. I shouldn’t have betrayed her confidence. I shall apologise to her, first thing in the morning.
          <br/>
          Thank you diary.

          Dear Juliette,
          <br/>
          I am greatly disheartened and shocked by the unprincipled behaviour of my husband. He has showed his true colours of cleverness. He has proved himself to be shrewd, calculating, business-minded and opportunistic. Initially, he was unwilling to buy the villa for he feared that the villa would be occupied by my parents and sister’s children. Later I was shocked when I came to know the truth that he has cheated both you and me. He has made a handsome profit out of the deal.
          <br/>
          f am shocked to realize that my feelings are not important to him. I have lost trust in my husband and want to teach him a lesson. I request you to kindly cancel the deal with Gaston and sign a fresh deal with Mrs. Al Smith. Thanks.
          <br/>
          Yours truly

          I am full of disgust after being cheated by Gaston today. I am disheartened to learn that I have been fooled by him. It was very selfish of him to say that he was buying toe villa for my parents, hater, I was shocked when I came to know the truth. He has cheated both Juliette mid myself. Now, 1 understand why he was in such a hurry to buy toe villa. He has proved himself to be very practical and money minded. How could he be so uncaring of my feelings? I am feeling very depressed and curse the day when I got married to him. His behaviour has lately been very unprincipled and unscrupulous, I wish Gaston would have behaved better I feel so helpless because of his betrayal I have decided I shall not talk to him. .

          Jeanne wanted the villa for her parents and her sister’s children. Gaston was not at all enthralled on account of it and found fault in the villa and said that the price was too high for the purchase. Juliette, the owner of the villa offered two hundred thousand francs while Mrs. Al Smith was ready to buy it for three hundred thousand francs. As Mr. Gaston was mistaken for the owner, he struck the deal iii order to make money. Gaston is an opportunist. He was clever and hypocritical. He could turn any situation to his advantage. He had great presence of mind and insight into Mrs. Al Smith’s psychology,

          Gaston was not a cheater, but a shrewd businessman. He had a strong business instinct. Seeing Mrs. Al Smith, he sensed profit. He showed presence of mind by posing as the owner of the villa and selling it for three hundred thousand francs. He then bought the villa for two hundred thousand francs, thereby making a clear and effortless profit of one hundred thousand francs.
