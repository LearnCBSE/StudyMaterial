           Important Questions of Metals and Non-Metals Class 10 Science Chapter 3
          </h2>
          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Reverse of the following chemical reaction is not possible:
           <br/>
           Zn
           <sub>
            (s)
           </sub>
           + CuSO
           <sub>
            4(aq)
           </sub>
           â†’ ZnSO
           <sub>
            4(aq)
           </sub>
           + Cu
           <sub>
            (s)
           </sub>
           <br/>
           Justify this statement with reason. (Board Term I, 2016)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           If a strip of zinc metal is put in copper sulphate solution, then the blue colour of copper sulphate fades gradually due to the formation of colourless zinc sulphate solution and reddish-brown copper metal is deposited on zinc strip.
           <br/>
           <img alt="Metals and Non-Metals Chapter Wise Important Questions Class 10 Science Img 1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-146168" height="69" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Metals-and-Non-Metals-Chapter-Wise-Important-Questions-Class-10-Science-Img-1.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Metals-and-Non-Metals-Chapter-Wise-Important-Questions-Class-10-Science-Img-1.png 414w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Metals-and-Non-Metals-Chapter-Wise-Important-Questions-Class-10-Science-Img-1-300x50.png 300w" width="414"/>
          </p>
          <p>
           In this reaction, zinc metal being more reactive than copper displaces copper from copper sulphate solution. If however, a strip of copper metal is placed in zinc sulphate solution, then no reaction occurs. This is because copper metal is less reactive than zinc metal and hence, cannot displace zinc from its salt solution.

          <p>
           Question 6.
           <br/>
           Give reason for the following:
           <br/>
           (i) Hydrogen gas is not evolved when most of the metals react with nitric acid.
           <br/>
           (ii) Zinc oxide is considered as an amphoteric oxide.
           <br/>
           (iii) Metals conduct electricity. (Board Term I, 2016)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Hydrogen gas is not evolved when most metals react with nitric acid. It is because HNO
           <sub>
            3
           </sub>
           is a strong oxidising agent. It oxidises the H
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           produced to water and itself gets reduced to any of the nitrogen oxides (N
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           O, NO, NO
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           ).
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) ZnO reacts both with acids as well as bases to form salt and water. Thus, ZnO is an amphoteric oxide.

          </div>
          <p>
           (iii) Metals conduct electricity due to the flow of free electrons present in them.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 7.
           <br/>
           (a) Why does calcium start floating when it reacts with water? Write the balanced chemical equation of the reaction.
           <br/>
           (b) Name two metals which do not react with water. (Board Term I, 2015)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Calcium reacts with cold water to form calcium hydroxide and hydrogen gas.
           <br/>
           <img alt="Metals and Non-Metals Chapter Wise Important Questions Class 10 Science Img 6" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-146173" height="38" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Metals-and-Non-Metals-Chapter-Wise-Important-Questions-Class-10-Science-Img-6.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Metals-and-Non-Metals-Chapter-Wise-Important-Questions-Class-10-Science-Img-6.png 384w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Metals-and-Non-Metals-Chapter-Wise-Important-Questions-Class-10-Science-Img-6-300x30.png 300w" width="384"/>
           <br/>
           The bubbles of hydrogen gas produced stick to the surface of calcium and hence, it starts floating on the surface of water.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Gold and silver do not react with water.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 8.
           <br/>
           State what would happen if:
           <br/>
           (i) some zinc pieces are placed in blue copper sulphate solution.
           <br/>
           (ii) someâ€™copper pieces are placed in green ferrous sulphate solution.
           <br/>
           (iii) an iron nail is dipped in a solution of copper sulphate for some time. (Board Term I, 2014)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Refer to answer 1.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Cu + FeSO
           <sub>
            4
           </sub>
           No Reaction
           <br/>
           Cu is less reactive than Fe, thus, it cannot displace Fe from FeSO
           <sub>
            4
           </sub>
           solution.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>

           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Give reason:
           <br/>
           (a) Aluminium is a reactive metal but is still used for packing food articles.
           <br/>
           (b) Calcium starts floating when water is added to it. (Board Term I, 2014)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Aluminium is a strong and cheap metal. It is also a good conductor of heat. But it is highly reactive. When it is exposed to moist air, its surface is covered with a thin impervious layer of aluminium oxide (Al
           <sub>
            2

           O
           <sub>
            3
           </sub>
           ). This layer does not allow moist air to come in contact with the fresh metal and hence, protects the metal underneath from further damage or corrosion. Thus, after the formation of this protective layer of Al

           O
           <sub>
            3
           </sub>
           , aluminium becomes resistant to corrosion. It is because of this reason that although aluminium is a highly reactive metal, it is still used in food packaging.

           Question 11.
           <br/>
           A metal â€˜Xâ€™ combines with a non-metal â€˜Yâ€™ by the transfer of electrons to form a compound Z.
           <br/>
           (i) State the type of bond in compound Z.
           <br/>
           (ii) What can you say about the melting point and boiling point of compound Z?
           <br/>
           (iii) Will this compound dissolve in kerosene or petrol?
           <br/>
           (iv) Will this compound be a good conductor of electricity? (Board Term I, 2017)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           X being a metal loses electrons and Y being a non-metal gains electrons to form Z.
           <br/>
           (i) The chemical bond formed by the transfer of electrons from one atom to another is known as an ionic bond. Hence, Z is an ionic compound.
           <br/>
           (ii) Compound Z is an ionic compound thus, it has high melting and boiling points.
           <br/>
           (iii) Ionic compounds are insoluble in non-polar solvents such as kerosene or petrol.
           <br/>
           (iv) As Z is an ionic compound, it does not conduct electricity in the solid state because movement of ions in the solid is not possible due to their rigid structure. But it conducts electricity in the molten state or in aqueous solution due to the movement of ions freely.

           An ore on treatment with dilute hydrochloric acid produces brisk effervescence. Name the type of ore with one example. What steps will be required to obtain metal from the enriched ore? Also write the chemical equations for the reactions involved in the process. (AI 2019)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The ore on treatment with dilute hydrochloric acid produces brisk effervescence hence, it must be a carbonate ore. Calamine (ZnCO
           <sub>
            3

           ) is an important carbonate ore of zinc.
           <br/>
           Steps required to obtain metal from the enriched carbonate Are:
           <br/>
           (a) Conversion of the carbonate ore into metal oxide : This is done by calcination (for carbonate ores).
           <br/>
           Calcination is the process of heating the ore strongly in the absence or limited supply of air. The zinc carbonate on heating decomposes to form zinc oxide as shown :
           <br/>

          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Reduction of the metal oxide to metal : As zinc is moderately reactive, zinc oxide cannot be reduced by heating alone. Hence, it is reduced to zinc by using a reducing agent such as carbon.

           Question 18.
           <br/>
           Carbon cannot reduce the oxides of sodium, magnesium and aluminium to their respective metals. Why? Where are these metals placed in the reactivity series? How are these metals obtained form their ores? Take an example to explain the process of extraction along with chemical equations. (2020)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Sodium, magnesium and aluminium have higher affinity towards oxygen than that of carbon because these are highly reactive metals. Hence, carbon cannot reduce the oxides of sodium, magnesium and aluminium to their respective metals. These metals are placed at the top of the reactivity series. The highly reactive metals like Na, Mg, Al, etc. are extracted by electrolytic reduction of their molten chlorides or oxides. Electrolytic reduction is brought about by passing electric current through the molten state. Metal gets deposited at the cathode.

           Electrolytic refining of crude copper :
           <br/>
           Thick block of impure metal acts as anode and a thin strip of pure copper metal acts as cathode. The electrolyse used is aqueous solution of copper sulphate containing a small amount of sulphuric acid. On passing electric current through the electrolyte, the metal from the anode dissolves into the electrolyte. An equivalent amount of copper metal from copper sulphate solution gets deposited on cathode.

           Question 29.
           <br/>
           Describe an activity to find out the conditions under which iron rusts. (Board Term I, 2017)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Activity:
           <br/>
           (i) Take three test tubes and put clean nails in each of the three tubes. Label them as A, B and C.
           <br/>
           (ii) Pour some water in test tube A and cork it.
           <br/>
           (iii) In tube B, pour some boiled distilled water along with some turpentine oil and cork it.
           <br/>
           (iv) In test tube C, add some anhydrous calcium chloride and cork it.
           <br/>
           (v) Look these test tubes properly and keep them undisturbed for a few days.
          </p>
          <p>
           Observation : Only in test tube A, iron nails get rusted since the nails in this test tube are exposed to both air and water.
           <br/>
           Conclusion : Both air and water are required for rusting of iron.

           Question 30.
           <br/>
           Why some metal surfaces acquire a dull appearance when they are exposed to moist air? Write colour acquired by the surfaces of copper and silver in such situation and also write the chemical names of the substances due to which it happens. (Board Term I, 2016)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When a metal has been kept exposed to air for a long time, then it gets a dull appearance. The metals lose their shine or brightness due to the formation of a thin layer of oxide, carbonate or sulphide on their surface and thus, the metal surface gets corroded. The surface of copper gets coated with a green layer in moist air due to the formation of basic copper carbonate, silver articles acquire a blackish tinge due to the formation of silver sulphide.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 31.

           <br/>
           (iii) Metal that exists in liquid state at room temperature
           <br/>
           (iv) Most malleable and ductile metal
           <br/>
           (v) Metal that is best conductor of electricity
           <br/>
           (vi) Non-metal that can exist in different forms
           <br/>
           (b) How are alloys better than metals? Give composition of solder and amalgam.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) (i) Sodium
           <br/>
           (ii) Iodine
           <br/>
           (iii) Mercury

           (iv) Gold
           <br/>
           (v) Silver
           <br/>
           (vi) Carbon
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Alloys are stronger than the metals from which they are made, more resistant to corrosion, have lower melting point, have lower electrical conductivity. Solder is an alloy of lead and tin. An amalgam is an alloy of mercury with another metal.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 32.
           <br/>
           (a) Define corrosion.
           <br/>
           (b) What is corrosion of iron called?
           <br/>
           (c) How will you recognise the corrosion of silver?
           <br/>
           (d) Why corrosion of iron is a serious problem?
           <br/>
           (e) How can we prevent corrosion of iron? (Board Term I, 2017)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The process of slowly eating up of metals due to their conversion into oxides, carbonates, sulphides, etc., by the action of atmospheric gases and moisture is called corrosion.
           <br/>
           (b) The corrosion of iron is called rusting.
           <br/>
           (c) Silver articles become black after sometime when exposed to air. This is due to formation of a coating of black silver sulphide (Ag
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           S) on its surface by the action of H
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           S gas present in the air.
           <br/>
           (d) Corrosion of iron is a serious problem. Every year large amount of money is spent to replace damaged iron articles. Corrosion causes damage to car bodies, bridges and iron railings, ships and to all objects made of metals specially those of iron.
           <br/>
           (e) Corrosion of iron is prevented by coating it with a layer of oil. The reason being that the layer of oil does not allow air and water to react the surface of iron. Corrosion of iron can also be prevented by painting, greasing, galvanising, anodising, electroplating or making alloys.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 33.
           <br/>
           Give reason for the following :
           <br/>
           (a) Ionic compounds have higher melting point and higher boiling point.
           <br/>
           (b) Sodium is kept immersed in kerosene.
           <br/>
           (c) Reaction of calcium with water is less violent.
           <br/>
           (d) Silver articles become black after some time when exposed to air.
           <br/>
           (e) Prior to reduction the metal sulphides and carbonates must be converted into metal oxides for extracting metals. (Board Term I, 2015)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Due to strong forces of attraction, the ions are bound to each other very firmly. As a result, the electrovalent or ionic solids have high melting and boiling points.
           <br/>
           (b) Refer to answer 23(b) (ii).
           <br/>
           (c) Calcium reacts with cold water but the reaction is less violent. The heat evolved is not sufficient for the hydrogen to catch fire.

           <br/>
           (d) Refer to answer 32(c).
           <br/>
           (e) The reduction of metal oxides to metal is easier than the reduction of metal sulphides and metal carbonates. Hence, these are first reduced to their corresponding metal oxides.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 34.
           <br/>
           (a) Metals like iron, silver and copper get corroded on exposure to air. Write the chemical name of the substance deposited on their surface respectively with itâ€™s colour, in each case.
           <br/>
           (b) List four ways by which rusting can be prevented. (Board Term I, 2013)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Iron gets corroded and forms ferric oxide which is rust, it is reddish brown in colour. For silver and copper, refer to answer 30.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) The various methods used for preventing the rusting of iron are given below:
           <br/>
           (i) By applying paint : Materials like railings, iron gates, iron bridges, bodies of cars, buses and trucks, etc. are all painted to protect them from rusting. Painting the metal surface does not allow them to come in contact with the moist air and thus, prevents rusting.
           <br/>
           (ii) Greasing and oiling : When some grease or oil is applied on the surface of an iron object, then moisture and air cannot come in contact with it and hence, rusting is prevented.
           <br/>
           (iii) Galvanization : It is a method of protecting iron from rusting by coating them with a thin layer of zinc. The iron coated with zinc is called galvanized iron.
           <br/>
           (iv) Electroplating : It is another technique used to prevent articles from rusting. In this process, metals like tin, nickel and chromium which do not corrode are electroplated on iron.

           <br/>
           (ii)From dilute hydrochloric acid, zinc can liberate hydrogen gas but copper cannot.
           <br/>
           (iii) Sulphide ore of a metal is first converted to its oxide to extract the metal from it.
           <br/>
           Answer.
           <br/>
           (i) It is because rubber is an insulator and does not allow current to flow through it.
           <br/>
           (ii) Zinc is more reactive than hydrogen. Therefore, it can displace hydrogen from dilute HCl whereas copper cannot, because it is less reactive than hydrogen. ,
           <br/>
           (iii) It is because it is easier to reduce oxide ore as compared to sulphide ore.

           68.(a) What is meant by corrosion? Name any two methods used for the prevention
           <br/>
           of corrosion.
           <br/>
           (b) Suppose you have to extract metal M from its enriched sulphide ore. If M is in the middle of the reactivity series, write various steps used in extracting this metal.
           <br/>
           Answer. (a) Corrosion is a process in which metal reacts with substances present in the environment to form surface compounds.
           <br/>
           Prevention:
           <br/>
           (i) Galvanisation is a process to prevent corrosion of iron.
           <br/>
           (ii)Electroplating is also used to prevent corrosion.
           <br/>
           (b)(i) Concentration of ores: Sulphide ore will be concentrated by froth- floatation process. Sulphide ore will be collected in froth whereas gangue will be left behind.
           <br/>
           (ii) Roasslng: Sulphide ore is heated strongly in the presence of O

           <br/>
           (iii) Reduction: MO reacts with carbon (acts as reducing agent) to form metal and CO.
           <br/>
           MO + C â€”-&gt; M + CO
           <br/>
           (iv) Electrolytic refining: Impure metal â€˜Mâ€™ is purified by electrolytic refining. Impure metal is taken as anode, pure metal is taken as cathode, soluble salt of metal is taken as electrolyte. Impure metal forms metal ions which gain electrons and form pure metal at cathode.
