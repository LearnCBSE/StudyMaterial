            “Dibya’ was the name given by Indrani Debi. It was a telescope. Dattada was always busy during night with Dibya. He never cared for his wife or about himself. So his wife disliked it as her rival.
           </li>
           <li>
            She complains that Dibya has cast a spell on her husband. But she could not help smiling at his childlike behaviour. He did not bother to close the door and he forgot to put on his sweater.

           </li>
           <li>
            A planet has a fixed orbit. A comet comes from the distant comers of the solar system. It keeps on changing.
           </li>
           <li>
            Duttada was hopeful of discovering a new comet because he knew that professional astronomers did not consider them significant and ignored them.
           </li>
           <li>
            The discovery of the new comet brought Duttada publicity which he did not like. He had to attend many receptions and functions. So he wished he hadn’t discov­ered that new comet.
           </li>

            The discovery of the new comet made Duttada’s wife unhappy. She was supersti­tious. She thought that the discovery would bring calamities on the family as well as on the earth.

           <br/>
           Duttada was an amateur astronomer. Star gazing was his hobby. But he had a scientific attitude. His secret ambition in life was to discover a comet or a shooting star. After his retirement he got the funds to buy a telescope and leisure enough to watch the stars. He named his eight-inch telescope
           <em>
            Dibya-chakshu
           </em>
           . He was successful in search. He discovered a comet heading towards the earth. It was called Dutta comet. The news spread world over. James Forsyth predicted that the comet would collide with the earth and destroy it. Dutta’s wife, Indrani Debi, was afraid that the comet would cause ruin. She arranged a Yajna to pacify the evil spirit behind the comet. But the world scientists prepared a plan to make a nuclear explosion and deflect the comet from its path. The operation was named Project Light Brigade. It was successful. The world was saved. But Indrani Debi gave all credit to the holy yajna she got performed.

           <br/>
           Duttada took up star gazing as a hobby. His secret ambition was to discover a new comet. He used a small telescope and discovered a comet heading towards the earth. James Forsyth calculated that the comet would hit the earth in ten months. Comet Dutta created a commotion and panic among the scientists. Sir John Macpherson prepared a secret plan to give a push to the deadly comet. It was called Project Light Brigade. The operation was successful and the disaster was averted. But Duttada’s wife attributed the safety of the earth to the yajna she had performed.

            Answer:

           <br/>
           Duttada was an amateur scientist. Star gazing was his hobby. His secret ambition was to discover a new comet. He pursued his hobby firmly. He discovered a comet, heading towards the earth. He knew it could hit and destroy the earth. But the crisis could be averted by exploding a nuclear payload near the comet. This was a sensible and scientific approach. But his wife Indrani Debi was a superstitious woman. She went by what the priests said. To avert the ill-effect of the discovery, she organised a
           <em>
            yajna

           <br/>
           James Forsyth predicted that the effect of the collision between the comet and the earth would be terrific. Their assessment was based on the calculations. The collision was unavoidable unless the comet split up near the sun and disappeared. Or it might collide with some other comet before reaching the earth. Otherwise, the comet would take ten months to hit the earth. These were the two rare circumstances.
