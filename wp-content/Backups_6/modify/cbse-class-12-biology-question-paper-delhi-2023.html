           Question 3.
           <br/>
           The decrease in the T-lymphocytes count in human blood will result in: [1]
           <br/>
           (a) Decrease in antigens
           <br/>
           (b) Decrease in antibodies
           <br/>
           (c) Increase in antibodies
           <br/>
           (d) Increase in antigens
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (b) Decrease in antibodies
          </p>
          <p>
           The B-lymphocytes produce an army of proteins in response to pathogens into our blood to fight with them. These proteins are called antibodies. The T-cells themselves do not secrete antibodies but help B cells to produce them. Hence, decreases in number of T- lymphocytes automatically reduce the count of antibodies.
          </p>
          <p>
           Note
           <br/>
           If you have low number of lymphocytes, you are at higher risk of infections.

           Question 5.
           <br/>
           A Tight one-to-one relationship between many species of fig tree and certain wasps is an example of – [1]
           <br/>
           (a) Commensalism
           <br/>
           (b) Parasitism
           <br/>
           (c) Amensalism
           <br/>
           (d) Mutualism
           <br/>
           Select the pathogen mismatched with the symptoms of disease caused by it from the list given below : [1]
           <br/>
           (a) Entamoeba histolytica : Constipation, abdominal pain.
           <br/>
           (b) Epidermophyton : Dry scaly lesions on nail.
           <br/>
           (c) Wuchereria bancrofti : Chronic inflammation of lymphatic vessels of lower limb.
           <br/>
           (d) Haemophilus influenzae : Blockage of the intestinal passage.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (d) The interaction confers benefits on both the interacting species. Such type of interaction is called Mutualism. One of the most common examples of mutualism is, the fèmale wasp uses the fruit not only as an oviposition (egg-laying) site hut uses the developing seeds within the fruit for nourishing its larvae. The wasp pollinates the fig inflorescence while searching for suitable egg-laying sites. In return for the favour of pollination the fig offers the wasp some of its developing seeds, as food for the developing wasp larvae.

           Assertion (A) : Determining the sex of an unborn child followed by MTP is an illegal practice.
           <br/>
           Reason (R) : Amniocentesis is a practice to test the presence of genetic disorders also. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (b) Both (A) and (R) are true, but (R) is not the correct explanation of (A).

          <p>
           Statutoryban on amniocentesis for sex-determination to legally check increasing menace of female foeticides, massive child immunisation, etc., are some programmes that have been mentioned in this connection. In aminocentesis some of the amniotic fluid of the developing foetus is taken to analyse the fetal cells and dissolved substances. This procedure is used to test for the presence of certain genetic disorders such as, Down syndrome, haemoplilia, sickle-cell anemia, etc. to determine the survivability of the foetus.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           (b) Both (A) and (R) are true, but (R) is not the correct explanation of (A).
          </p>
          <p>
           In polymerase chain reaction, multiple copies of the gene (or DNA) of interest is synthesised in vitro using two sets of primers (small chemically synthesised oligonucleotides that are complementary to the regions of DNA) and the enzyme DNA polymerase. The enzyme extends the primers using the nucleotides provided in the reaction and the genomic DNA as template.

           <br/>
           Assertion (A) : Decomposition process is slower if detritus is rich in lignin and chitin.
           <br/>
           Reason (R): Decomposition is largely an oxygen requiring process. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (b) Both (A) and (R) are true, but (R) is not the correct explanation of (A).
          </p>
          <p>
           Decomposition is largely an oxygen-requiring process. The rate of decomposition is controlled by chemical composition of detritus and climatic factors. In a particular climatic condition, decomposition rate is slower if detritus is rich in lignin and chitin, and quicker, if detritus is rich in nitrogen and water-soluble substances like sugars.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The plant Calotropis produces highly poisonous cardiac glycosides and that is why we never see any cattle browsing on this plant. A wide variety of chemical substances that we can extract from plants on a commercial scale (nicotine, caffeine, quinine, strychnine, opium, etc.,) are produced by them actually as defences against grazers and browsers.

           (a) (i) Nucleopolyhedrovirus are excellent candidates for species-specific, narrow spectrum insecticidal applications.
           <br/>
           (ii) Nucleopolyhedrovirus have been shown to have no negative impacts on plants, mammals, birds, and fish or even on non-target insects. This is especially desirable when beneficial insects are being conserved to aid in an overall integrated pest management (IPM) programme, or when an ecologically sensitive area is being treated.

           OR
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Benign tumors normally remain confined to their original location and do not spread to other parts of the body and cause little damage. The malignant tumors, on the other hand are a mass of proliferating cells called neoplastic or tumor cells. These cells grow very rapidly, invading and damaging the surrounding normal tissues. As these cells actively divide and grow they also starve the normal cells by competing for vital nutrients. Cells sloughed from such tumors reach distant sites through blood, and wherever they get lodged in the body, they start a new tumor there.

           <br/>
           Name and explain a surgical contraceptive method that can be adopted by the male partner of a couple. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Surgical methods, also called sterilisation, are generally advised for the male/female partner as a terminal method to prevent any more pregnancies. Surgical intervention blocks gamete transport and thereby prevents conception. Sterilisation procedure in the male is called ‘vasectomy’ and that in the female, tubectomy’.
           <br/>
           In vasectomy, a small part of the vas deferens is cut or tied up through a small incision on the scrotum.

           Question 24.
           <br/>
           Industrial melanism in England after 1850 is an excellent example of Natural selection. Explain how? [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In a collection of moths made in 1850s, i.e., before industrialisation set in, it was observed that there were more white-winged moths on trees than dark-winged or melanised moths. However, in the collection carried out from the same area, but after industrialisation, i.e., in 1920, there were more dark-winged moths in the same area, i.e., the proportion was reversed.
          </p>
          <p>
           The explanation put forth for this observation was that ‘predators will spot a moth against a contrasting background’. During post industrialisation period, the tree trunks became dark due to industrial smoke and soots. Under this condition the white-winged moth did not survived due to predators, dark-winged or melanised moth survived.
          </p>
          <p>
           Before industrialisation set in, thick growth of almost white- coloured lichen covered the trees – in that background the white winged moth survived but the dark-coloured moth were picked out by predators. They will not grow in areas that are polluted. Hence, moths that were able to camouflage themselves, i.e., hide in the background, survived. This understanding is supported by the fact that in areas where industrialisation did not occur e.g., in rural areas, the count of melanic moths was low. This showed that in a mixed population, those that can better- adapt, survive and increase in population size. Remember that no variant is completely wiped out.

           Question 25.
           <br/>
           One of the major approaches of crop improvement programme is Artificial Hybridisation. Explain the steps involved in making sure that only the desired pollen grain pollinate the stigma of a bisexual flower by a plant breeder. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Artificial hybridisation is one of the major approaches of crop improvement programme. In such crossing experiments it is important to make sure that only the desired pollen grains are used for pollination and the stigma is protected from contamination (from unwanted pollen). This is achieved by emasculation and bagging techniques. If the female parent bears bisexual flowers, removal of anthers from the flower bud before the anther dehisces using a pair of forceps is necessary. This step is referred to as emasculation.
          </p>
          <p>
           Emasculated flowers have to be covered with a bag of suitable size, generally made up of butter paper, to prevent contamination of its stigma with unwanted pollen. This process is called bagging. When the stigma of bagged flower attains receptivity, mature pollen grains collected from anthers of the male parent are dusted on the stigma, and the flowers are rebagged, and the fruits allowed to develop.

           Question 26.
           <br/>
           (a) “Plasmodium protozoan needs both a mosquito and a human host for its continuity.” Explain. [3]
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           (b) We all must work towards maintaining good health because ‘health is wealth’. Enlist any six ways of achieving good health. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) In the life cycle of Plasmodium, Plasmodium enters the human body as sporozoites (infectious form) through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquito. The parasites initially multiply within the liver cells and then attack the red blood cells (RBCs) resulting in their rupture. The rupture of RBCs is associated with release of a toxic substance, haemozoin, which is responsible for the chill and high fever recurring every three to four days.
          </p>
          <p>
           When a female Anopheles mosquito bites an infected person, these parasites enter the mosquito’s body and undergo further development. The parasites multiply within them to form sporozoites that are stored in their salivary glands. When these mosquitoes bite a human, the sporozoites are introduced into his/ her body, thereby initiating the events mentioned above. Hence, malarial parasite requires two hosts – human and mosquitoes – to complete its life cycle.
          </p>
          <p>
           Note
           <br/>
           Different species of plasmodium (P vivax, P malaria and P falciparum) are responsible for causing malaria.

           Question 27.
           <br/>
           On spraying Bacillus thuringiensis on an infected cotton crop field the pests are killed by the toxin, however the toxin although produced by the bacteria does not affect it. Explain giving reason. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Some strains of Bacillus thuringiensis produce proteins that kill certain insects such as lepidopterans (tobacco budworm, armyworm), coleopterans (beetles) and dipterans (flies, mosquitoes)
          </p>
          <p>
           B. thuringiensis forms protein crystals during a particular phase of their growth. These crystals contain a toxic insecticidal protein. The Bt toxin protein exist as inactive protoxins but once an insect ingest the inactive toxin, it is converted into an active form of toxin due to the alkaline pH of the gut which solubilise the crystals. The activated toxin binds to the surface of midgut epithelial cells and creates pores that cause cell swelling and lysis and eventually cause death of the insect.

           “Biodiversity plays a major role in many ecosystem services that nature provides.”
           <br/>
           (a) Describe any two broadly utilatarian arguments to justify the given statement.
           <br/>
           (b) State one ethical reason of conserving biodiversity. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The broadly utilitarian argument says that biodiversity plays a major role in many ecosystem services that nature provides.
           <br/>
           The two broadly utilitarian arguments are:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            The fast dwindling Amazon forest is estimated to produce, through photosynthesis, 20 per cent of the total oxygen in the earth’s atmosphere.
           </li>
           <li>
            Pollination (without which plants cannot give us fruits or seeds) is another service, ecosystems provide through pollinators layer – bees, bumblebees, birds and bats.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           (b) The ethical argument for conserving biodiversity relates to what we owe to millions of plant, animal and microbe species with whom we share this planet.
           <br/>
           Philosophically or spiritually, we need to realise that every species has an intrinsic value, even if it may not be of current or any economic value to us.

           Question 30.
           <br/>
           The chromosome number is fixed for all normal organisms leading to species specification whereas any abnormality in the chromosome number of the fixed number of chromosomes both in male and female. In male it is ’44 + XY’ and in female it is ’44 + XX’. Thus the human male is heterogametic, in other words produces two different types of gametes one with ’22 + X’ chromosomes and the other with ’22 + Y’ chromosomes respectively: Human female, on the other hand is homogametic i.e. produces only one type of gamete with ’22 + X’ chromosomes only. Sometimes an error may occur during meiosis of cell cycle, where the sister chromatids fail to segregate called nondisjunction, leading to the production of abnormal gametes with altered chromosome number. On fertilisation such gametes develop into abnormal individuals.

The nucleus of the functional megaspore divides mitotically to form two nuclei which move to the opposite poles, forming the 2-nucleate embryo sac.
          </p>
          <p>
           Two more sequential mitotic nuclear divisions result in the formation of the 4-nucleate and later the 8- nucleate stagesof the embryo sac. It is of interest to note that these mitotic divisions are strictly free nuclear, that is, nuclear divisions are not followed immediately by cell wall formation. After the 8- nucleate stage, cell walls are laid down leading to the organisation of the typical female gametophyte or embryo sac. Observe the distribution of cells inside the embryo sac. Six of the eight nuclei are surrounded by cell walls and organised into cells; the remaining two nuclei, called polar nuclei are situated below the egg apparatus in the large central cell.

           (i) After implantation, finger-like projections appear on the trophoblast called chorionic villi which are surrounded by the uterine tissue and maternal blood. The chorionic villi and uterine tissue become interdigitated with each other and jointly form a structural and functional unit between developing embryo (foetus) and maternal body called placenta. The placenta facilitates the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the embryo and also removal of carbon dioxide and excretory/waste materials produced by the embryo.
          </p>
          <p>
           The placenta is connected to the embryo through an umbilical cord which helps in the transport of substances to and from the embryo. Placenta also acts as an endocrine tissue and produces several hormones like human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), human placental lactogen (hPL), estrogens, progestagens, etc.

           Question 33.
           <br/>
           (a) Bioreactors are the containment vehicles of any biotechnology-based production process. For large scale production and for economic reasons the final success of biotechnological process depends on the efficiency of the bioreactor. [5]
           <br/>

           (ii) What are the protruding and hanging stretches of DNA produced by these restriction enzymes called? Describe their role in formation of r-DNA. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a)
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) The four operational guidelines that must be adhered to for achieving optimization of the bioreactor system:
          </p>
          <p>
           1. Monitoring and control of key parameters: In order to achieve optimal growth and productivity of the biological system, it is essential to monitor and control key parameters such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and nutrient levels. This can be achieved by using sensors and control systems that can adjust these parameters as needed.
          </p>
          <p>
           2. Optimization of mixing and aeration: Proper mixing and aeration are essential for ensuring uniform distribution of nutrients and oxygen to the biological system. The mixing and aeration rate should be optimized based on the specific requirements of the system, as well as the characteristics of the bioreactor being used.
          </p>
          <p>
           3. Minimizing contamination: Contamination can have a significant impact on the productivity of the biological system, so it is essential to minimize the risk of contamination by maintaining aseptic conditions throughout the process. This can be achieved by using sterile equipment, air filtration systems, and other appropriate measures.
          </p>
          <p>
           4. Maintenance and cleaning of the bioreactor: Regular maintenance and cleaning of the bioreactor are essential for ensuring optimal performance and longevity of the system. This includes routine inspection of the system, cleaning of all components, and replacement of any worn or damaged parts as needed.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The cells can also be multiplied in a continuous culture system wherein the used medium is drained out from one side while fresh medium is added from the other to maintain the cells in their physiologically most active log/exponential phase.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) After completion of the biosynthetic stage, the product has to be subjected through a series of processes before it is ready for marketing as a finished product. The processes include separation and purification, which are collectively referred to as downstream processing. The product has to be formulated with suitable preservatives. Such formulation has to undergo thorough clinical trials as in case of drugs. Strict quality control testing for each product is also required. The downstream processing and quality control testing vary from product to product.
          </p>
          <p>
           OR
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) (i)
           <br/>
           (I) EcoRI comes from Escherichia coli RY 13. In EcoRI, the letter ‘R’ is derived from the name of strain. Roman numbers following the names indicate the order in which the enzymes were isolated from that strain of bacteria.

           <br/>
           (ii) Restriction endonucleases are used in genetic engineering to form recombinant molecules of DNA,which are composed of DNA from different sources/Genomes. When cut by the same restriction enzyme, the resultant DNA fragments have the same kind of sticky-ends’ and these can be joined together (end-to-end) using DNA Ligases.
          </p>
          <p>
           (II) Restriction endonuclease Cut the strand of DNA a little away from the centre of the palindrome sites, but between the same two bases on the opposite strands. This leaves single stranded portions at the ends. There are overhanging stretches called sticky ends on each strand. These are named so because they form hydrogen bonds with their complementary cut counterparts. This stickiness of the ends facilitates the action of the enzyme DNA ligase.
          </p>
          <p>
           Note
           <br/>
           DNA ligase is a DNA-joining enzyme. In DNA cloning, restriction enzymes and DNA ligase are used to insert genes and other pieces of DNA into plasmids.
