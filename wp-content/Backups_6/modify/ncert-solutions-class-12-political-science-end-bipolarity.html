           </span>
           The three features that distinguish the Soviet economy from that of a capitalist country like the US, can be summed up as follows:
           <br/>
           1. Soviet economy experienced a complex communication network, vast energy resources and an efficient transport sector to connect its remotest areas.
           <br/>
           2. Soviet Union industries produced every domestic product from pin to cars, whose quality might not match with that of the west technology.
           <br/>
           3. Soviet Union ensured a minimum standard of living for all its citizens. Consequently Government subsidised basic necessities including health, education, children and other welfare schemes.
           <br/>
           4. There was an absence of unemployment in Soviet Union.
           <br/>
           5. Land and productive assets were owned by the state only.

            </strong>
           </span>
           Mikhail Gorbachev was the General Secretary of Communist Party of Soviet Union in 1985. He was forced to initiate the reforms in the USSR due to following reasons:
           <br/>

           </span>
           The major consequences of the disintegration of the Soviet Union for countries like India can be analysed as follows:
           <br/>
           1. Disintegration of Soviet Union gave an end to Cold War confrontations and to ideological disputes between two superpowers.
           <br/>
           2. Military alliances had been abolished and demand arose for world peace and security.
           <br/>
           3. Multipolar system was surpassed to exist where no single power could dominate and a group of countries could play a crucial role in world politics like NAM Countries.
           <br/>
           4. The US became the sole superpower and capitalist economy became dominant at international level. World Bank and IMF became powerful advisors due to their economic support to these countries during transitional period.
           <br/>
           5. The motion of liberal democracy emerged as a way to organise political life.
           <br/>
           6. Due to disintegration of Soviet Union many new countries emerged with the independent aspirations and choices.
           <br/>
           7. The Baltic and East European states wanted to join European Union and became the part of NATO. The Central Asian countries took the advantage of their geographical location and continued close ties with Russia, West, China and others.

             Answer:
            </strong>
           </span>
           Shock Therapy was a painful process of transition from an authoritarian socialist system to a democratic capitalist system. This transformation system was influenced by the world bank and the IMF in Russia, Central Asia and East Europe. Though it varies in intensity and speed amongst the former second world countries but its direction and features were quite similar.
           <br/>
           This was not the best way to make a transition from communism to capitalism due to following drawbacks:
           <br/>
           1. Russia, the large state controlled industrial complex lost about 90 per cent of its industries through sales to private individuals and companies
           <br/>
           2. It created “the largest garage sale in history” which led virtual disappearance of entire industries for the restructuring was carried out by market forces in place of government owned policies.
           <br/>
           Hence, industries were undervalued and sold at throwaway prices.
           <br/>
           3. It systematically destroyed old system of social welfare.
           <br/>
           4. The value of ‘ruble’, the Russian currency, declined dramatically due to high rate of inflation and real GDP of Russia also declined between 1989 to 1999.
           <br/>
           5. The withdrawal of government subsidies pushed large sections of society into poverty and it emerged mafia to start controlling many economic activities.
           <br/>
           6. Privatisation led to new disparities which divided Russia between rich and poor people creating economic inequality.
           <br/>
           7. Hence, Shock Therapy brought ruin to economies and disaster upon the people of entire region.

           India should not change its foreign policy and focus more on friendship with US, but India is required to maintain healthy relations with Russia because India has experienced a long band of mutual trust, interests and popular perceptions with Russia in the following manner:
           <br/>
           1. Russia and India share a vision of multipolar world order i.e. co¬existence of several world powers internationally, collective security, greater regionalism, democratisation with the decision-making through bodies like the UN.
           <br/>
           2. More than 80 bilateral agreements have been experienced between India and Russia as a part of the Indo- Russia Strategic Agreement of 2001.
           <br/>
           3. India has been benefitted from its relationship on the issues like Kashmir, energy supplies, sharing information on international terrorism, access to Central Asia and balancing its relation with China.
           <br/>
           4. Russia is also important for India’s nuclear energy plane and assisting India’s space industry by giving cryogenic rocket to India whenever needed.
           <br/>
           5. Co-operation with Russia and its republics like Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan in the form of partnership and investment in oil fields has also benefitted India.
           <br/>
           6. Russia is also benefitted from India on ground of the second largest arms market for Russia. Indian military gets most of its hardware from Russia.
           <br/>
           7. Russia and India have collaborated on various scientific projects also.

           The Soviet Union lagged behind the West in technology, infrastructure (transport, power etc.) as it could not cope with the political and economic aspirations of people and resulted in:
           <br/>
           1. Though wages continued to grow but productivity and technology fell considerably behind that of the West.
           <br/>
           2. This led to shortage of consumer goods and increased food import every year.
           <br/>
           3. The above mentioned reasons made the Soviet economy stagnant.

           Disintegration of the USSR gave birth to Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) when under the leadership of Boris Yeltsin Russia, Ukraine and Belarus declared themselves as independent and gave a surprise to other republics especially to central Asian Republics. This issue was resolved quickly by making these republics as founding

           </span>
           Soviet system became so weak and Soviet economy stagnant due to the following reasons:
           <br/>
           1. The Soviet economy used much of its resources in maintaining nuclear and military arsenals.
           <br/>
           2. Soviet economy concentrated on the development of its satellite states in Eastern Europe especially in the five central Asian Republics.
           <br/>
           3. This led to a huge economic burden on people to be coped up with.
           <br/>
           4. Ordinary citizens became more knowledgeable about the economic advancement of the West and backwardness of Soviet system.

           2. Some sections of Soviet Society felt that Gorbachev should have moved much faster and were disappointed and impatient with him.
           <br/>
           3. The members of communist party felt that their power and privileges were eroding and Gorbachev was moving too quickly.
           <br/>

           The Soviet system, however, became very bureaucratic and authoritarian, making life very difficult for its citizens. Lack of democracy and the absence of freedom of speech stifled people who often expressed their dissent in jokes and cartoons. Most of the institutions of the Soviet state needed reform : the one-party system
           <br/>
           represented by the communist party of the Soviet union had tight control over all institutions and was unaccountable to the people. The party refused to recognise the urge of people in the fifteen different republics that formed the Soviet Union to manage their own affairs including their cultural affairs. Although, on paper, Russia was only one of the fifteen republics then together constituted the USSR in reality Russia dominated everything, and people from other regions felt neglected and often suppressed.
