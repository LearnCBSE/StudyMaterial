           Define ignition temperature of a substance.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Ignition temperature is the lowest temperature at which a substance catches fire. Ignition temperature is different for different substances. For example; LPG, petrol, natural gas, etc. catch fire at very low temperature and thus have low ignition temperature, while wood, coal, etc. have high ignition temperature.

           What are fuels? Name any two common fuel.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A fuel is a very good source of heat. The heat energy produced by burning a fuel can be used directly to cook food, for running motor vehicles and factory machines, can be converted into electrical energy at thermal power stations. Wood and Petrol are examples of two common fuels.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 21 B.
           <br/>
           State any four characteristic of an ideal fuel(or good fuel).
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Characteristics of ideal fuel-
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            It has a high calorific value
           </li>
           <li>
            It burns easily in air at a moderate rate
           </li>
           <li>
            It has proper ignition temperature
           </li>
           <li>
            It does not produce any harmful gases or leaves any residue after burning.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           Question 22 A.
           <br/>
           Define the calorific value of a fuel.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The amount of heat produced by the complete burning or combustion of 1 Kilo gram of a fuel is called its calorific value. The calorific value of a fuel is expressed in the unit of Kilo joules per kilogram.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 22 B.
           <br/>
           “The calorific value of LPG is 55000 KJ/kg”. What does it mean?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The calorific value of LPG is 55000 KJ/Kg. It means when 1 Kg of LPG is burned completely, then 55000 KJ of heat energy is produced.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 23.
           <br/>
           Can you burn a piece of wood by bringing a lighted matchstick near it? Explain.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A matchstick can light a tiny splinter of wood but not a big log of wood. A splinter of wood has a low ignition temperature. A burning matchstick can produce sufficient heat to reach the ignition temperature of the splinter of wood therefore a matchstick can light a splinter of wood directly.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 24.

           Why do you have to use paper or kerosene oil to start fire in wood or coal?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The ignition temperature of wood or coal is very high, as it requires too much of time to get heated before burning. We use paper or kerosene to start fire because they have low ignition temperature which helps to catch fire immediately and helps the wood or the coal to reach its required ignition temperature.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Combustion is a chemical process in which a substance reacts with oxygen and gives out energy during the process in the form of either heat or light or both. Rusting of iron is an exothermic process as heat is released during rusting. Hence, it is a kind of slow combustion.

           Question 30.
           <br/>
           Why are fires produced by burning oil not extinguished by pouring water?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           As water is heavier than petrol therefore slips down permitting the petrol to rise to the surface and continue to burn. Besides, the existing temperature is so high that the water poured on the fire evaporates even before it can extinguisher the fire.
          </p>

           Question 31.
           <br/>
           Explain why, fire caused by electricity should not be extinguished by pouring water.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Water is conductive in nature and hence the electricity in the equipment could reach the extinguisher (the person dousing the fire using water) and can electrocute him/her.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 32.
           <br/>
           How is the fire caused by electricity extinguished?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           To put an electrical fire out, we need to unplug or de-energise the equipment on fire. That will eliminate the electricity that is causing the fire. If one cannot unplug what is burning there is a special type of fire extinguisher.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Carbon dioxide is the best fire extinguisher to put out fire caused by inflammable materials like oil and petrol and electrical equipments. Carbon dioxide is heavier than air and it covers the fire and cuts off the supply of oxygen and puts out the fire. Carbon dioxide is stored at high pressure as liquid in cylinders.

           Question 37.
           <br/>
           Explain why, we are advised not to sleep in a room having closed doors and windows, with a coal fire burning inside.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Due to the burning of coal, the available oxygen gets depleted and it leads to incomplete burning of coal. Incomplete combustion of coal gives carbon monoxide gas. It is a very poisonous gas. It is dangerous to burn coal in a closed room. The carbon monoxide gas produced can kill persons sleeping in that closed room

           Question 40.
           <br/>
           Explain how, carbon dioxide is able to control fires?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Carbon dioxide is the best fire extinguisher to put out fire caused by inflammable materials like oil and petrol and electrical equipments. Carbon dioxide is heavier than air and it covers the fire and cuts off the supply of oxygen and puts out the fire. Carbon dioxide is stored at high pressure as liquid in cylinders. When released from the cylinder, carbon dioxide expands enormously in volume and cools down. Carbon dioxide not only forms a blanket around the burning substance, it also cools down the burning substance.

           Question 41.
           <br/>
           If you see a person whose clothes are on fire, how will you extinguish the fire? Give reason for your Answer:.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           If the clothes of a person catch fire, the person should be immediately covered with a blanket. When the burning clothes of a person are covered with a blanket, the supply of air to the burning clothes is cut off and hence the burning stops.

           (a) partial combustion of fuel takes places, and
           <br/>
           (b) complete combustion of fuel takes place?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) In the middle zone partial combustion of the fuel takes place, so the colour of the flame is yellow and it is moderately hot part of the flame. It is the luminous part of the flame.
           <br/>
           (b) In the outer zone complete combustion of the fuel takes place, so colour of the flame is blue and it is the hottest part of the flame. It is the non luminous part of the flame.

           LPG is a better domestic fuel than wood.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           LPG is a better domestic fuel than wood due to:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            LPG has higher calorific value, so it produces much more heat on burning than an equal mass of wood.
           </li>
           <li>
            It burns without leaving behind any smoke.
           </li>
           <li>
            It burns completely without leaving behind any solid residue but wood leaves behind a lot of ash on burning.

           Question 49.
           <br/>
           Explain why, when a burning candle is covered with an inverted gas jar ,the candle gets extinguished after sometime.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When a burning candle is covered with an inverted gas jar, the oxygen supply gets cut-off. Oxygen is necessary for combustion to take place. It is a supporter of combustion. Hence the candle gets extinguished after sometime.

           <br/>
           It is difficult to burn a heap of green leaves but dry leaves catch fire easily. Explain.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           It is difficult to burn a heap of green leaves but dry leaves catch fire easily. The green leaves contain a lot of water. This water does not allow the green leaves to get heated to their ignition temperature and makes burning of green leaves difficult. Dry leaves do not contain water, they get heated to their ignition temperature easily and hence catches fire easily.

           Question 54.
           <br/>
           What is global warming? Name the gas whose increasing percentage in air is leading to global warming. State a harmful effect which can be caused by global warming.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Global warming is the rise in temperature of earth atmosphere caused by the excessive amount of carbon dioxide in the air. Due to rise in the temperature of atmosphere, the ice in polar regions will melt very fast, producing a lot of water. Burning of fuels releases carbon dioxide in air in the environment. Increased percentage of carbon dioxide in air is causing global warming. Carbon dioxide gas in the air trap sun’s heat rays by producing green house effect. Rise in water may cause a rise in the sea level leading to floods in coastal areas. The low-lying areas may be completely submerged under water leading to loss of life and property.

           Question 55.
           <br/>
           Explain how, burning if fuels such as coal, petrol and diesel leads to acid rain. How is acid rain harmful?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Burning of coal, petrol and diesel produces sulphur dioxide which goes into the air. It is an extremely suffocating and corrosive gas. It may damage our lungs. The burning of petrol and diesel in the engines of vehicles also releases nitrogen oxides into the air. These oxides produced by the burning of fuels dissolve in rain water and form acids. The rain water containing acid is called acid rain. It is harmful for crops, soil and damages buildings.

           Question 76.
           <br/>
           An electric spark is struck between two electrodes placed near each other in a closed tank full of petrol. Will the petrol catch fire. Explain your answer.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           As it is a closed tank full of petrol, there will be no supply of air. Hence the petrol will not catch fire as air is necessary for the combustion of petrol.

           Paper by itself catches fire easily whereas a piece of paper wrapped around an aluminium pipe does not.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A piece of paper wrapped around aluminium pipe does not catch fire easily. This is because aluminium, being a metal, is a good conductor of heat and hence heat is conducted away. Also, the ignition temperature of paper is lower compared to that of aluminium. When paper is wrapped around an aluminium pipe; the ignition temperature increases. That is why paper itself catches fire easily whereas a piece of paper wrapped around an aluminium pipe does not.

           Abida and Ramesh want to heat water taken in separate beakers. Abida kept the beaker near the wick in the yellow part of the candle flame. Ramesh kept the beaker in the outermost part of the flame. Whose water will get heated in a shorter time? Why?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The yellow part of the flame is the middlemost part where Abida has kept the beaker. The fuel vapours burn partially in the middle zone because there is not enough air of burning in this zone. The partial burning of fuel in the middle zone produces carbon particles. It has moderate temperature. Hence, Abida’s beaker will take time to heat up.
          </p>
          <p>
           Ramesh’s beaker is kept in the outermost part of the flame. In this zone, complete combustion of the fuel takes place because there is plenty of air around it. The outermost zone has the highest temperature in the flame. It is the hottest part of the flame. Hence Ramesh’s beaker gets heated in a shorter time.
          </p>

           Question 79.
           <br/>
           When a lot of dry powder of a substance X is released over a fire, the fire gets extinguished.
           <br/>
           (a) Name the substance X.
           <br/>
           (b) How does this substance extinguish the fire?
           <br/>
           (c) Name another substance which behaves like X.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Sodiumbicarbonate (sodiumhydrogencarbonate)
           <br/>
           (b) The heat of fire decomposes sodium bicarbonate to produce carbondioxide gas. This carbon dioxide covers the fire like a blanket and cuts off supply of fresh air to the burning substance. Due to this the fire gets extinguished
           <br/>
           (c) Potassium bicarbonate(or Potassium hydrogen carbonate)
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 80.
           <br/>
           What type of combustion is represented by:
           <br/>
           (a) burning of white phosphorus in air at room temperature?
           <br/>
           (b) burning of LPG in a gas stove?
           <br/>
           (c) ignition of a cracker?
           <br/>
           (d) burning of coal dust in a coalmine?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Burning of white phosphorus in air at room temperature is a spontaneous combustion. The type of combustion in which a material suddenly bursts into flames, without the application of any apparent cause is called spontaneous combustion.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Burning of LPG is combustion in which a substance burns rapidly and produces heat and light with the help of external heat.
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) Ignition of a cracker is a combustion in which a substance burns suddenly and produces heat, light and sound with the help of heat or pressure.
          </p>
          <p>
           (d) Burning of coal dust in a coalmine is a spontaneous combustion. The type of combustion in which a material suddenly bursts into flames, without the application of any apparent cause is called spontaneous combustion.
