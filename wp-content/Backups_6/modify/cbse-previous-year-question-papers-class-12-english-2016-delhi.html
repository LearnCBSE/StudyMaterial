           Subject: Chaotic conditions in the casualty department
           <br/>
           Dear Sir,
           <br/>
           I, Karan/Karuna, a resident of New Delhi want to bring to your kind notice the conditions of the Sunrise hospital. Yesterday, while I was going to my office, I witnessed a person lying on the road in a pool of blood. There was a crowd around him. On enquiry, I came to know that he was hit by an unidentified vehicle and nobody took the pain to take him to Sunrise hospital. So, I brought him to hospital where I was further shocked to see the pathetic condition a of the casualty ward. The corridors were full of people where the smell of medicines prevailed and cotton dabs were thrown away on the floor. I requested the doctor on duty to attend the patient immediately to avoid any mishap but was asked to file a police complaint first.
          </p>
          <p>
           The patient was left unattended for about an hour during which he lost ample amount of blood which could have been proved to be fatal. Later, when all the formalities were completed, the doctor came to see him and by God’s grace his life was saved. Then, again drugs were administered in an inappropriate way by the staff who came only after being reminded. I think this negligence could cost anyone their life someday. So, I request you to be more vigilant towards the working of the hospital.
           <br/>
           Yours truly,
           <br/>

           Sub: Improvisation of the living conditions in slums
           <br/>
           Dear Sir,
           <br/>
           Through the esteemed columns of your prestigious newspaper, I would like to highlight the quality of life of the people living in slums. Each family consists of six to seven members who share a single room. Their children can be seen playing on the heaps of garbage and breeding grounds of flies, mosquitoes and cockroaches. Sincere efforts are required to improve the physical, social and economic conditions of these slum dwellers. Practical action should be taken by providing access to clean drinking water, proper health and sanitation facilities, waste management services and better housing facilities.
          </p>
          <p>
           Slum upgrading should be a major part of the government’s agenda to alleviate the poor living standards of the people. But unless government takes a quick action, there can be no sustainable solution to the housing challenges. The government is not doing much regarding this reasons which may include low incentives, less financial resources, lack of provision of any such reform due to their short-term electoral period. But NGOs, training institutes, local residents, community groups can join hands together with government to eradicate the miseries of slum dwellers.
           <br/>
           Hope my letter would find a place in your newspaper.
           <br/>
           Yours Truly,

           Answer:

           POLICY OF RESERVATION OF SEATS’ IN PROFESSIONAL COURSES
           <br/>
           Good morning, respected judges and the esteemed audience! The topic of today’s debate is ‘Policy of reservation of seats for professional courses’, is good for the deprived section of the society, I, stand before you to speak against the motion.
          </p>
          <p>
           According to the Indian constitution, reservation in all the fields whether education, jobs or any other place, has been made to bring underprivileged classes at par with privileged or general ones. There are numerous reservations like reservation for women, reservation for physically challenged, reservation for economically backward class, reservation for scheduled castes, etc. But, I believe that this leads to further discrimination in the society. It had started with a very good objective of uplifting the socially backward society to give them equal opportunities. But with time its meaning has been changed and the aim of starting it is lost. People have started taking undue advantage of it. This has resulted in widespread protests and counter protests as it has affected thousands of jobs and admissions opportunities. Students securing 80 or 90 percent sometimes lag behind the underprivileged who do secure only 40 or 50 percent for taking admission in the vocational or professional courses.
          </p>
          <p>
           It denies the equality of opportunity to those who do not belong to backward communities. They are denied admissions even though they have secured a good percentage. This would also perpetuate caste feeling among people and hamper national unity. Also the reservation systems in India is creating manpower which is not able to compete at the global level. India needs people who can work for the growth and development but reservation is raising undeserving candidates at higher positions. Hence, I think a reservation system should be demolished.

           ‘BENEFITS OF EARLY RISING’
           <br/>
           Honorable Principal, respected teachers and my dear friends, Good Morning! I am Karan/Karuna, Head boy/Head Girl of the school; it is a great opportunity for me to share my views on the topic ‘Benefits of rising early’ in today’s assembly.
          </p>
          <p>
           We derive pleasure from many things, people, and places in our life. One such pleasure is when we get up early in the morning. It gives a good start to our mood. The air we breathe is so fresh that it refreshes our whole day. One should not miss the wonderful art of nature, rising of the sun from the dark color of midnight and gradually turning brighter, spreading its vibrant colors in the sky. This glory can’t be explained in words. We come into close contact with nature when we hear the chirping of birds, see green trees, flowers and leaves dancing. There is no chaos in the early morning and we can easily concentrate on our studies.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is well said that whatever we study in the early hours of morning is learnt quickly and our mind retains it forever. Early morning meditation helps in keeping our body and soul fit. Breakfast, the most important meal of the day can be taken up timely. Besides, many other things, one may get enough time to exercise which keeps the body energetic and fit throughout the day. Then our productivity and capacity to work also increases. There is no distraction in the morning hours in case we want to indulge in some creative activities.
           <br/>
           To sum up, I can say that I have full faith in the saying, “Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.”

           ‘FESTIVALS OF INDIA’
           <br/>
           By Karuna/Karan
           <br/>
           India is a land of colors. It is a country populated by the people of many castes, religions, faiths, communities, languages and creeds. Therefore, many festivals, celebrations, social and cultural gatherings, fairs take place every year. India is said to be a country which is full of pleasures, joys and festivities. Throughout the year, we celebrate many festivals. They represent the grandeur of the country. These are the occasions when families gather at one place and celebrate happy moments. Festivals are celebrated throughout the year and people await these festivals with great enthusiasm. These have an important place in the hearts of Indians as they believe that fasting on these occasions purify their soul and help them to lead a problem free life.
          </p>

           Some festivals are celebrated all over India and people celebrate them irrespective of their status and social position. These include Diwali, Holi and Dusshera. Each festival has its religious value and contains some mythology behind it. For example, Dusshera is celebrated on account of victory of good over evil and when Lord Ram killed Ravana. Similarly, Janmashtami has also a social and religious significance as Lord Krishna was bom to kill all the demons on the earth. Thus, each and every festival has its own value which . teaches people to come closer and forget all their differences.

           ‘HOW TO PROVIDE PROPER HEALTHCARE TO THE COMMON MAN’
           <br/>
           By Karuna/Karan
           <br/>
           A large section of our population is suffering from physical as well as mental problems like, fever, injury, epilepsy, learning disability, etc. Women have problems related to pregnancy and childbirth whereas children require immunization against common diseases. Most of these health woes have been the result of our changing life style, rising pollution, lack of nutritive value in food. Hence, they require access to health-care facilities and treatment. Unfortunately, health services are often planned without consulting the community members. To meet the necessities of the people for accessible and affordable services, community members should be consulted and involved in their planning. Health centers should be more vigilant.
          </p>
          <p>
           Most people prefer home remedial measures and go to the hospital or refer to a doctor only when the situation is beyond their control. But it’s not necessary that they will go to a well-qualified doctor, they may approach local pharmacist or traditional healers. Therefore, it is necessary that the health sector must intervene and create awareness among the people.
          </p>
          <p>
           Health care facilities should be within the reach of the common man. Government’s investment in public health care is very low. As a result, many hospitals run by the government do not provide sufficient medical facilities. Therefore, improvements are required in this sector and it is a positive thing that the government is now planning to allocate more funds for the renovation of hospitals.

          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Gandhiji was opposed to C.F. Andrews helping him in Champaran because he wanted the Indians to be self-dependent and self- reliant in their struggle against injustice.

           Teachers always advise their students to dream big. Yet, the same teachers in your classrooms find fault with Sophie when she dreams. What is wrong with Sophie’s dreams?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           There is no doubt that our language is a part of our culture and we feel proud of it. But the true value of it can be realized only when the freedom of speaking it, is taken away from us.
          </p>

           The story ‘The Last Lesson’ depicts the pathos of the whole situation, how people feel in not learning their language and losing an asset. One day Franz, one of the students came unwillingly to the school and noticed that everything was still and as quiet as a Sunday morning and there were elder people sitting quietly at the back of the classroom. There was an order from Berlin that French would not be taught any further in the schools and instead German was to be taught. This news shocked everyone. All the villagers gathered in the classroom to attend their last French lesson and to pay their respect for the French teacher, M. Hamel, who was going to deliver his last speech in French, the adults felt sorry that they had not attended the school and thanked Hamel for his faithful service.
          </p>
          <p>
           To honor his French lesson, M. Hamel also put on his fine Sunday clothes. His behavior changed to kindness. He even blamed himself for neglecting french as he used to give holidays when he wanted to go fishing or for watering his flowers. He told his students that it was the most beautiful and logical language and they should not forget it.

           It is a natural thing for teenagers to dream. They don’t have much liabilities and burden at that stage of life so they are free to dream. It is a part of their life but sometimes these dreams are impractical and non-realistic and when they are shattered, they cause a lot of pain.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the story ‘Going Places’, the author has described the feelings and dreams of a girl, a school-going teenager Sophie. She was a day dreamer and fantasized that she had met with Danny Casey, a football player from Ireland. She dreamt of having met him twice in the arcade. For her, he was a hero to be worshipped. She went to the place where she thought he would meet her and when he didn’t turn up, she felt disappointed. Then she thought of owning a boutique, becoming a manager, a fashion designer or an actress irrespective of her weak socio-economic status.
          </p>
          <p>
           She had not thought about where the money would come for opening a boutique. She was blind to the bitter truth of life. She dreamt of an imaginary life, full of beautiful things. It can be said that she wanted to lead a lavish and grand life which was not possible. She was over ambitious. Her dreams were unrealistic in the sense that ultimately she would have to work in a biscuit factory.

           How did Jo want the Roger Skunk story to end? Why?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Derry sneaked into Mr. Lamb’s garden and it became a turning point in his life. Before that, Derry used to live an isolated life. He did not like meeting people or socializing. The reason was his acid-burnt face, seeing which people often got terrified. He began leading a secluded life.
          </p>
          <p>
           Meeting Mr. Lamb brought a change in his life. His attitude towards life was completely changed. Mr. Lamb gave him confidence and supported him morally as he was too physically impaired like him. He had a tin leg because the original one was blown off in the war. He told Derry that he was not affected by people’s sarcastic remarks. He motivated Derry to face the challenges of life and not to lament over his burnt face. According to him, he was lucky to have two arms, two legs, ears, eyes and tongue. He could do far better than others.
          </p>
          <p>
           All these preachings left an impression on Derry and then he started looking at things and the world differently. He began to help Mr. Lamb with crab apples and developed a positive attitude towards life.

           Jack used to tell his little daughter Jo, bedtime stories. As soon as she grew a bit older, she began to ask questions from her father. Once her father told her a story of a little animal called Skunk who smelled bad. He therefore, met with a wizard who solved his problem a magic wand and made him smell like roses. But the Skunk’s mother did not like it and took him back to the wizard to smell bad once again.
          </p>
          <p>
           This ending was not acceptable to Jo as she wanted the story to have another ending where the wizard would hit the mommy with his magic wand and shop off her arms ‘forcibly.’ Jo thought that Roger was the hero of the story so he must not look ugly; or stinky. Jo’s perspective on life was different from her father’s. She wanted the wizard to hit mommy on head as a punishment as she imposed her will on her son unnecessarily. According to Jo, Roger should be allowed to choose his own life. Moreover, she didn’t want the story to end sadly.
          </p>
          <p>
           She wanted to change the end of the story to assert her views on her father. She had her own ideals and views which she wanted to pursue.

           <br/>
           Subject: Traffic congestion on the road surrounding the schools.
           <br/>
           This letter intends to be to your kind the serious problem of traffic mess near the school’s surroqnding which has caused great inconvenience. There are four reputed public schools in the ambit of the area. In the morning, the movement of the school transport, staff vehicles and the vehicles of the parents, who come to drop their children, along with the general traffic, creates a huge chaos on the road. The same chaos could be witnessed in the afternoon when the school gets off. The situation gets worse when the traffic lights don’t work. The children, who come from the nearby areas, find it difficult to cross the roads and face a huge risk.
          </p>
          <p>
           The safety of the children is of utmost importance for the schools. Therefore I would request you to appoint traffic police on different points of the roads around the schools, so as to avoid traffic jams. Also, a regular check of the traffic lights would help in reducing inconvenience. The schools are also planning to arrange traffic rules awareness workshop for their respective staff, parents, and children. I request you to look into the matter and solve the issue at the earliest.
           <br/>

           <br/>
           RISING PRICES CAN BE CONTROLLED ONLY BY THE GOVERNMENT’
           <br/>
           A very good morning to jury members, friends and my fellow opponents!! am Karan/Karuna of Head boy/Head girl. Today, I am going to speak against the motion’ Rising prices can be controlled only by the government.’ The role of government in an economy is to announce measures of regulation and control. A government can impose restrictions on hoarding, the export of some items and track prices of limited commodities. However, the execution vests in the custody of the people residing in the nation.
          </p>
          <p>
           It would not be correct to put the blame wholly on the government. The consumer is no less to be blamed for inflation. Some consumers allow themselves to be robbed due to the fear of insufficient good supply and adverse price trends. Also, some consumers indulge themselves into hoarding and black marketing of the products. Such practices not only deprive the country of much-needed resources but also serve as bad examples for those who cannot afford to pay such high prices. By reducing the demand of a good, its price can be controlled by the consumers. Thus, I believe, the rising prices or inflation can be controlled by the combined effort of the government and consumers.

           LIBRARY PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE AT SCHOOL
           <br/>
           Good morning everyone!
           <br/>
           Respected Principal, teachers and my dear friends, I am Karan/Karuna, the head boy/ Head Girl of your school, and I am going to give a short speech on how ‘Library plays an important role at school.’ A school library is a place that plays an important role in encouraging innovation and thirst for knowledge. It provides support for learning and teaching throughout the school. The school library exhibits positive impact on the academic achievement of the student, as it helps in developing the mind of the student. It is integral to the teaching and learning process. A library at school not only provides academic references but a wide range of fiction, non-fiction, digital and print resources. It develops the habit of reading in students and helps to to enhance students’ intellectual, cultural and emotional growth. The school library also provides opportunities for teachers to plan, implement and evaluate new learning programs.
          </p>
          <p>
           It also plays a critical role in assisting the students in compiling, critically analyzing and organizing information, and then presenting their findings. A school library provides a safe environment that encourages curiosity and imagination. The students become users of information and start to develop a better understanding of the world.
           <br/>
           Thank you
          </p>

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           THE POLICY OF NO DETENTION TILL CLASS VIII IS NOT IN THE INTEREST OF STUDENTS
           <br/>
           A very good morning to jury members, friends, and my fellow opponents. Today, I am going to speak for the motion ‘The policy of no detention till class VIII is not in the interest of the students.’ Firstly, let me tell you what the no-detention policy states. The policy states that no child shall be held back in any class or expelled from the school till the completion of elementary education. The step was taken to reduce stress and pressure among students, but the policy has led to poor outcomes, as there has hardly been any improvement in the academic standard. It has encouraged negligence and reluctance in children to study. The student develops a carefree and an easy going attitude, due to an automatic promotion system up to class VIII, and in class IX, he is unable to change his attitude. Suddenly, they fail to cope up with the academic pressure and end up performing badly in board exams.
          </p>
          <p>
           I, therefore, firmly agree that the policy of no detention till class VIII is not in the interest of students, as it gives then the security of making it to the next class, regardless of a child’s competence to learn higher concepts.

           A STUDENT MUST KNOW HOW TO MANAGE HIS TIME
           <br/>
           Good morning everyone!
           <br/>
           Respected principal, teachers and all my dear friends, I, Karan/Karuna, the head boy/head girl of your school, am going to give a short speech on the topic, ‘A student must know how to manage his time’.
          </p>
          <p>
           When life takes a highway and everything seems to be going out of control, the only thing that can bring back the required pace in life is time management because a student’s time is so valuable, it is important to use it wisely. This can be done by taking advantage of an idle time that could be spent studying. This could happen during lunch, on the bus ride to and fro from school or before a class starts.
          </p>
          <p>
           A student must prioritize what comes first in his life.
           <br/>
           Spending time with friends, family and having fun is important to provide a healthy balance. To successfully satisfy their personal life and meet education obligations, students must learn to juggle the two effectively by managing their time well.
          </p>
          <p>
           When you get into the habit of procastinating as a student, you tend to do the same as an adult. Habits that are learned at an early are hard to change when you become old. Therefore, develop a sense of responsibility towards your task at an early.
           <br/>
           Thank you.

           Question 7.
           <br/>
           India is an emerging economy, we are rich in natural resources. Yet a significant proportion of our people is living below poverty line. One cause of this poverty is our rising population. Write an article is 150-200 words on ‘How to keep a check on population/ You are Karuna/Karan. [10]

           OR
           <br/>
           Women feel unsafe on the road, at their place of work and even at home. There is an urgent need to change the male mindset in its attitude towards women.

           HOW TO KEEP A CHECK ON POPULATION
           <br/>
           By Karan/Karuna
           <br/>
           An economy requires the support of its population to function smoothly. The fact remains intact that India is extremely rich in its natural resources, yet incapable of sustaining its population. We often ponder over the question. Who is responsible for the imbalance? Is it the current government? Is it the lack of facility? Or is it just ignorance?
          </p>
          <p>
           The disproportionate distribution of wealth in the country is mostly an outcome of the humongous population, hyperbolically termed as the ‘Population Explosion’. The government, at regular intervals, has introduced birth control schemes and programmes, such as ‘Hum Do Hamare Do’.
          </p>
          <p>
           Such programs have failed tremendously because of the illiteracy and religiously guided notions of the people. The only way possible to curb the population is to educate the Indian population. The beliefs and desirability of having a male child also increases the population, which can be checked by making people understant that it is better to facilitate the children in a manner to empower them without being gender biased. The government can work effectively only when the population understands the fragility and the need of the moment.

           ‘HOW TO MAKE WOMEN FEEL SAFE’
           <br/>
           By: Karan/Karuna
           <br/>
           The safety of women in the modern society is increasingly becoming a grave concern by each passing day. It is no longer an issue of morals but of criminalist mentality of a majority of the male sector of our society. Ensuring security of women can never be possible by restraining them to their houses. It can never be the solution. It is said, that to solve a problem effectively and efficiently, its root needs to be targeted’ and in the same way, we need to put efforts into educating our boys and quite evidently, men as well, to respect the women. Rather than teaching a girl how to live with restrictions, we should teach a boy how to respect and accept the girl’s wishes. This will help to reduce the cause a lot, but in order to eradicate the problem, severe legal measures are needed to be taken.
          </p>
          <p>
           The criminals should be punished severely and the legal procedures should be shortened. Domestic violence against women should not be tolerated and programs should be set-up to support women suffering in these scenarios. The aggressors in such cases need to be adequately penalized. The women should be trained the basic self-defense at an early age. Besides, taking these measures, special forces need to be posted at all places where crimes against women are more frequent, like tourist sites and secluded places. Special help-line numbers need to be set-up and effective and quick aid should be provided to women whenever and wherever required.

           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Answer any four of the following in 30-40 words each: [12]
           <br/>
           (a) How did his experience at the YMCA swimming pool affect Douglas?
           <br/>
           (b) What hospitality did the peddler receive from the crofter?
           <br/>
           (e) What kind of life was enjoyed by crown prince Jung Bahadur till he reached the age of twenty?
           <br/>
           (f) Where, when and how did Dr. Sadao meet Hana?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The experience created a terrible fear in the heart of Douglas for a long time, after his YMCA swimming pool experience when Douglas hit the pool, he started drowning when he was saved, he became weak and rembled badly. He conldn’t even eat for many days as he felt sick in the stomach. This made Douglas more afraid of water. The very sight of water made him ill. Douglas decided not to play any water sports.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Unlike the indifferent attitude of the others towards him, the peddler was whole heartedly welcomed by the crofter in his cottage. The crofter, at once, put the porridge pot on fire and gave him supper. He gave him a roll of tobacco for his pipe. He also played a game of cards with him.
          </p>
          <p>
           (e) The British dominance and its effect on the Indian royalty are evident in the upbringing of the crown prince Jung Bahadur. He was brought up by an English nanny, drank the milk of an English cow, taught English by an Englishman and watched English films.
          </p>
          <p>
           (f) Dr. Sadao met Hana in America at the house of a professor Harley where some foreign students were living. He liked her but waited to fall in love with her until he was sure she was a pure Japanese.
