            Question 1. What are macro-nutrients and why are they called macro-nutrients?
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Macro-nutrients are the essential elements which are utilised by plants in large quantities. Many macro-nutrients are required by the plants for the following functions:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            As the constituent of protoplasm
           </li>
           <li>
            N, P, S are present in proteins
           </li>
           <li>
            Ca is present in cell wall
           </li>
           <li>
            Mg is important constituent of chlorophyll
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Question 2. How do plants get nutrients?

           <br/>
           <strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Plants get nutrients from air, water and soil. There are, sixteen nutrients essential for the growth of plants. Carbon and Oxygen are supplied by water. The remaining thirteen nutrients are supplied by soil.

           <strong>
            Question 1. Compare the use of manure and fertilizers in maintaining soil fertility.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer: Effects of using manures on soil quality:
           </strong>
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            The manures enrich the soil with nutrients.
           </li>
           <li>
            They provide a lot of organic matter (humus) to the soil and thus restores water retention capacity of sandy soils and drainage in clayey soil.
           </li>
           <li>
            The addition of manures reduces soil erosion.
           </li>
           <li>
            They provide food for soil organisms, like soil friendly bacteria.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Effects of using fertilizers on soil quality:
           </strong>
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            By the continuous use of fertilizers, the soil becomes powdery, dry and rate of soil erosion increases.
           </li>
           <li>
            By the use of fertilizers, the organic matter decreases which further decreases the porosity of soil and the plant roots do not get oxygen properly,
           </li>
           <li>
            The nature of soil changes to acidic or basic.
           </li>

            Question 1. Which of the following conditions will give the most benefits? Why?
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (a) Farmers use high-quality seeds, do not adopt irrigation or use fertilizers.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (b) Farmers use ordinary seeds, adopt irrigation and use fertilizer.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (c) Farmers use quality seeds, adopt irrigation, use fertilizer and use crop protection measures.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           In this, (c) Farmers use quality seeds, adopt irrigation, use fertilizer and use crop protection measures.
           <br/>
           Use of any quality seeds is not sufficient until they are properly irrigated, enriched with fertilizers and protected from biotic factors. Hence, option (c) will give the most benefits.

            Question.1. Why should preventive measures and biological control methods be preferred for protecting crops?
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Diseases in plants are caused by pathogens. To get rid of pathogens, some preventive measures and biological control methods are used as they are simple, economic and minimise pollution without affecting the soil quality.

           </strong>
           Cross breeding is a process in which indigenous varities of cattle are crossed by exotic breeds to get a breed which is high yielding. During cross breeding, the desired characters are taken into consideration. The offspring should be high yielding, should have early maturity and should be resistant to climatic conditions.

            Answer:
           </strong>
           The basic aim of poultry farming is to raise domestic fowl for egg production and chicken meat. These poultry birds are not only the efficient converters of agricultural by-products, particularly cheaper fibrous wastes (which is unfit for human consumption but can be formulated into cheaper diets for poultry birds) into high quality meat and also help in providing egg, feathers and nutrient rich manure. For this reasons, it is said that, “poultry is India’s most efficient converter of low fibre food stuff into highly nutritious animal protein food”.

            Answer:
           </strong>
           The poultry bird groomed for obtaining meat is called broiler. The egg laying poultry bird is called layer.
           <br/>
           The housing, nutritional and environmental requirements of broilers are somewhat different from those of egg layers.
           <br/>
           The ration (daily food requirement) for broilers is protein rich with adequate fat. The level of vitamins A and K is kept high in the poultry feeds while layers require enough space and proper lightning.

            Answer:
           </strong>
           In composite fish culture, a combination of five or six fish species is used in a single fish pond. These species are selected so that they do not compete for food among them and are having different types of food habits. As a result, the food available in all the parts of the pond is used. For example, Catlas are surface feeders, Rohus feed in the middle-zone of the pond, Mrigals and Common Carps are bottom feeders and Grass Carps feed on the weeds, together these species can use all the food in the pond without competing with each other. This increases the fish yield from pond.

            Answer:
           </strong>
           One method used for crop production which ensures high yield is plant breeding. It is the science involved in improving the varieties of crops by breeding plants. The plants from different areas/places is picked up with desired traits and then hybridisation or cross-breeding of these varieties is done to obtain a plant/crop of desired characteristic.
           <br/>
           The high yielding crop variety shows the following characteristics:
           <br/>
           High yield, early maturation, less water for irrigation, better quality seeds are produced, less fertilizers required, adapts itself to the environmental conditions.

           <strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Manures contain large ‘ quantities of organic matter and supplies small quantities of nutrients to the soil. It is prepared naturally by the decomposition of animal waste, excreta and plant waste.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            It helps in the soil enrichment with nutrients.
           </li>
           <li>
            It helps in improving the soil structure.
           </li>
           <li>
            It helps in increasing the water holding capacity in sandy soils.
           </li>
           <li>
            In clayey soils it helps in the water drainage and prevent water logging. Manure is classified based on the kind of biological material used to make it as : (i) Compost (ii) Vermi-compost (iitj Green manure
            <br/>
            <strong>
             (i) Compost:
            </strong>
            The farm waste and livestock excreta, along with vegetable waste, sewage waste, weeds, straws etc. are allowed to decompose in a pit is called compost. The compost is rich in nutrients.
            <br/>
            <strong>
             (ii) Vermi-compost:
            </strong>
            When the above given matter is allowed to decompose in the pit along with some earthworms, the decomposition speeds up and is called vermi-composting.
            <br/>
            <strong>
             (iii) Green manure:
            </strong>
            Some plants like sun-hemp or guar are grown and then mulched by ploughing them into the soil. This is done before the sowing of crop seeds into the field.
            <br/>
            These green plants present in the soil acts as green manure which enriches the soil in nitrogen and phosphorus.

           <strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Fertilizers are obtained artificially on commercial basis. It is a chemical which contains the nutrients required for the crop to grow. Fertilizers supply various nutrients as they are nutrient specific e.g.-urea provides nitrogen. Mixed fertilizer provides any two mixture of nutrients. They are expensive but their use yield large production hence are a factor of high cost farming.
           <br/>
           Excessive use of fertilizers are not advisable as:
           <br/>
           (a) It leads to soil and water pollution.
           <br/>
           (b) It can destroy the fertility of soil. As the soil is not replenished, micro¬organisms in the soil are harmed by fertilizers.

            Answer:
           </strong>
           Different ways/patterns / systems of growing crop’s are:
           <br/>
           (a) Mixed cropping (b) Inter-cropping (c) Crop rotation.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Mixed cropping:
           </strong>
           It is a method in which two or more crops grow simultaneously on the same piece of land.
           <br/>
           Example, Wheat + grain, wheat + mustard or groundnut + sunflower.
           <br/>
           This helps in the reduction of risk factor and provides insurance against failure of one of the crops.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Inter-cropping:
           </strong>
           It is a method of growing two or more crops simultaneously on the same field in a definite patterns. A few row of one crop alternate with a few rows of second crop.
           <br/>
           Example, soyabean + maize or bajra + lobia
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Crop rotation:
           </strong>
           The growing of different crops on a piece of land in a pre¬planned succession is known as crop rotation.
           <br/>
           The availability of moisture and irrigation facility decides the choice of crop to be cultivated after one harvest.
