            </strong>
           </span>
           At the time of independence, development was about becoming more like the industrialised countries of the West, to be involved with the break down of traditional social structure as well as rise of capitalism and liberalism.
           <br/>
           1. Modernisation referred to growth, material progress and scientific rationality.
           <br/>
           2. India had two models of modern development at the time of independence into considerations to be adopted i.e. the liberal capitalist model like Europe and the US and the socialist model like the USSR.
           <br/>
           3. A debate had been occurred regarding adoption of model of development as communists, socialists and Pt.
           <br/>
           J.L. Nehru supported the socialist model to reflect a broad consensus to be developed during national movement.
           <br/>
           4. Above mentioned intentions cleared that the government made the priority to poverty alleviation alongwith social and economic redistribution.
           <br/>
           5. At the same time, these leaders differed and debated:
           <br/>
           (a) Industrialisation should be the preferred path or
           <br/>
           (b) Agricultural development should take place or
           <br/>
           (c) Rural poverty should be alleviated.

            </strong>
           </span>
           The First Five Year Plan was commenced in 1951 to be drafted by Young Economist
           <br/>
           K.N. Roy with the emphasis on poverty alleviation. Its main thrusts were as follows:
           <br/>
           1. To invest in dams and irrigation to improve agricultural sector with the urgent attention.
           <br/>
           2. Huge allocations were made for large scale projects like Bhakra-Nangal Dam.
           <br/>
           3. It focused on land reforms for the development in rural areas.
           <br/>
           4. It aimed to increase level of National Income.
           <br/>
           The first five year plan differed from the second five year plan:
           <br/>
           (a) TheSecondFiveYearPlanstressed on heavy industrialisation.
           <br/>
           (b) Second Five Year Plan wanted to bring quick structural transformation in all possible directions in place of slow and steady growth like First Five Year Plan.

           Green Revolution was introduced to bring about revolutionary changes in agriculture especially in foodgrains like wheat and rice to increase production through high yielding varieties of seeds, fertilisers and scientific irrigation—
           <br/>
           1. The government offered high yielding varieties of seeds, fertilizers, pesticides and better irrigation facilities at subsidised prices to farmers.
           <br/>
           2. The government fixed the prices also to purchase the produce of farmers at a given price.
           <br/>
           Positive Consequences:
           <br/>
           (i) In many parts, the stark contrast between the poor peasantry and the landlords produced conditions favourable for left wing organisations to organise the poor peasants.
           <br/>
           (ii) It resulted in the rise of what is called the ‘Middle peasant sections’ who were farmers with medium size holdings who benefitted from the changes and soon emerged politically influential in many parts of country.
           <br/>
           Negative Consequences:
           <br/>
           (i) This created a stark contrast between the poor peasantry and the landlords.
           <br/>
           (ii) It delivered only a moderate agricultural growth i.e. a rise in rice and wheat production by raising availability of foodgrains in country. On the other hand it increased polarisation between the classes and regions like Northern States
           <br/>
           i. e. Punjab, Haryana, West-UP become agriculturally rich but others remained backward.

           At the time of Second Five Year Plan, some controversial issues rose in reference of relevancy of agriculture over industry.
           <br/>
           1. Second Five Year Plan emphasised on industry in place of agriculture or rural India.
           <br/>
           2. J.C. Kumarappa, a Gandhian Economist proposed an alternative blueprint to emphasise on rural industrialisation.
           <br/>
           3. Bharatiya Lok Dal leader, Chaudhary Charan Singh also commented that the planning leading to creation of prosperity in Urban and industrial sections at the cost of rural welfare. Others debated that without an increase in industrial sector poverty could not be alleviated:
           <br/>
           (i) India planning did not have an agrarian strategy to boost the production of food grains.
           <br/>
           (ii) It also proposed programmes of community development and spent large sums on irrigation project and failure was not that of policy but of its non¬implementation because of the politics of land owning classes.
           <br/>
           (in) Besides, they also argued that every if the government had spent more money on agriculture it would not have solved the massive problem of rural poverty.

           No, the above statement is not perfectly true because state’s intervention was mandatory to regulate country’s economy
           <br/>
           after independence immediately. Indian did not follow either capitalist model of development or socialist model completely. Instead she adopted the model of‘mixed economy’ to be criticised from the right and the left:
           <br/>
           (i) Private sector lacked enough space and stimulus to grow.
           <br/>
           (ii) Licensing and permits for investment in private sector created hurdles for private capital accumulation.
           <br/>
           (iii) The state control beyond the limits led to inefficiency and corruption. State control was emphasised:
           <br/>
           1. State helped the private sector to make profits by intervening only in those areas where the private sector was not prepared to go.
           <br/>
           2. Instead of helping the poor, the states intervention ended up creating a new class that enjoyed the privileges of higher salaries without much account-ability.

             two contradictory tendencies were already well advanced inside the Congress Party.

           (b) Congress was pursuing this policy as a sole criterion of achieving maximum increased in production. Yes, it was related to the nature of opposition parties to be pursued liberal economic policies and incentives to private investment.

           (c) No, there was not a contradiction between the central leadership of the Congress Party and its state level leaders because state emphasised on states’ ownership, regulation and control over key sectors improve productivity whereas control leadership pursued liberal economic policies and incentives to private investment.

           Two Merits of the Green Revolution:
           <br/>
           (i) The Green Revolution ensured food sufficiency in the country. In many parts, the stark contrast between the poor peasantry and the landlords produced conditions favourable for left wing organisations to organise the poor peasants.
           <br/>
           (ii) The Green Revolution resulted in the rise of middle peasant sections.
           <br/>
           These were farmers with medium size holding, who benefited from the changes and soon emerged politically influential in many parts of the country.
           <br/>
           Two Demerits of the Green Revolution:
           <br/>
           (i) The Green Revolution delivered only moderate agricultural growth and raised the availability of food in the country but also increased polarisation between classes and regions.
           <br/>
           (ii) Some regions like Punjab, Haryana and Western UP became agriculturally prosperous while others remained backward.

            It was in Bihar that the food-crisis was most acutely felt as the state faced a near-famine situation. The food shortage was significant in all districts of Bihar, with 9 districts producing less than half of their normal output. Five of these districts, in fact, produced less than one- third of what they produced normally. Food deprivation subsequently led to acute and widespread malnutrition. It was estimated that the calorie intake dropped from 2200 per capital per day to as low as 1200 in many regions of the

           Green Revolution was introduced to bring about revolutionary changes in agriculture especially in foodgrains like wheat and rice to increase food production through high yielding varieties of seeds, fertilisers and scientific irrigation. Positive Consequences:
           <br/>
           1. In many parts, the stark contrast between the poor peasantry and the landlords produced conditions favourable for left wing organisations to organise the poor peasants.
           <br/>
           It resulted in the rise of what is called the ‘Middle Peasant Sections’
           <br/>
           who were farmers with medium size holdings who benefitted from the changes and soon emerged politically influential in many parts of country. Negative Consequences:
           <br/>
           (i) This created a stark contrast between the poor peasantry and the landlords.
           <br/>
           (ii) It delivered only a moderate agricultural growth i.e. a rise in rice and wheat production by raising availability of foodgrains in country. On the other hand it increased polarisation between the classes and regions like Northern States i. e. Punjab, Haryana, West-U.P. became agriculturally rich but others remained backward.

            </strong>
           </span>
           At the time of second five year plan, some controversial issues rose in reference of relevancy of agriculture over industry:
           <br/>
           1. Second five year plan emphasised on industry in place of agriculture or rural India.
           <br/>
           2. J.C. Kumarappa, a Gandhian Economist proposed an alternative blueprint to emphasise on rural industrialisation.
           <br/>
           3. Bharatiya Lok Dal leader, Chaudhary Charan Singh also commented that the planning was leading to creation of prosperity in Urban and industrial sections at the cost of rural welfare.
           <br/>
           Others debated that without an increase in industrial sector poverty could not be alleviated:
           <br/>
           1. India planning did not have agrarian strategy to boost the production of foodgrains.
           <br/>
           2. It also proposed programme of community development and spent large sums on irrigation projects and failure was not that of policy but of its non-implementation because of the politics of land owning classes.
           <br/>
           3. Besides they also argued that even if the government had spent more money on agriculture, it would not have solved the massive problems of rural poverty.
