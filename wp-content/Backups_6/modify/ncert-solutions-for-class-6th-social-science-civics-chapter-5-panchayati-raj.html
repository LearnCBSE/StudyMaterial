           The Gram Sabha is the most important body of the Panchayati Raj System. It is responsible for planning out the strategies for the development of the village, implementation of the ruling provisions. It also looks after the basic amenities of village people. It is also the custodian of the public property of the village.
          </p>
          <p>
           Education, law, and order, primary health services are some of the other responsibilities of the Gram Sabha. It also checks the wrong decisions taken by the Gram Panchayat. It keeps an eye on the elected representative and in making them responsible to the persons who elected them.

           It is important for all members to attend Gram Sabha meetings because it is the only way to participate in the proceedings of various plans discussed in the meetings. The members of Gram Sabha represent different areas. So, it is important for them to put their local problems and development programmes in the meetings. If they remain absent from the meetings, their interests may be overlooked.

Bhagavan Mahadeo Lad (35) of this village was beaten with sticks, iron rods, and axes by a group of seven men. The incident came to light when some villagers brought a badly injured Lad to the hospital for treatment. In the FIR recorded by the police Lad said that he was attacked when he insisted that the water in the tanker must’be emptied into the storage tanks

          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            There was acute water crisis in Nimone village and the villagers had to depend on tankers for their needs. So, when the tanker came in the village, Bhagvan insisted that the water in the tanker must be emptied into the storage tanks constructed as part of the water supply scheme by Nimone Gram Panchayat so that there would be equal distribution of water. But the upper caste men were against this and therefore they beat Bhagvan to suppress his demand.
           </li>
           <li>
            Yes, the above is a case of discrimination, because the upper caste men tries to suppress the genuine demand of the lower castes. They look them down upon and ignore their existence.
