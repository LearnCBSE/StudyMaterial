           Question 31 A.
           <br/>
           Why is it is necessary to dry the harvested food grains before storage ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The fresh crop has more moisture. So, the food grains obtained by harvesting the crop are dried before storage. If freshly harvested food grains are stored without drying, they may get spoilt or attacked by organisms, losing their germination capacity.
          </p>

           Question 34.
           <br/>
           Explain how, the irrigation requirements depend on the nature of the crop.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Proper watering of crop at right time is called irrigation. Each crop needs a specific amount of water during its various stages of its growth. The irrigation requirements depend on the nature of crop. Some crops like paddy crop (rice crop) need more water whereas other crops like wheat, gram require less water.

           Question 35.
           <br/>
           Explain how, the irrigation requirements of a crop depend on the nature of soil in which the crop is grown.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The irrigation requirements of a crop depend on the nature of soil in which the crop is grown. There are two types of soil- sandy soil and clayey soil. Sandy soil is highly porous having highly permeability. So, the water quickly percolates down to the soil and crop plants standing in the sandy soil, are not able to get adequate amount of water. Thus, crop cultivated in sandy soil need more frequent irrigation of water. On the other hand, the clayey soil is much less permeable than sandy soil due to which it can retain water for a much longer time. Thus, crop cultivated in clayey soil can absorb adequate amount of water. Hence, the crop grown in a clayey soil need irrigation less frequently.

           Question 36.
           <br/>
           Describe the sprinkler system of irrigation. State its advantages.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In the sprinkler system of irrigation, a main pipeline is laid in the field. The perpendicular pipes, having rotating nozzles on top, are joined to the main pipeline at regular intervals. When water is allowed to flow through the main pipe under pressure with the help of a pump, it escapes from the rotating nozzles. It gets sprinkled on the crop as if it is raining.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In this system, there is a network of narrow pipes with small holes, in the fields. When water flows through these pipes, water falls drop by drop just at the position of the roots. So, it is called drip system. Water is not wasted at all. It is the best technique for watering fruit plants, gardens and trees.
           <br/>
           Advantages:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Drip system is very useful in those regions where availability of water is poor.
           </li>
           <li>
            Drip system provides water to plants drop by drop. So, water is not wasted at all.

           Question 38.
           <br/>
           How do the irrigation requirements of a wheat crop differ from that of a paddy crop ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Each crop needs a specific amount of water during its various stages of its growth. The irrigation requirements depend on the nature of crop. Some crops like need more water whereas other crops require less water. For example, paddy crop requires continuous irrigation whereas wheat crop requires less water.

           Question 39.
           <br/>
           Explain why, the frequency of irrigation of crops is higher in summer season.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The frequency of irrigation of crops is higher in summer season due to the increased rate of evaporation of water from the soil and the leaves.

           Question 40.
           <br/>
           How are weeds removed from the crop fields ? Name one implement used for weeding.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The removal of weeds from the crop fields is known as weeding. It is necessary process as weed competes with the crop plants for water, nutrients and space. Farmers adopt many ways to remove weeds and control their growth. The various ways by which weeds are removed from the crop fields are-
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            With hand – In this method, weeds are removed manually by uprooting or cutting them close to the ground.
           </li>
           <li>
            By using a khurpa – In this method, weeds can be removed by using a implement called khurpa.
           </li>
           <li>
            By using weedicides- Example- 2, 4-D

           Question 46.
           <br/>
           Describe briefly, how soil is prepared for sowing the seeds.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The preparation of soil is the first step before growing a crop. The soil is prepared for sowing the seeds of crop by ploughing, levelling and manuring. The process of loosening and turning the soil is called ploughing. It is done by using a tool called plough. It is made up of wood or iron. One of the important task in agriculture is to turn the soil and loosen it. It allows the roots to penetrate deep into the soil so that plants are held more firmly to the soil. The ploughed field may have big pieces of soil called crumbs. It is necessary to break these crumbs with a plank. The levelling of ploughed soil is done by using an implement called leveller. Sometimes, manure is added to the soil before tilling. This helps in proper mixing of manure with soil. Once the soil is ploughed, levelled and manured, it is ready for sowing of seeds.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 47.
           <br/>
           Why do farmers carry out levelling of the ploughed fields?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Top layer of soil supports plant growth. It gets loss due to ploughing because of which it can easily washed away by rain or blown away by wind. So, ploughed soil is levelled by pressing it with a wooden leveller, so that top soil is not blown away by wind or washed away by water.

           Question 48.
           <br/>
           What are the advantages of sowing seeds. with a seed drill?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Following are the advantages of sowing seeds with a seed drill:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Seed drill sows the seeds uniformly at proper distance and correct depths.
           </li>
           <li>
            It sows the seeds in regular rows.
           </li>
           <li>
            It ensures that seeds get covered by the soil after sowing as a result of which seeds cannot be picked by birds
           </li>
           <li>
            Sowing by using a tractor joined with seed drill saves time and labor.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           Question 49.
           <br/>
           Explain why, the seeds should be sown at right spacings.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Seeds should be sown at right spacings. They should be neither sown too close nor too far apart. If seeds are placed too close, then plants formed form them will be also too close and will not get enough sunlight, water and nutrients to grow. On the other hand, if seeds are placed too far, then it will be a wastage of field space. Thus, the seeds should be sown at right spacing to proper growth.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Plants require nutrients for their proper growth and functioning. If continuous plantation of crops is done in the fields then the soil will become poor in necessary nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, etc. This affect the yield and also affects the quality of soil. So, the nutrients once consumed by crop must be replenished so that soil get all its nutrients back and it will be ready for the next harvest.

           <br/>
           What is irrigation? Why is irrigation necessary?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The supply of water to crops at right time is called irrigation. All the crop plants need water for their growth. Water is important for proper growth and development of flowers, fruits and seeds of plants.
          </p>
          <p>
           Irrigation is necessary for the absorption of nutrients by plants from the soil. Water is absorbed by the plant roots. Along with water, minerals and fertilizers are also absorbed.
          </p>
          <p>
           Irrigation is necessary to provide moisture for germination of seeds because germination of seeds does not take place under dry conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
           Irrigation is also necessary for healthy crop growth so as to get good yield. Nutrients dissolved in water get transported to each part of the plant. Water also protects the crop from both frost and hot air currents.
