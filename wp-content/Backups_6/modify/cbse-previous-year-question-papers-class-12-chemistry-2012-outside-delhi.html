           Answer:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            An aerosol is a colloid in which dispersed phase is a solid and dispersion medium is a gas eg., Dust, smoke.
           </li>
           <li>
            An emulsion is a colloid solution in which both the dispersed phase and dispersion medium are in the liquid state, eg., Milk and cod liver oil.

           <li>
            Among lanthanoids, Ln (III) compounds are predominant. However, occasionally in solution or in solid compounds, +2 and +4 ions are also obtained.
           </li>
           <li>

            /m) for copper is positive (0.34 V). Copper is the only metal in the first series of transition elements showing this behaviour.
           </li>
           <li>
            The metallic radii of the third (5d) series of transition metals are nearly the same as those of the corresponding members of the second series.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           Answer:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Some lanthanoid show +2 and +4 oxidation states in ionic solutions or solid components due to the extra stability that arises because of empty half-filled or fully filled 4f-subshell.
           </li>
           <li>
            This is because copper has a high enthalpy of atomization and low enthalpy of hydration. Hence, E
            <sup>
             0
            </sup>

            /Cu) is positive.
           </li>
           <li>
            This is because of lanthanoid contraction the metallic radii of the third (5d) series of transition metals are nearly the same as those of the corresponding members of the second series.

           What is essentially the difference between α-glucose and β-glucose? What is meant by pyranose structure of glucose? [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           α-glucose and β-glucose are two cyclic hemiacetal forms of glucose which differ only in the configuration of the hydroxyl group (-OH) at anomeric carbon. Such isomers are called anomers. The six-membered cyclic structure of glucose is called the pyranose structure.

           <img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 Chemistry 2012 Outside Delhi Set I Q29" height="206" loading="lazy" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48581655837_cc5c0da196_o.png" width="303"/>
           <br/>
           (b) (i) Due to strong S—S bond and less interelectronic repulsion, sulphur has a greater tendency for catenation.
           <br/>
           (ii) I—Cl bond is polar and hence more reactive compound to I

           in which I—I bond is non-polar.
           <br/>

          </p>
          <p>
           (b) (i) Catenation (i.e. linking of atoms of the same kind with one another) is related to the atom-atom bond energy. Greater the atom-atom bond energy, greater is the catenation. Because of low N—N bond energy (163.8 KJ mol
           <sup>
            -1
           </sup>
           ) nitrogen shows little tendency for catenation. P—P bond energy (201 × 10
           <sup>
            -6
           </sup>
           KJ/mol) is quite high, hence, it shows more tendency for catenation than nitrogen.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Oxygen forms pπ – pπ multiple bonds. Due to the small size and high electronegativity oxygen exists as diatomic (O
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           ) molecule. These molecules are held together by weak van der Waals’ forces. Place O
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           is a gas at room temperature.
           <br/>
           Sulphur because of its bigger size and lower electronegativity, prefer to form S—S single bonds. Further because of stronger S—S than O—O single bonds, sulphur has a much greater tendency for catenation than oxygen. Thus, sulphur because of its higher tendency for catenation and a lower tendency for pπ-πn multiple bonds, forms octa atomic (S
           <sub>
            8
           </sub>
           ) molecules, having an eight-membered puckered ring structure. Because of bigger size, the force of attraction holding the Ss molecule together are much stronger. Hence, sulphur is a solid at room temperature.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) All halogens are coloured. It is due to the reason that their molecules absorb light in the visible region as a result of which their electrons get excited to higher energy levels while the remaining light is transmitted. The colour of the halogens is actually the colour of this transmitted light.

           <br/>
           What is meant by ‘shape-selective catalysis’? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Zeolites are shaped selective catalysts and shape-selective catalysis depends upon the structure of the pores present in the catalyst and size of the reactant and product molecules. ZSM-5 is an example of a shape-selective catalyst, which is used in converting alcohol directly into gasoline.

           Question 17.
           <br/>
           Explain the cleaning action of soap. Why do soaps not work in hard water? [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When soap is rubbed on dirty cloth in water, the concentration of soap becomes greater than (CMC) critical micelle concentration, micelle formation takes place. These micelles get adsorb at the dirt or grease
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 Chemistry 2012 Outside Delhi Set II Q17" height="160" loading="lazy" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48581513566_09ee78443a_o.png" width="412"/>
           <br/>
           In such a manner that hydrophobic end get adsorbs and anionic head remains at the surface.
           <br/>
           Therefore dirt particle becomes negatively charged and when rinsing is done, this particle moves along with water and clothes become free from dirt or grease.

           Explain the following observations:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Many of the transition elements are known to form interstitial compounds.
           </li>
           <li>
            There is a general increase in density from titanium (Z = 22) to copper (Z = 29).
           </li>
           <li>
            The members of the actinoid series exhibit a larger number of oxidation states than the corresponding members of the lanthanoid series. [3]
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           Answer:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Transition elements are known to form interstitial compounds because these elements are capable of entrapping smaller atoms of other elements such as H, C and N in the interstitial sites in their crystal lattice.
           </li>
           <li>
            It is due to an increase in atomic mass whereas atomic size decreases from Ti to Cu. Therefore, density goes on increasing.
           </li>
           <li>
            Because of the comparable energies of 5f, 6d and 7s orbitals in actinoids, they exhibit a larger number of oxidation states than the corresponding members of lanthanoid series.
           </li>
          </ol>

           Answer:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Elastomers: Their polymer chain is held together by weakest intermolecular forces so that they can be stretched. That is why they exhibit elastic properties and are rubber-like solids, eg., Buna-S, Buna-N etc.
           </li>
           <li>
            Condensation Polymers: They are formed by repeated condensation reaction between two different bi or tri-functional monomeric units with the elimination of smaller molecules such as water, alcohol, HCl etc. e.g.,: Nylon 6, 6.
           </li>
           <li>
            Addition Polymers: They are formed by the repeated addition of monomer molecules having double or triple bonds, eg: Polyethylene.

           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           molecule, it is inert and hence is less reactive as compared to phosphorous which has P-P single bond, which makes it more reactive.
           <br/>
           (ii) In the case of HF, an average of two intermolecular hydrogen bonds are present. As a result, Vander Waals forces of attraction increases in the water molecule and hence, boiling point increases.
           <br/>
           (iii) Because S-S bond is stronger than 0-0 bonds as there is more interelectronic repulsion in O-O than in S-S.

           </sub>
           O.
           <br/>
           (ii) Fluorine is the most electronegative element in nature and it has no d-orbitals and therefore, there is no scope for electron promotion.
           <br/>
           Hence, it can show only -1 oxidation state in its compounds.
           <br/>
           (iii) Because it is an inert gas and has very high ionization enthalpy, therefore no real chemical compound of helium is known.

           Question 23.
           <br/>
           Explain each of the following observations: [3]
           <br/>
           (i) With the same d-orbital configuration (d
           <sup>

           (ii) Actinoids exhibit a much larger number of oxidation states than the lanthanoids.
           <br/>
           (iii) There is hardly any increase in atomic size with increasing atomic numbers in a series of transition metals.

           (i) Cr
           <sup>
            2+

           , it has three unpaired electrons in lower energy d-orbitals which are more stable whereas M
           <sup>
            3+
           </sup>
           is oxidizing because after gaining one electron it becomes Mn
           <sup>
            2+
           </sup>
           which has more stable electronic configuration due to half-filled d-orbitals Mn
           <sup>
            2+
           </sup>
           :[Ar]3d

            5
           </sup>
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Due to comparable energies of 5f, 6d and 7s orbitals and unpaired electrons in these orbitals, actinoids exhibit a much larger number of oxidation states than the lanthanoids.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Because along with transition series, nuclear charge increases which tend to decrease the size but the addition of electrons in the penultimate d-subshell increases the screening effect which counters balances the effect of increased nuclear charge. Thus, atomic radii do not change.

           (i) Peptide linkage
           <br/>
           (ii) Primary structure
           <br/>
           (iii) Denaturation.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Peptide linkage is the amide linkage between two amino acids to form proteins and polypeptides. CO-NH is a peptide linkage.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The simple linear structure of a protein molecule in a specific sequence in which various amino acids are present.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) When a protein in its native form is subjected to any physical change like change in temperature or chemical change like change in pH, the H-bonds gets disturbed. Due to this globules unfold and helix gets uncoiled and protein loses its biological activity. This is called denaturation of the protein.
