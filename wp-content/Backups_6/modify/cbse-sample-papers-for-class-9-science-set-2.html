           Question 2.
           <br/>
           During summer, water kept in an earthen pot becomes cool because of the phenomenon of: [1]
           <br/>
           (A) Diffusion
           <br/>
           (B) Transpiration

           <br/>
           (D) Evaporation
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Option (D) is correct.
           <br/>
           Explanation: It is because of the phenomenon called evaporation. An earthen pot has a large number of tiny pores in its walls and some of the water molecules continuously keep seeping through these pores to outside the pot. This water evaporates continuously and takes the latent heat required for vaporization from the remaining water. In this way, the remaining water loses heat and gets cooled.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Option (A) is correct.
           <br/>
           Explanation. Decaying of wood and burning of wood are chemical changes because in these processes, the chemical composition of wood is changed and new substances are formed. which cannot be converted back into their original form. Sawing of wood and hammering of a nail into a piece of wood are physical changes. I

           Question 6.
           <br/>
           Which condition out of the following will increase the evaporation of water? [1]
           <br/>
           (A) Increase in temperature of water
           <br/>
           (B) Decrease in temperature of water
           <br/>
           (C) Less exposed surface area of water

           (D) Adding common salt to water.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Option (A) is correct.
           <br/>
           Explanation: On increasing the temperature, kinetic energy of water molecules increases and more particles get enough kinetic energy to go into the vapour state- This increases the rate of evaporation. On the other hand, decrease in temperature of water, less exposed surface area of water, and addition of common salt to water decrease the rate of evaporation.

           Question 7.
           <br/>
           The boiling points of diethyl ether, acetone, and n-butyl alcohol are 35°C, 56°C and 118°C, respectively. Which one of the following correctly represents their boiling points in Kelvin scale? [1]
           <br/>
           (A) 306K,329K,391K
           <br/>
           (B) 308K,329K,392K
           <br/>
           (C) 308K,329K,391K
           <br/>
           (D) 329K,392K,308K
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Option (C) is correct.
           <br/>
           Explanation: On applying the formula,
           <br/>
           T°C + 273 = K,
           <br/>
           The boiling point of diethyl ether 35°C + 273 = 308 K
           <br/>
           Boiling point of acetone = 56° C + 273 = 329 K
           <br/>
           and Boiling point of n-butvl alcohol = 118°C+273 = 391K.
           <br/>
           Hence, the correct order of boiling points in Kelvin scale is 308 K, 329 K, and 391 K.

           <br/>
           (D) Intercalary meristem
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Option (B) is correct.
           <br/>
           Explanation: Girth of the Stem increases due to lateral meristematic tissue. They are found beneath the bark (called cork cambium) and in vascular bundles of dicot roots and sterns (called vascular cambium) as thin layers. This increase in the diameter or girth of the plant is called secondary growth.

           Calculate the average speed of the bus.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Average speed = \(\frac{\text { Total distance covered }}{\text { Total Time taken }}\)
           <br/>
           Here is the total distance covered
           <br/>
           35 km +60 km + 40 km 135 km
           <br/>
           Total time taken = 3 hours
           <br/>
           Therefore.
           <br/>
           Average speed = \(\frac{135}{3} \) = 45 km/hr
           <br/>
           Hence, the average speed of the bus is 45 knVhr.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           We know that potential energy RE. is given by formula,
           <br/>
           P.E. = mgh
           <br/>
           Therefore, at height 5 cm
           <br/>
           P.E. = 0.1 kg × 10 m/s
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
           × 0.05m
           <br/>
           P.E. = 0.05 J
          </p>
          <p>
           Now, at point A,
           <br/>
           Total energy = P.E. + K.E.
           <br/>
           E = 0.05 + 0 = 0.05 J (As the bob starts (rom
           <br/>
           rest, K.E. will be zero.)
          </p>
          <p>
           Now, at point P (at height 2cm),
           <br/>
           P.E = 0.1 kg ×10 m/s
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
           × 0.02 m
           <br/>
           P.E = 0.02 J
           <br/>
           Now
           <br/>
           K.E. = Total energy -PE.
           <br/>
           K.E. = 0.05-0.02 = 0.03 J
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           When an object is immersed in the fluid name the two forces acting on it are downward gravitational force and upward buoyant force.

           There are. two elements A and B. Find the number of sub-atomic particles in each of these elements. What is the relationship between the two elements?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The physical state of matter can be changed by changing the pressure. By lowering the temperature and increasing the pressure, gases can be changed into liquids and some solids can be changed into gases on decreasing the pressure. This happens with gases as there is lots of space between the particles of a gas and upon applying high pressure, particles come down to each other which upon cooling gets liquefied.

           Question 31.
           <br/>
           State the law of inertia. Why do we fall in forward direction if a moving bus stops suddenly and fall in the backward direction if it suddenly accelerates from rest? [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Law of inertia: An object remains in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line until an external unbalanced force acts on it. When a moving bus stops suddenly, the bus slows down but our body tends to remain in the state of motion due to inertia of motion, Sudden start of bus brings motion to the bus as well as our feet but rest of the body still has inertia of rest due to which we fall backward.

           When a solid melts the temperature of the system does not change after the melting point is reached even when we continue to supply heat because the supplied heat energy gets used up in changing the state by’ overcoming the forces of attraction between the particles.

           Thus, when the distance between the objects is reduced to half, the gravitational force increases by four times the original force
           <br/>
           F=GM x \(\frac{4 \mathrm{~m}}{\mathrm{R}^2}\) =4F
           <br/>
           So, as the mass of any one of the objects is increased four times, the force is also increased by four times.

           (a) Which of the elements A, B, C, D will tend to form a cation?
           <br/>
           (b) Which of the above elements is a noble gas?
           <br/>
           (c) Which of the elements A, B, C, and D will tend to form an anion? [4]

           Which two elements are isobars of each other?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Element B has number of protons greater than number of electrons. So, it will tend to form a cation.
           <br/>
           (b) The atomic number of element D is 18. So, its electronic configuration will be 2. 8, 8. The outermost shell is complete, so, it is a noble gas.
           <br/>
           (c) Element A has number of electrons greater than number of protons. So, it will tend to form an anion.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Element D and E both have same mass number, i.e., 40 but different atomic numbers so they are isobars of each other.

           <br/>
           which part helps in growth and development of plant’s girth?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The diagram shows meristematic tissues.
           <br/>
           (b) Meristem present at the growing tips of stem and root is called apical meristem. It brings about increase in length of the stem and the root.
           <br/>
           (c) Intercalary meristem is found at the base of leaves and internodes.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Meristem located on the lateral portion of plant (lateral meristem) is responsible for increasing the girth of root and stem.

           <br/>
           What is the frequency of a sound wave? [4]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Amplitude = Maximum displacement = 12 cm
           <br/>
           (b) Frequency (n) = 200 Hz, Wavelength (λ)= 0.36m,
           <br/>
           Now, ν = nλ
           <br/>
           ν = 200Hz × 0.36m
           <br/>
           ν=72m/s
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) Wavelength = Distance between two crests = 36 cm = 0.36m
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           The frequency of a sound wave is the number of oscillations per second.
