           Sebastian Shultz was the second Sheriff in the Dragon Quest
          </p>

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>

          </p>
          <p>
           (c) Was the idea a good one, and did it eventually succeed? How?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The idea was good, but it did not succeed, for Sebastian Shultz had slipped and was tumbling back through the air, down the concrete below.

           Question 3.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer the following questions briefly.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           (a) Why did the news of the ‘miracle recovery’ shock Michael?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Michael was shocked by the news of the miracle recovery for he thought that Sebastian Shultz couldn’t be the boy he had met. Six weeks ago he was badly injured in a motorway accident, his condition in the hospital was described as critical though stable. Sebastian didn’t regain consciousness. His parents were informed that the boy was in a coma.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Michael’s meeting with Sebastian Shultz had been a chance meeting. Where had it taken place and how?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Michael met Sebastian Shultz by chance through the computer game, when Sebastian Shultz was badly injured. His memory was saved in a computer when he banged his head during the accident. When Michael played the game, he entered into Sebastian’s memory and so he met him.
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) What kind of computers fascinated Michael and his dad? Why?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Michael and his dad were fascinated by computers that had got a Pentium 150 Mhz processor, with 256 of RAM, a 1.2 Gb hard disk drive and 16 speed CD ROM, complete with speakers, printer, modem and scanner, because it could do anything. Paint, play music, create displays; even when his homework was rubbish, it looked fantastic.
          </p>
          <p>
           (d) Describe the first place where Michael was virtually transported.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Michael found himself striding down the dusty track through the centre of the town. There was a Sheriff’s badge pinned on his shirt, he was virtually transported into a saloon.
          </p>
          <p>
           (e) What help did Sebastian Shultz ask Michael for? How did he convey this message?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Sebastian Shultz asked Michael to retrieve him. As Michael slipped off the visor, the empty desert disappeared and he found himself back in the power base, then he noticed that printer had come on. At the top was a picture of the second Sheriff on the piece of paper printed over the bottom of the message PLEASE HELP TO RETRIEVE ME. TRY ‘DRAGONQUEST’ Sebastian Shultz.
          </p>
          <p>
           (f) Why did Michael fail in rescuing Sebastian Shultz the first time?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Michael failed to rescue Sebastian Shultz the first time because the second Sheriff appeared waving his arms shouting ‘don’t go out’. He was about Michael’s age though he looked like a computer image, but didn’t move like one. He told Michael to follow him. They raced down a corridor and ran, passed some men, but they ended up back in the saloon. The second Sheriff jumped on a horse and they both sped off at that moment.
          </p>
          <p>
           The gun shot echoed and the second Sheriff (Sebastian Shultz) groaned and slumped back.
          </p>
          <p>
           (g) The second attempt to rescue Sebastian Shultz too was disastrous. Give reasons.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The second attempt to rescue Sebastian Shultz too was disastrous because the aim of the game was to rescue the princess from a tall tower, but a second knight appeared from the wardrobe and told Michael, ‘It’s me who needs rescuing’. Michael saw it was Sebastian to escape from the tower Sebastian chopped off the Princess’s long plaits and with them slipped from the window down. As Michael lowered himself down, the dragon followed them and when they turned the dragon was upon them, but the dragon was only interested in Sebastian. There was nothing that Michael could do to prevent them.
          </p>
          <p>
           (h) Narrate the accident that injured Sebastian Shultz.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Sebastian Shultz was injured in a motorway accident. His condition was critical at the hospital, he did not regain consciousness, he was in a coma.
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) How had Sebastian Shultz entered the games?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When the accident occurred, Sebastian was using his laptop to play one of the same psycho­drive games that Michael had bought. When he banged his head in the accident the computer had saved his memory in its own.
          </p>
          <p>
           (j) How was Sebastian Shultz’s memory stored on Michael’s disk? How did Michael discover that?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Sebastian Shultz’s memory was stored in Michael’s disk while he was in hospital. Someone stole Sebastian Shultz’s games and they ended up at the computer fair from where Michael’s father bought them. So, he restored in his disk when he played them. Sebastian Shultz had a close brush with death. After he had recovered, he returned to school and narrated his experience to his classmates. Yes Michael’s discovered that.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Sebastian Shultz had a close brush with death. After he recovers, he returns to school and narrates his experience to his classmates. As Sebastian Shultz, narrate your experience.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           I was badly injured in a motorway accident. I was rushed to the general hospital, where the doctors said I was critical but stable. I did not regain consciousness. I was in a coma.
          </p>
          <p>
           The doctors tried their best. The coma could last forever. My parents were worried. Everyone who knew me was praying for my recovery. A miracle was needed. Suddenly, I came out of coma and this was a shocking news. The news appeared as the headlines in a newspaper. When the accident occurred, I banged my head against the laptop on which I was playing in the car. My memory was saved in the computer. When Michael played the game, he entered in my memory. Michael had bought the games from the computer fair.
          </p>
          <p>
           Someone had stolen these games from my house. Michael got messages from me that I wanted to be rescued. He was the second Sheriff and the knight (myself) was the boy from the game. Michael had seen the proof in the newspaper. Michael had saved me.
          </p>

           Answer:
           <br/>
           Sebastian Shultz was injured in a motorway accident. His head had banged against the laptop on which he was playing a game when the accident occurred. His memory got transferred to the computer. At the time of the accident, Sebastian was playing the same Psycho Drive game that Michael had. The computer had saved Sebastian memory in its own. Michael wondered how Sebastians memory could come on his computer. He remembered Mr. Shultz had said to one of the reporters that they were off to pile up some games. It was while they were in the hospital, that someone stole the lot. He didn’t know what happened to them. Michael said that the games ended . up at the computer fair and they bought them. Michael received a message from Sebastian that he was not sure how it all happened. He thanked Michael for saving his life and wanted to meet him. Sebastian after a long coma recovered, everything that had been described was virtually true. Michael and Sebastian would surely meet in real life as friends and would try to re-enter the virtual world together.

          <p>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           It is a true story and could happen to anyone one day, but computer games, if played in excess may harm one. Too much, time is wasted and the person starts leading a sedentary life. The games cause addiction and they have negative impact on health. Too much addiction to computer makes a person suffer from psychological imbalance. Sebastian hit his head against the computer while being driven in a car. This addiction of playing computer games made him suffer for life. Computer games promote violence and aggression, they reduce one’s social skills and detach one from reality.

          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>
            Virtual Games are a Reality
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           The opinions whether computer games are biased or not is a matter of serious consideration. Let’s know miore about these games. Virtual games are a fad among teenagers as well as adults and are played in a computer simulated environment that can simulate physical presence in places in the real world or imagined worlds. Most of these games include visual experiences, displayed on a computer screen, sensory information through headphones, etc. These games make use of standard input devices like keyboard and mouse or multi-modal devices such as a wired glove and omni-directional treadmills. While playing, the player feels himself/herself to be inside the scene with the action going all round. Virtual reality may impact human life and activity significandy. It enables heritage sites to be recreated extremely accurately, develops virtual replicas of caves and monuments. It has therapeutic uses also like treatment of different phobias and to treat the patients who are in another location by projecting a 3-D avatar of the therapist to treat the patient. However, these games have a dark side also. The adrenaline rush that occurs while playing, can alter the behaviour of the player negatively. These games involve a high degree of ‘immersion and the boundary between real and virtual life gets blurred. In order to harness the full benefits of virtual reality, one should be sensitized, to warn off the possible dangers.

           (a) to apply mathematical formulae
          </p>
          <p>
           5. Once inside a three-dimensional representation of an anatomical structure, surgeons can
           <br/>
           (a) ‘move’ through and ‘peel away’ its layers
           <br/>
           (b) shrink themselves and travel inside the body parts
           <br/>
           (c) convert the data into a flat picture for detailed study
           <br/>
           (d) locate the diseased parts of the body quickly
           <br/>
           Answer:

           (a) travel inside the eye of his patient
           <br/>
           (b) identify the scar tissue growing over the retina
           <br/>
           (c) go inside the layers of the retina
           <br/>
           (d) isolate the ridge of the scar tissue
           <br/>
           Answer:
