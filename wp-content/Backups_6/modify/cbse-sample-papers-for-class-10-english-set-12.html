           Reading Comprehension Through Unseen Passages
           <br/>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the following text. (10)
           <br/>
           1. It is common knowledge that school children are under great pressure to perform well in all fields, study ten subjects, play games and develop an impressive image. How do they manage? The skills, techniques and principles which they pick up while still young help them cope.
          </p>
          <p>
           2. Two of twentieth century’s finest minds have lamented that schools are not teaching the basics of personal excellence or the science of success. ‘Almost all of what a child learns at school after the age often is totally irrelevant to his need in later life. Most schools do not teach thinking at all.” We need to understand that management must be taught as a school subject. The weightiest argument is that children are managers.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           3. Many of children are called upon to play directly three of the interpersonal roles: ‘Figurehead’, ‘Leader’ and ‘Liaison Officer’. They do this while assisting teachers as monitors or group leaders, while captaining teams on playgrounds and while leading teams in competitions. Many more play these roles as surrogates.
          </p>
          <p>
           4. The decision role of ‘Entrepreneur’ and ‘Resource Allocator’ may only occasionally be assigned to children. However, it is worth noting that, according to a recent survey in , Delhi, a monthly allocation of up to ₹ 1000 is available as pocket money to school children. Therefore, they too need to have control over money and to develop a sense of budget. If we add to these financial resources to the resources of time, information and intellect available to children, we find that the decision making roles are not irrelevant to them. Children play the other two decision roles: ‘Disturbance Handler’ and ‘Negotiator’ more often.
          </p>
          <p>
           5. Children are managers in the making: Many of the management habits (e.g., using a to-do list), management skills (e.g. sensitive listening), management attitudes and values are formed early in life. Personality theorists believe that it is extremely difficult to change personality traits, styles of thinking and habits of behavior once they are formed.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           6. As in language learning, where basic and abstract aspects of language like pronunciation and rhythm are extremely resistant to learning after puberty, good management habits, attitudes and values are difficult to acquire in adulthood. Computer skills, lateral thinking and swimming, often felt to be forbidden by adults are easily learnt by children. In fact, both research evidence and specialists strongly support the view that children’s ability to learn skills like swimming and creative thinking is much more developed than adults. Equally important, complex organisms (a) learn what is necessary or pleasurable and (b) adapt themselves in ways that will serve their needs and interests with amazing
           <br/>
           enthusiasm, ease and effectiveness.
          </p>
          <p>

           <br/>

          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Read the following text. (10)
           <br/>
           India is home to 18 percent of the global population but has only 4 percent of the global water resources. Its per capita water availability is around 1,100 cubic meter (m
           <sup>
            3
           </sup>
           ), well below the internationally recognised threshold of water stress of 1,700 m
           <sup>
            3
           </sup>
           per person and dangerously close to the threshold for water scarcity of 1,000 m
           <sup>
            3
           </sup>
           per person.
          </p>
          <p>
           Paradoxically, India is also the largest net exporter of virtual water (the amount of water required to produce the products that India exports) and has one of the most water-intense economies. Despite looming water scarcity, India is one of the largest water users per unit of GDP suggesting that the way in which India manages its water resources accounts for much of its water woes. The problem lies with the government capacities which are lacking in improving water management, while policies and incentives often favor inefficient and unproductive use of water. This coupled with weak or absent institutions (e.g. for water regulation) and poor data collection and assessment results in the increasing state of water woes in the country.
          </p>
          <p>
           When it comes to improving water service delivery, India can learn from Brazil, Colombia, Mozambique and New South Wales (Australia). We don’t even have to go overseas to see good examples of water resources management. The Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority, established under a World Bank project, is putting in place policies, regulations, institutions and incentives that promote more efficient and more productive use of water. Efforts to establish effective authorities are also underway in other states and Maharashtra is disseminating the lessons learned from its experience.
          </p>
          <p>
           Further, the World Bank’s Country Partnership Framework for India recognises the importance of the efficient use of natural resources, including water, in support of the country’s ambitious growth targets. Several World Bank projects support India’s efforts in the water sector: Through the National Mission for Clean Ganga, the World Bank is helping the Government of India build institutional capacity for the management and clean-up of the Ganga and investing to reduce pollution.
          </p>
          <p>
           Another World Bank project, the Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project, has improved the safety and performance of 223 dams in the country. The National Hydrology Project is providing significant support to strengthen capacities, improve data monitoring and analysis and laying the foundations for benchmarking and performance-based water management. There are many more such projects that aid an efficient water management system.

          </p>
          <p>
           Sir / Ma’am
           <br/>
           This is to inform you that I am Rohan Khanna, a frequent shopper from your Supermarket. I am writing this letter to inform you that I had been billed for items I had not purchased in my last visit to the store. Yesterday, I went to your store located in Rainbow Complex and purchased a few items. However, after I returned home and noticed my bill, I was bewildered as I was billed for items that I had not purchased.
          </p>
          <p>
           I visited your shop at around 9.30 am on Sunday, 13th June 20XX and. I paid my bill to a young lady who was managing the counter. The counter was unusually busy and I did not have enough time to cross check the amount of the goods I purchased. When I got back home and studied the bill.
          </p>
          <p>
           I noticed that was charged for each item I bought. However, I was also charged it for a pair of socks, 100-gram cheese, a bottle of shampoo and one-kilo apple. I checked again whether they actually packed those items for me but they were nowhere to be found.
          </p>
          <p>
           I was overcharged 670 rupees for the items I had not purchased. I am attaching the receipt for your ‘ consideration and would like you to refund my amount next time I visit your store. A mistake like this is not acceptable from a shop like yours. Please take the necessary steps to rectify this error and make sure it does not happen again.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           Thanking you

           Answer:
           <br/>
           A. What do you Watch?
           <br/>
           With the rise in streaming applications and websites such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc. there is no need to investigate the new trend of binge watching. Researchers today are more focused on understanding the behaviour of binge-watching. The given graph depicts one such research in which the various themes and categories of movies are scaled between their streaming times. Overall, the ‘ graph points out that people love to watch shows that are mysterious and thrilling.
          </p>
          <p>
           People love to watch thrillers, sci-fi and horror movies and shows while slow dramas such as irreverent comedies, political dramas and historical dramas are preferred by only some people. The latter category of movies have been streamed by people for less than 2 hours while the former has been devoured for more than 2 hours. People also like to stream Superhero Dramas, Crime Dramas, Dramatic Comedies and Action and Adventure. All these categories’are streamed for about 2 hours. From this given data, we can understand that people binge-watch shows that cater to their senses. Something that excites them and creates a curiosity is loved by everyone and so is more popular.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           B. Commuting Trends
           <br/>
           With modern ideas, modern life also came where commuting to work became easier. But in the 90’s and early 2000’s, the modes.of transport were erratic. The bar chart shows the changing patterns of transport use during the period from 1980 to 2018. In brief, the chart shows that the use of car as a means of commuting dramatically increased over the period shown, while the use of other modes fell.
          </p>
          <p>
           In 1980, the motor car was used the least as a means of commuting with only about 7% of the population using it but its use grew steadily to finally reach about 37% of the population using it by 2018. Over the same period, the popularity of walking, which had been the most popular means of commuting with 35% of the population in 1980, fell to 10%.
          </p>
          <p>
           Use of motor also fell from a high of about 27% in 1980 to just 7% in 2018. On the other hand, bus use was more erratic being popular with almost 20% of the population in 1980 and rising to a peak of about 27% in 2010 before falling back to about 18% in 2018.

This loss will lead to the loss of childhood as the boy learns to take responsibility. The boy now understands that loss is a part of life and one must move on from it. This realisation makes the boy grow up and lose the childhood days that he had cherished till now.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           While looking outside from the window of the train, Rajvir saw greenery all around. First he saw the green paddy (rice) fields which gave way to the tea bushes. Against the backdrop of densely wooded hills, he saw a sea of tea gardens that were pruned to the same height. The beautiful view amazed and fascinated him.

           Clues Held by inner conscience; Didn’t want to lose Anil’s trust, Prospect of getting educated
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Hari Singh did not catch the train deliberately because his inner conscience held him back.
           <br/>
           He thought that Anil would feel sad not for the loss of money but for the loss of trust he had reposed in him. Moreover, he did not want to lose the chance of learning as his inner self was transformed.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When the teacher asked her name, ij-lholi stammered and could not tell her name completely to her teacher. So, she broke into tears and kept her head down as the other girls in the classroom were laughing at her.
          </p>

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The rhyme ‘Humpty Dumpty’ makes Think Tank scream. He interprets the words ‘had a great fall’ and thinks that the earthlings are planning to capture Mars Central Control and him. As a result he orders his crew to prepare a space Capsule for him to escape.

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Answer ANY ONE of the following two questions, in about 100-120 words, (1 × 6 = 6)
           <br/>
           A. You have been chosen to address a gathering of the members of your residential society, to speak on the principle ‘Forgive and forget help in maintaining cordial relations with neighbours’. Prepare the speech based on the play The Proposal.
           <br/>
           Or ‘
           <br/>
           B. The dragon, Custard was considered a coward. The humble dragon proved his bravery in adversity. Analyse that certain qualities like bravery and courage are situational and spontaneous. Express your views with reference to the poem,
           <br/>
           The Tale of Custard, the Dragon.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A. Good morning, everyone!
           <br/>
           Today, I would like to speak on the principle of ‘forgive and forget’ and how it helps in maintaining cordial relations with neighbours. I read a play titled ‘The Proposal’ recently which highlighted this principle.
          </p>
          <p>
           Initially, the neighbours in the play-Lomov, Natalya and Chubukov were fighting over petty issues.
           <br/>
           By doing this, they were putting important issues behind them and were wasting their time by arguing over petty issues. These arguments slowly developed into fights and as a result they damaged their relationships with each other. It was only when Natalya came to know that Lomov had ‘come to her house to propose her that she left the topic of argument (Oxen Meadows) behind. Eventually, she asked for forgiveness from Lomov and requested him to come to the point.
          </p>
          <p>
           From this play, I learned that it is mandatory to adopt the principle of ‘Forgive and Forget’ to maintain cordial relationship with our friends and neighbours. I hope what I said made sense with you.
           <br/>
           Thank you for your time!
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           B. It is true that bravery and courage are situational and spontaneous. This fact has been aptly conveyed in the poem “The Tale of Custard the Dragon” wherein the dragon was considered a coward. He was laughed at for crying for a nice safe cage. He never boasted of his bravery and courage, unlike Belinda and her other pets did. Everyone else, including Belinda, Ink, Blink and Mustard claimed to be brave. They even made fun of Custard’s cowardice. However, when the time to show their courage came, none of them could face the danger.
          </p>
          <p>
           They hid themselves in some corner of the house. It was only Custard who dated to face the frightening pirate. He not only fought the pirate but also ate him up. It was a dangerous situation to which Custard spontaneously responded. His courage and bravery came out in a threatening situation. Hence, it is true that qualities like courage and bravery are situational and spontaneous.

           Answer ANY ONE of the following two question, in about 100-120 words. (1 × 6 = 6)
           <br/>
           A. If somehow you discovered how tobecome invisible, how would you use that opportunity. Write a diary entry based on it and contrasting the way invisibility was used in the chapter, ‘Footprints without Feet’.

           B. Max was a cunning spy but his carelessness and foolishness proved fatal for him. Do you agree that it were these characteristics that led to his downfall?
           <br/>
           (The Midnight Visitor)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A.
           <br/>
           10th June, 20XX
           <br/>
           10:30 PM ‘
           <br/>
           Dear Diary,
           <br/>
           I just read a lesson in which a scientist becomes invisible. But you know he does all the wrong things’] and makes the life of people arourid him messy. Being a scientist, he shou’ieH’t have done all this but that’s how the story goes. ”
          </p>
          <p>
           If I discovered how to become invisible, I would use this opportunity to punish aft those people who cause trouble for others for their own selfish motives. I would catch them and hand them over to the police. Apart from this, I would also help law-enforcing agencies when they conduct raids on the criminal hideouts as I will be able to move in the open without fear of being seen. !
          </p>
          <p>
           According to me if we are blessed with a power, we should fulfill some responsibilities towards our society, our nation and the world. I don’t want to become a devil by misusing my power!
           <br/>
           Take care!
           <br/>
           Prisha
          </p>
          <p>
           Or
           <br/>
           B. Yes, I agree that carelessness and foolishness led to the downfall of Max. Though Max was a – cunning secret agent, he was indeed careless and foolish. He was overconfident and proud which failed his mission. As a clever spy, Max was sent on an important mission of procuring a vital document on the new missiles from his rival, Ausable. But, tie was deceived.
          </p>
          <p>
           Max’s pride and foolishness led to his downfall. He, in his carelessness, did not take any pains to inspect the hotel as well as Ausable’s room in advance. Consequently, when Ausable tells him about a balcony outside his window and the police knocking fet the door, Max believes him withoutfeny doubt. He trusted his rival blindly without applying his mind and as a result, failed himself as well as his mission.
          </p>
          <p>
           Unlike him, Ausable’s calmness and presence of mind saved him, his guest Fowler and the important papers he was about to receive. He set up a successful trap by putting up very little efforts. Max foolishly fell into this trap. This carelessness and foolishness rendered him to be a little spy before Ausable and also cost him his life.
