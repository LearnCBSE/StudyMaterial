           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Discuss the following questions in detail and write the answers in your notebooks :
          </p>
          <p>
           (a) Do you think the tiger shooting organized by the villagers was a serious affair ? Give f reasons for your answer.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The tiger shooting organised by the villagers was a serious affair because Mrs. Packletide had offered a thousand rupees for the opportunity of shooting a tiger without taking much risk. A neighbouring village was chosen for the game killing. The idea of earning a thousand rupees had egged on the villagers. They had posted their children at the borders of the local jungle to head the tiger back to the village so that it may not go to some fresh hunting grounds.
          </p>
          <p>
           Mrs. Packletide was compelled to do this as the idea of her friend Loona Bimberton boasting of her personally procuring a tiger-skin and popularity of the press photographs could not be digested. Mrs. Packletides movements and motives were largely governed by the dislike of ‘ Loona Bimberton.
          </p>
          <p>
           Cheaper kind of goats were left about in a great number to keep the tiger satisfied. All precautions were taken so as not to drive the tiger away. A platform was constructed in a conveniently placed tree. Mis. Packletide even paid her companion Miss Mebbin to accompany her to the shoot. For the villagers it seemed to be a serious affair for as soon as the rifle flashed and the beast rolled over dead, a crowd of excited natives came to the place shouting happily and carried the news to the village. They were anxious for their thousand rupees. Mrs. Packletide faced the cameras with a light and a happy heart.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Do you think the writer is trying to make fun of the main characters in the story i.e. Mrs. Packletide, Miss Mebbin and Loona Bimberton ? Pick out instances from the story that point to this fact.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           This story is full of humour. The writer has tried to make fun of the society through the characters of the three women in the story. The competitive and jealous nature of Mrs. Packletide motivated her to game killing because her friend Loona Bimberton had procured a tiger-skin and procured press photographs. Mrs. Packletide had even offered a thousand rupees for this game without taking any risk and faced the cameras happily showing that she had killed that beast but the fact was the tiger had died of heart failure due to the loud sound of the rifle.          ‘
          </p>
          <p>
           Miss Mebbin was hired by Mrs. Packletide to accompany her to the game, she had a protective attitude towards money and was greedy. She even made fun of Mrs. Packletide by saying “If it is an old tiger you ought to get it cheaper”. Louisa Mebbin had blackmailed Mrs. Packletide into buying her a pretty cottage for not letting out the secret that the wrong animal had been killed. The writer makes fun of Mebbin that she had named her cottage as “Les Fauves”.
          </p>
          <p>
           Loona Bimberton has been presented as a shrewd person with a spiteful nature. She had boasted about the tiger-skin but had refused to look at the illustrated paper for weeks for it contained the pictures of Mrs. Packletide with her hunted tiger. Her emotions seemed to be repressed as she wrote the letter of thanks for the gift of a tiger claw-brooch. The writer has tried to make fun of three women who tried in their own way to get popularity.
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) A person who is vain is full of self importance and can only think of himself / herself and can go to great lengths to prove his / her superiority. Do you think Mrs. Packletide is vain ? Give reasons in support of your answer.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Mrs. Packletide is a vain. It was not because of her pleasure that she should shoot a tiger nor the lust came upon her. But her friend Loona Bimberton boasted about getting a tiger skin and facing the cameras had made Mrs. Packletide envious of her friend. The urge to face the camera herself forced her to offer a thousand rupees for the chance of shooting a tiger without much effort. She was competitive in nature which made her arrange for the shoot. She had already arranged a lunch in honour of Loona Bimberton and even planned to give her a tiger claw-brooch. She wanted to show her superiority by herself shooting a tiger so that she should also face the camera. She tried to go to any lengths to prove this. She arranged for a paid companion to accompany her for the shooting. All possible efforts were made to make it a success. Even though the wrong animal was killed she faced the camera boldly with the dead tiger to prove her courage.

           (d) Sometimes writers highlight certain negative aspects in society or human beings by making fun of it. This is called satire. In your groups discuss whether you would classify this story as a satire. Give reasons to support your answer.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The writer has used satire in the story. He has made fun of the characters in the story to bring out the satire. Mrs. Packletide is a shrewd and competitive person, she becomes jealous of her friend when she comes to know that Loona Bimberton has got a tiger-skin and faced the press and procured photographs. She too out of her pride arranges to shoot a tiger. She goes to the length of offering money to the villagers. An old tiger is lured by cheaper goats.
          </p>
          <p>
           The writer uses satire to make fun of the society that would do anything in order to become famous as portrayed by Mrs. Packletide. The other side of the greedy society is reflected by Miss Mebbin. She is a greedy lady who blackmails Mrs. Packletide to buy her a cottage so that she would not give away the secret of the wrong animal being killed. The villagers represent another group of the society who are also greedy for money. For them money mattered more than the animal that was shot, whether it was the goat or a tiger.
          </p>
          <p>
           (e) How does the writer create humour in this story ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The story is full of humour. Mrs. Packletide arranges for the shooting. The funniest part is that a weak tiger is arranged and cheaper goats are left to lure him. Mrs. Packletide is not a good shooter but a platform is constructed in a tree and she sits there with a rifle a thumb- nail pack of patience cards. The funniest part is as soon as the tiger caught sight of the goat it lay flat on the earth, seemingly less from a desire to take advantage of and attack its prey.
          </p>
          <p>
           The rifle is shot with a loud bang and the great beast springs to one side and then rolls over dead. Miss Mebbin makes fun of Mrs. Packletide by bringing out the fact that the wrong animal had been killed. The bullet had hit the goat but the tiger had a heart failure because of the loud noise of the rifle. The villagers shouted happily for they were only anxious for their thousand rupees and gladly connived at the fiction that she had shot the tiger. Mrs. Packletide faced the cameras happily and her pictured feme reached the pages of Texas Weekly Snapshot.

           Question 6.
           <br/>
           There are many amusing lines in the story. Here are a few of them. Rewrite each one in ordinary prose so that the meaning is retained. One has been done for you as an example:
           <br/>
           (a) It was Mrs. Packletide’s pleasure and intention that she should shoot a tiger.
           <br/>
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            Mrs. Packletide wanted to shoot a tiger
           </span>
           <br/>
           (b) Mrs. Packletide had already arranged in her mind the lunch she would give at her house in Curzon Street, ostensibly in Loona Bimberton’s honour, with a tiger-skin rug occupying most of the foreground and all of the conversation.
           <br/>
           (c) Mothers carrying their babies home through the jungle after the day’s work in the fields hushed their singing lest they might curtail the restful sleep of the venerable herd-robber.
           <br/>
           (d) Louisa Mebbin adopted a protective elder-sister attitude towards money in general, irrespective of nationality or denomination.
           <br/>
           (e) Evidently the wrong animal had been hit, and the beast of prey had succumbed to heart-failure, caused by the sudden report of the rifle, accelerated by senile decay.
           <br/>
           (f) As for Loona Bimberton, she refused to look at an illustrated paper for weeks, and her letter of thanks for the gift of a tiger-claw brooch was a model of repressed emotions.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (b) Mrs. Packletide had planned to give a lunch at her house in Curzon Street in honour of Loona Bimberton showing everyone the tigers skin rug hat she had.
           <br/>
           (c) In order not to disturb the tiger, mothers tried to keep their babies quiet.
           <br/>
           (d) Louisa Mebbin cared a lot for money irrespective of anything.
           <br/>
           (e) Mrs. Packletide hit the wrong animal and the tiger died of heart failure because of the loud noise of the rifle.
           <br/>
           (f) Loona Bimberton was jealous to see Mrs. Packletide with the dead tiger. She unwillingly wrote a letter of thanks to her for the gift of a tiger-claw brooch.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 7.
           <br/>
           An oxymoron is a figure of speech that combines normally-contradictory terms. The most common form of oxymoron involves an adjective-noun combination of two words like—failed success.
          </p>
          <p>
           Writers often use an oxymoron to call attention to an apparent contradiction. For example, Wilfred Owen’s poem The Send-off refers to soldiers leaving for the front line, who “lined the train with faces grimly gay.” The oxymoron ‘grimly gay’ highlights the contradiction between how the soldiers feel and how they act: though they put on a brave face and act cheerful, they feel grim. Some examples of oxymorons are—dark sunshine, cold sun, living dead, dark light, almost exactly etc.
          </p>
          <p>
           The story ‘Mrs. Packletide’s Tiger’ has a number of oxymorons. Can you identify them and write them down in your notebooks?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Oxymorons : morbid dread, sympathetic hands, laud report, glad news, pardonably annoyed, disagreeably pleasant, gladly connived.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           My friend Loona procured a tiger skin and so she got all the honour at the press. I was jealous of her and thought of getting a tiger skin myself. I asked the villagers to make all the arrangements for killing a tiger and agreed to pay them one thousand rupees. I forced my friend Mebbin to accompany me for the hunt. We both sat on a platform placed in a tree. I pointed my gun at the goat tied under the opposite tree. As soon as the tiger approached clumsily, I shot at him. It sprang on one side and fell down dead. The villagers shouted with joy. But Mebbin told me that instead of eating the goat, the tiger had died due to the loud sound of the bullet. I had missed the aim, Mebbin was cunning to blackmail me in buying her a summer cottage that she so much desired for not letting out the secret of the hunt. I was able to get the tiger skin but had to pay a huge price to outdo a rival.
