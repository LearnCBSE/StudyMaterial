           <strong>
            1.Energy Flow
           </strong>
           <br/>
           (i)Sun is the only source of energy for all the ecosystems on earth, except for deep sea hydrothermal ecosystem.
           <br/>
           (ii)Of the total incident solar radiation, less than 50% is Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR).
           <br/>
           (iii)Plants capture only 2-10% of the PAR and this small amount of energy sustains the entire living world.
           <br/>
           (iv)There is unidirectional flow of energy from the sun to producers and then to consumers. This indicates the first law of thermodynamics.
           <br/>
           (v)Ecosystem needs a constant supply of energy to synthesise the molecules they require, to counteract the universal tendency towards increasing disorderliness. This indicates the second law of thermodynamics.
           <br/>
           (vi) In an ecosystem, major producers are green plants, i.e. herbaceous and woody plants. In aquatic ecosystem, the producers constitute phytoplanktons, algae and higher plants.
           <br/>
           (vii) There are various types of food chains that operate in an ecosystem:
           <br/>
           (a)
           <strong>
            Grazing Food Chain
           </strong>
           (GFC) starts with green plants called producer at first trophic level.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            In an aquatic ecosystem, the GFC is the major channel for energy flow.
           </li>
           <li>
            Energy for food chain comes from sun.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           A simple Grazing Food Chain (GFC) is depicted below:
          </p>
          <p>
           Grass ———- &gt; Goat —————— &gt; Men
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           (Producer)             (Primary consumer) (Secondary consumer)
           <br/>
           (b)
           <strong>
            Detritus Food Chain
           </strong>
           (DFC) starts with dead organic matter with decomposers called saprophytes at first trophic level, e.g. bacteria and fungi.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            A much large fraction of energy flows through this type of food chain.
           </li>
           <li>
            Energy for the food chain comes from organic remain or detritus.
           </li>
           <li>
            Detritus food chain may be connected with the grazing food chain at some levels, forming a food web.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (viii) All animals are consumers or heterotrophs. If they feed on the producers they are called
           <strong>
            primary
           </strong>
           <strong>
            consumers
           </strong>
           , e.g. insects, birds, mammals and molluscs.
           <br/>
           (ix)The consumers that feed on herbivores (primary consumers) are called primary
           <strong>
            carnivores
           </strong>
           or
           <strong>
            secondary consumers
           </strong>
           . The animals that eat primary carnivores are called secondary carnivores.
           <br/>
           (x)
           <strong>
            Food web
           </strong>
           forms in an ecosystem, when a number of food chains interconnect with each other forming a web-like pattern.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            In a food web, one organism can hold more than one position.
           </li>
           <li>
            The flow of energy is very difficult to calculate.
           </li>
           <li>
            It is a series of branching lines.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (xi)Trophic level is the specific place occupied by an organism in the food chain in an ecosystem.
           <br/>
           There are many trophic levels in nature:
           <br/>
           (a) Producer (first trophic level)
           <br/>
           (b)Herbivore (second trophic level)
           <br/>
           (c)Carnivore (third trophic level)
           <br/>
           (d) Top carnivore (fourth trophic level)
           <br/>
           <img alt="important-questions-for-class-12-biology-cbse-energy-flow-and-ecological-succession-t-14-1" height="258" loading="lazy" src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/610/23122043340_ecaa32fe4a_o.png" width="651"/>
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Amount of energy decreases at successive trophic levels.
           </li>
           <li>
            Organisms at each trophic level depend on those at the lower trophic level for their energy demands
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (xii)Flow of energy through different trophic levels, i.e. from producers to top carnivores can be easily depicted on the basis of the diagram given below:
           <br/>
           <img alt="important-questions-for-class-12-biology-cbse-energy-flow-and-ecological-succession-t-14-2" height="410" loading="lazy" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5712/23122042970_8a128ffa73_o.png" width="815"/>
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Each trophic level has a certain mass of living material at a particular time called the standing crop.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Standing crop is measured as the mass of living organism (biomass) or the number in a unit area. ‘
           </li>
           <li>
            The number of trophic levels in the grazing food chain is restricted as the transfer of energy follows 10% law, i.e. only 10% energy is transferred to euch trophic level from he lower tn hie level
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           <strong>
            2.Ecological pyramid
           </strong>
           is the graphical representation of relation between producers and consumers in the form of pyramid.
           <br/>
           (i) In pyramid structure, the base (broader) always represents the producers or the first trophic level and the apex (narrower) represents top level consumer or last trophic level.
           <br/>
           (ii) Types of ecological pyramids:
           <br/>
           (a)
           <strong>
            Pyramid of number
           </strong>
           represents the relationship in terms of numbers, between the producers and consumers in an ecosystem. It can be:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Upright, e.g. in grassland ecosystem
           </li>
           <li>
            Inverted, e.g. in tree ecosystem
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           <img alt="important-questions-for-class-12-biology-cbse-energy-flow-and-ecological-succession-t-14-3" height="242" loading="lazy" src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/663/23049840129_f1d6af22b8_o.png" width="833"/>
           <br/>
           (b)Pyramid of biomass represents the relationship between producers and consumers in terms of biomass. It can be:
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Upright, e.g. in grasslands ecosystem
           </li>
           <li>
            Inverted, e.g. in pond ecosystem
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           <img alt="important-questions-for-class-12-biology-cbse-energy-flow-and-ecological-succession-t-14-4" height="268" loading="lazy" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5800/23391655166_fc4ab4f12d_o.png" width="797"/>
           <br/>
           (c)Pyramid of energy states the relationship between the producers and consumers in an ecosystem in terms of flow of energy. It is always upright because the energy is lost as heat at each step
           <br/>
           <img alt="important-questions-for-class-12-biology-cbse-energy-flow-and-ecological-succession-t-14-5" height="178" loading="lazy" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5645/23049839609_eb7ccf1ca6_o.png" width="670"/>
           <br/>
           (iii)A given species may occupy more than one trophic level in the same ecosystem at the same time, e.g. a sparrow is a primary consumer when it eats seeds, fruit, peas and a secondary consumer when it eats insects and worms.
           <br/>
           (iv)Ecological pyramids also have certain limitations.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            It does not take into account the same species belonging to two or more trophic levels.
           </li>
           <li>
            It assumes a simple food chain, which never exists in nature.
           </li>
           <li>
            Saprophytes/decomposers are not given any position in ecological pyramids.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           <strong>
            3.Ecological succession
           </strong>
           is a sequential, gradual and predictable change in the species composition in an area over a period of time.
           <br/>
           (i)
           <strong>
            Sere
           </strong>
           is the entire sequence of communities that successively change in a given area.
           <br/>
           (ii)
           <strong>
            Serai communities
           </strong>
           are the individual transitional communities of serai stages.
           <br/>
           (iii)
           <strong>
            Climax community
           </strong>
           is the community that is in near equilibrium with the environment.
           <br/>
           (iv)Pioneer species is the species that invade a bare area.
           <br/>
           (v)To reach a climax community, there are following changes that occur in successive serai stages:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Changes in the diversity of species of organisms.
           </li>
           <li>
            Increase in the number of species and organisms.
           </li>
           <li>
            Increase in the total biomass.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (vi)Types of ecological succession:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Primary succession
            </strong>
            begins in an area, where no living organisms are present. It is a very slow process taking thousands of years for climax to be reached.
           </li>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Secondary succession
            </strong>
            begins in an area, where natural biotic communities have been destroyed, e.g. abandoned from lands, buried or cut forests. It is a faster process as soil is available.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (vii)Succession of plants is of following types:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Hydrarch succession
            </strong>
            occurs in wet areas or water and the successional series progress from hydric to the mesic conditions.
           </li>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Xerarch succession
            </strong>
            takes place in dry areas and the series progress from xeric to mesic conditions.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Primary Succession in Water
           </strong>
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

          <ul>
           <li>

Lichens secrete acids which dissolve rocks, thereby leading to weathering and soil formation. This paves the way for small plants or bryophytes which hold the soil. They are succeeded by bigger plants and ultimately an entire forest gets established. Forests represent the climax community in this succession.

            Significance of ecological pyramids
           </strong>
           <br/>
           They graphically represent the relation between producers and consumers. To calculate energy. content, biomass or numbers, organisms of that trophic level needs to be calculated. A trophic level represents only a functional level not a species as such. A given species may occupy more than one trophic level in the same ecosystem at the same time. The ecological pyramids provide an over all idea of the trophic levels occupied by an organism in an ecosystem.
           <br/>
           Example A sparrow is a .primary consumer, when it eats seeds, fruits, peas and a secondary consumer when it eats insects and worms.
           <br/>
           (ii)
           <strong>
            Upright pyramids
           </strong>
           When producers are more in number ar d biomass than the herbivo-es and herbivores are more in  number and bionrss than the carnivores. Energy at a lower trophic level is always more than at a higher trophic level. Pyramid of energy is ah rays upright.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Inverted pyramids
           </strong>
           When the numbers of producers are less and consumers increase and become largest in top consumer level.Pyramid pf number and biomass may be inverted

           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           (i) (a) The pyramid of biomass in a ;ea ecosystem is inverted. Because, the sum total of the weight of phytoplankton (producer) is far less than a few fishes feeding at higher trophic levels.

           <br/>
           (b)Pyramid of biomass in a forest ecosystem is upright because producers are more in  biomass than primary consumers. Primary consumers are more than secondary consumers and secondary consumers are more than tertiary consumers (top).
           <br/>
           <img alt="important-questions-for-class-12-biology-cbse-energy-flow-and-ecological-succession-t-14-16" height="176" loading="lazy" src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/774/23309354522_079c479a9f_o.png" width="405"/>
           <br/>
           (ii)Pyramid of energy is neve- inverted. Because, .when energy flows from a particular trophic level to the nex. trophic level, some energy is a I wry s lost as heat at each step. Each bar in the energy pyramid indicates the amount of energy present at each trophic level in a given time.

           <br/>
           <strong>
            (ii) Why is the rate of secondary succession faster than that of primary succession? [Delhi 2010c]
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Ans
           </strong>
           .(i) Hydrarch succession occurs in wet areas,or water, leading to successional series that progress from hydric to the mesic condition.In hydrarch succession, pioneers are phytoplanktons. These phytoplanktons with time are replaced by free floating angiosperms, followed by rooted hydrophytes, sedges, grasses and finally the trees, leading to mesic condition.
           <br/>
           (ii) The secondary succession is faster than primary succession because it begins in areas where natural biotic communities have been destroyed such as abondaned farm lands, burned or cut forests. Since, some soil is present succession is faster than primary succession. At any time during primary or secondary succession, natural and human induced disturbance can convert a particular serai stage of succession to an earlier stage.

            22.Explain how xerarch succession progresses from xeric to mesic condition and form a stable climax community. You may use a flow Chart.[All India 2010 C]
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           Xerarch succession occurs in dry areas and the series progress from xeric to mesic condition. The climax community remains stable as long as environment remains unchanged. With time the xerophytic habitat gets converted into a mesophytic one.
           <br/>
           <img alt="important-questions-for-class-12-biology-cbse-energy-flow-and-ecological-succession-t-14-17" height="213" loading="lazy" src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/628/23122039220_f3cfe55865_o.png" width="366"/>
           <br/>
           It occurs in following steps as shown in flow chart:
           <br/>
           (i) Lichens secrete some acids which dissolve rocks and help in weathering and soil formation,
           <br/>
           (ii) Bryophytes invade and hold some soil.
           <br/>
           (iii) Bryophytes are succeeded by herbs, shrubs and ultimately big trees.
           <br/>
           (iv) At last, a stable climax forest is formed.
           <br/>
           (v) Finally, a xerarch condition is converted into a mesic one.

            23.All successions proceed to a similar climax community, the mesic. Explain. [HOTS; All India 2008]
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Ans
           </strong>
           .All succession proceed to a similar climax community, i.e. the mesic.
           <br/>
           (i) Succession of plants occurs as hydrarch or xerarch.
           <br/>
           (ii) Hydrarch succession occurs in water bodies and the successional series progress from hydric to mesic conditions.
           <br/>
           (iii) Xerarch succession takes place in dry areas and the series progress from xeric to mesic conditions.
           <br/>
           (iv) Hence, both xerarch and hydrarch conditions lead to medium water conditions (mesic).
           <br/>
           So, it can be said that all successions proceed to a similar complex community.
