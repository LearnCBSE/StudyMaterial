           Under this method, employees learn their jobs on the equipment they will be using, but the training is conducted away from the actual work floor. Actual work environment is created in a classroom and employees use the same materials, files and equipments. This is usually done when employees are required to handle sophisticated machinery and equipment. Vestibule training is suitable where a large number of persons are to be trained at the same time for the same kind of work. The main emphasis is on learning rather than on production.

           </strong>
           <strong>
            (Delhi 2014,2009C)
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           Training is the systematic development of knowledge, skills and attitudes required by an individual to perform adequately a given task or job. The purpose of training is to achieve a change in the -*’* behaviour of those trained and to enable them to do their jobs in a better way. Training is not a ‘one step’ process, but is a continuous or never ending process
           <br/>
           Benefits of training are as follows:
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (i) Reduced learning time
           </strong>
           A trained employee takes less time in learning the job as compared to untrained employee. As a result, there is less wastage of resources and higher productivity in organisation.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (ii) Better performance
           </strong>
           The performance of trained employees is always better than the performance of untrained employees. In the training programmes, their qualities and capabilities are improved and employees get some experience of working on the job before they are actually assigned the job. This improves their performance and efficiency level.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (iii) Attitude formation
           </strong>
           The training and development aims at moulding the employees so that they develop positive attitude for the organisation. It motivate them, to be ready to take the initiative and thus on attitude of support and cooperation exist among the employees.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (iv) Helps in solving operational problems
           </strong>
           While performing various activities, the organisation faces various problems such as problem of absenteeism, wastage of resources, dissatisfaction of employees, lack of team work, etc. Through training, these operational problems can be avoided or removed in the organisation.

           No, as per my opinion, manager’s view point is not correct. Training is beneficial for both, viz organisation and for workers.

            Training is important for an organisation
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Training is important for an organisation because of the following reasons;
           <br/>
           (i) Training of the workers leads to increase in productivity and reduction of wastages.

           <strong>
            Training is important for the employees
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The employees training in an organisation is necessary due to the following reasons (Any three)
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (i) Systematic learning
           </strong>
           Training is systematic learning, always better than hit and trial method which leads to reduction of wastage of efforts and money.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (ii) Increase in productivity
           </strong>
           A trained worker is more efficient in his work. He has better knowledge, skills and speed for his job. This leads to increase output which is profitable for the enterprise.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (iii) Fewer accidents
           </strong>
           Trained employees are proficient in handling machinery and equipment. Thus, less prone to accidents.
