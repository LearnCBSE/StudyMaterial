           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the following text. (10)
          </p>
          <p>
           1. All of Earth’s oceans share one thing in common “plastic pollution”. When people litter, or when the trash is not properly disposed off, things like plastic bags, bottles, straws, foam and beverage cups get carried to the sea by winds and waterways. About 80 per cent of ocean plastic originates on land. The rest comes from marine industries such as shipping and fishing.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           2. In 2015, engineer Jenna Jambeck at the University of Georgia and other researchers calculated that at least 8 million tons of plastic trash are swept into the ocean from coasts every year. That’s the equivalent of a full garbage truck of plastic being dumped into the sea every minute. If current trends in plastic production and disposal continue, that figure will double by 2025. A report published by the World Economic Forum last year predicts that by 2050, ocean plastic will outweigh all the fish in the sea.
          </p>
          <p>
           3. In today’s world, plastic is everywhere. It’s found in shoes, clothing, household items, electronics and more. There are different types of plastics, but one thing they all have in common is that they’re made of polymers-large molecules made up of repeating units. Their chemical structure gives them a lot of advantages: they’re cheap and easy to manufacture, lightweight, water-resistant, durable and can be moulded into nearly any shape.
          </p>
          <p>
           4. Sea turtles eat plastic bags and soda-can rings, which resemble jellyfish, their favourite food. Seabirds eat bottle caps or chunks of foam cups. Plastic pieces may make an animal feel full, so it doesn’t eat enough real food to get the nutrients it needs. Plastic can also block an animal’s digestive system, making it unable to eat.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           5. Plastic and its associated pollutants can even make it into our own food supply. Scientists recently examined fish and shellfish bought at markets in California and Indonesia. They found plastic in the guts of more than a quarter of samples purchased at both locations; in organisms that people eat whole, such as sardines and oysters, that means we’re eating plastic too. In larger fishes, chemicals from plastic may seep into their muscles and other tissues that people consume.
          </p>
          <p>
           6. One way to keep the ocean cleaner and healthier is through clean-up efforts. A lot of plastic waste caught in ocean currents eventually washes up on beaches. Removing it prevents it from blowing out to sea again. Beach clean-up is ocean clean-up.
          </p>
          <p>
           7. Clean-up efforts can’t reach every corner of the ‘ocean or track down every bit of micro-plastic’. That means it’s critical to cut down on the amount of plastic that reaches the sea in the first place. Scientists are working towards new materials that are safer for the environment. For example, Jambeck and her colleagues are currently testing a new polymer that breaks down more easily in seawater.
          </p>
          <p>
           Answer the following questions, based on the passage above.
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) Plastic is not biodegradable because it is made up of
           <br/>
           (A) low atomic particles
           <br/>
           (B) tiny particles
           <br/>
           (C) strong big particles
           <br/>
           (D) large molecule polymers
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (D) large molecule polymers
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           (ii) What is the primary source of plastic pollution in the Earth’s oceans? Answer in about 40 words.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The primary source of plastic pollution in the Earth’s oceans is land-based activities, such as littering and improper waste disposal, which contribute to about 80 percent of ocean plastic.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Complete the sentence appropriately.
          </p>
          <p>
           Plastic pollution in the oceans is primarily caused by _______ activities, which result in the accumulation of plastic waste in the marine environment.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           land – based.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) What is another term or phrase that can be used to describe the process of plastic waste being carried from land to the ocean?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Plastic migration or Plastic transport
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) Complete the sentence appropriately.
          </p>
          <p>
           Plastic pollution poses a significant threat to marine ecosystems, as approximately _______ of ocean plastic originates on land, while the remaining comes from marine industries such as shipping and fishing.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           80 percent
          </p>
          <p>
           (vi) Based on the reading of the passage, why is it important to cut down on the amount of plastic that reaches the ocean in the first place?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Cutting down on plastic reaching the ocean is crucial because plastic pollution harms marine ecosystems, endangers wildlife, and can even make its way into our own food supply, posing risks to human health.
          </p>
          <p>
           (vii) Scientists bought fish and shellfish for examination at markets in _______.
           <br/>
           (A) China and Russia
           <br/>
           (B) Pakistan and Afghanistan
           <br/>
           (C) California and Indonesia
           <br/>
           (D) Australia and Brazil
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (C) California and Indonesia
          </p>
          <p>
           (viii) Scientists are working towards new material to replace plastics. Which material is being looked for?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Material that is safer for the environment, breaks down more easily in seawater and does not harm marine life.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Read the following text. [10]
          </p>
          <p>
           1. Most of us know that smoking causes cancer, lung disease, heart disease, can shorten life by 10 years or more and can cost a smoker thousands of rupees a year. So, why are people still smoking? The answer, in a word, is addiction.
          </p>
          <p>
           2. Smoking is a hard habit to break because tobacco contains the very addictive chemical nicotine. The body and mind quickly get used to the nicotine in cigarettes. Soon, a person needs to have it just to feel normal.
          </p>
          <p>
           3. People start smoking for different reasons. Some think it looks cool. Others start because their family members or friends smoke. Almost all adult tobacco users started before they were 18 years old. Most never expected to become addicted.
          </p>
          <p>
           4. Many of the chemicals in cigarettes, like nicotine and cyanide, are poisons that can kill in high doses. The body is smart. It goes on the defence when it’s being poisoned. First time smokers often feel pain or burning in their throat and lungs, and some even cough vigorously the first few times they try tobacco. Over time, smoking leads to health problems such as heart disease, stroke, lung damage and many types of cancer — including lung, throat, stomach, and bladder cancer.
          </p>
          <p>
           5. A survey was conducted to collect views of the people whether smoking should be allowed or not in public places. The results of the responses received have been depicted in the form of pie chart here.

           (i) Complete the sentence appropriately.
          </p>
          <p>
           The body’s response to the chemicals in cigarettes, such as nicotine and cyanide, is to ___________.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           go on the defence and initiate protective measures as a response to being poisoned
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Fill in the blanks with an appropriate response.
          </p>
          <p>
           Smoking is a hard habit to break because __________.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           tobacco contains the very addictive chemical nicotine that the body and mind quickly get used to, creating a dependency on it.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Justify the following statement:
           <br/>
           “Smoking can lead to various health problems such as heart disease, stroke, lung damage, and cancer.”
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Smoking can lead to these health problems because cigarettes contain poisonous substances like nicotine and cyanide, which harm the body over time, causing damage to the heart, lungs, and increasing the risk of developing different types of cancer.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) What is the basic reason for continuing smoking even after knowing its harmful effects?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Addiction

           <br/>
           (A) Lung cancer
          </p>
          <p>
           (vii) Why do some smokers experience pain, burning sensation, and coughing when they start smoking for the first time?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When first-time smokers inhale the chemicals in cigarettes, their body’s defence mechanism is triggered, causing pain, burning sensation, and coughing. These symptoms occur as the body reacts to the toxins present in tobacco smoke
          </p>
          <p>

           Answer:
           <br/>
           Last Monday, the whole of Delhi was fast asleep. At around 11:30 p.m., it started raining slowly, but we didn’t bother and went to sleep. But it rained heavily the whole night. Again, it slowed down at around 6:00 a.m. in the morning which was under control. My mom woke me up to go to school because it had stopped raining. My school was a walking ’ distance from my home.
          </p>
          <p>
           I went hurriedly to school because the school was going to begin within 10 minutes. As we reached school, our peon and gate-keeper informed us that the school had been closed due to heavy rains. The three of us were so excited and we started shouting in happiness “Hurrah! It’s a holiday, today is a rainy day”. Again, it started raining heavily. We all started walking very slowly intentionally because we wanted to enjoy the rain and we all loved getting wet in the rain.
          </p>
          <p>
           Many small children were rowing their paper boats and dancing in happiness. We could hear birds chirping on the tree and frogs croaking behind the bushes. As I reached home, my mother came running and she helped me in changing my drenched clothes. It was a beautiful rainy day, indeed!

           ‘What is the pace of the world’ can’t be judged by a simple person. Generally, friends are considered to be the best people and friendship, the best relationship but the incident that happened today made me upset.
          </p>
          <p>
           My friend and I got a chance to drink tea in the canteen. I was glad. We were talking about various issues. All of a sudden, the behaviour of my friend changed and he said that he had heard that I had complained to the teacher against him. I assured him that I had never done such a thing but he was not ready to accept it and left the place after humiliating me. He has hurt my feelings. I am unable to find a way to solve the problem. I cannot believe that my one and only friend behaved like that. He never behaved like this before. But today I am angry and upset with him. Tomorrow, 1 will again try to make him understand.

I was served food in utensils made of gold. There were hundreds of servants and maids to attend me. They were ready to carry out my orders at the blink of an eyelid. After lunch, I had a small nap and then I started towards the forest for hunting.
          </p>
          <p>
           There were different kinds of animals in the forest. I hunted two lions which were to be displayed in my palace. All of a sudden, there was a jolt and I fell down from horseback. I began to cry. At the same time, I heard my father’s voice asking me why I was crying. I got up at once and realised that it was just a dream. I told the story to my family members. All of them began to laugh. My dream of being a king had been shattered.

           (A) “What I’ll do if I have a nightmare?” she asked. “I often have nightmares and then Grannie takes me into her bed – I can’t stay in the dark – it gets’ all whispery’…””You just go to sleep, child,” said Alice, pulling off her socks, “and don’t you scream and wake your poor Pa.” But the same old nightmare came – the butcher with a knife and a rope, who came nearer and nearer, smiling that dreadful smile, while she could not move, could only stand still, crying out, “Grandma! Grandma!” She woke shivering to see father beside her bed, a candle in his hand. “What’s the matter?” he said. Oh, a butcher – a knife – I want Grannie.” He blew out the candle, bent down and caught up the child in his arms, carrying her along the passage to the big bedroom. A newspaper was on the bed. He put away the paper, then carefully tucked up the child. He lay down beside her. Half asleep still, with the butcher’s smile all about her it seemed, she crept close to him, snuggled her head under Iris arm, held tightly to his shirt.

           (A) Sometimes we think we cannot be cheated since we consider ourselves over-smart. Was this proved correct for Gerrard in the play If I were you? Discuss the values required to be stronger and not be cheated.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           It is true that our over smartness fails sometimes.
           <br/>
           This was proved correct for Gerrard. As once, he was alone in his cottage, all of a sudden an intruder entered there. He had a revolver in his hand and he wanted to kill Gerrard. At that time, Gerrard was busy on the phone. Seeing the intruder, Gerrard did not lose his peace of mind. The intruder revealed that he was a jewel thief. He had killed a policeman and the police was after him. He wanted to avoid the police by taking Gerrard’s identity. Gerrard concocted a story and told that he too was a criminal like him. As a proof, he showed from him his travelling bag.
          </p>
          <p>
           He told the intruder that by killing him he would be accused of double murder. He told the intruder that his friend was standing below on the road. As soon as the police arrived, he would inform Gerrard. Gerrard took the intruder to the door to show the man. When they reached near the cupboard, Gerrard pushed him into the cupboard and locked it from outside. Gerrard called the police to arrest the intruder. Hence he faced the situation with courage and came out of it successfully, being calm and composed

           (B) In the poem ‘The Lake Isle of Innisfree’ what does the poet find so attractive about ‘The Lake Isle of Innisfree?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The thing that the poet finds so attractive about Lake Isle of Innisfree is its promise of peace. The poet, then, longs for this place which provides a sense of contentment and relaxation far from the busy modern life. The poem’s slow and regular meter helps to convey this languid, dreamy effect. There is also the vivid impressionistic description of the colours and beauty of this place, and the soothing stir of nature which is so different from the strident noise of the city where the poet actually is, as the final stanza makes it clear.
          </p>
          <p>
           The poet, then, is physically trapped in the city, but he can imagine the beauty of Innisfree and this gives him spiritual sustenance. This is one of Yeats’s early lyrics, exhibiting a familiar romantic sensibility in its praise of the deep purity and beauty of nature which is contrasted with the drabness, shallowness and sterility of modern urban living.

           (B) What is the meaning of “My cat was back and so was I”? Had the author gone any where? Why does he say that he is also back?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The fire had destroyed everything. The author was feeling very gloomy after the fire incident especially because his cat was found missing after that. Zan felt his cat had died in the incident because there was no news about its whereabouts. The author had lost interest in everything. When the narrator lost everything in the fire he did not cry but when he realised that his cat was missing he broke down in tears. The firemen wanted them to leave the house but he wanted to know about his cat. He used to visit this place daily hoping to see his missing cat. He kept on thinking only about her. A month later when a lady contacted him and gave him back the missing cat, he leapt up and cried out. He forgot all the loss caused by the fire and remarked, “My cat was back and so was I.”
