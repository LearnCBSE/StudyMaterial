          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the following passage.
          </p>
          <p>
           (A) Being eco-friendly is in vogue. Whether on the ramp or at home, a large number of people are emphasising the use of eco-friendly products, thereby doing their bit to protect the environment. “Eco-friendly products are those products that inflict minimal or no harm to the environment. Made of natural elements, these products are not only safe but also add an artistic dimension to one’s home”, explains C.K. Nair of Homestop.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           (B) The products are made of environment sensitive materials such as recycled wood, dead wood, recycled paper, bamboo, jute, natural fibre and natural or organic cotton. “Grasses like sabai grass and vetiver can be woven to make mats, screens, bags and baskets. Old textiles can be used to make recycled paper, which can be used for packaging, lampshades, notebooks and other stationery. Recycled plastic can be used for making containers and furniture, says “Minhazz Majumdar” of the Bamboo store. “Items like choppers, trivets, cutlery holder, spice box set, dry flower arrangements, rattan sea grass, water hyacinth baskets, cotton, linen, etc., can be made from recycled material,” says Nair.
          </p>
          <p>
           (C) Though there’s been a lot of awareness about using eco-friendly products, it is still not the first thing that people look for when buying things for their homes. Eco-friendly products not only stand out in their looks, their durability is also high. “The life cycle of these products can be up to fifty years”, says Majumdar. “With people becoming conscious about the environment, eco-friendly products will soon be considered an important aspect [in home decor],” says Angeline Loiseau of Zolijns Designs. “And what’s more, their prices may start from as low as ₹ 150,” says Nair.
          </p>
          <p>
           (D) There are many other benefits of using eco-friendly products; by using these products, you can help decrease pollution, the destruction of forests and other ecosystems, and the amount of waste sent to landfills. A simple and yet more effective way to live an eco-friendly life is to either take public transportation for your daily commuting needs, or try pooling in with your office colleagues to save fuel and reduce your carbon footprint.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           (E) In addition to this, eco-friendly products are better for your health, as they don’t contain any harmful chemicals that can irritate the skin or eyes. Another benefit of using green products is the peace of mind that you’re helping to make the planet a clean and safe place to live not only for your generation, but for generations to come!
          </p>
          <p>
           (F) Growing an eco-friendly community is getting easier. There are more and more community gardens, swap meets and farmer’s markets that make it easier for an entire community to actively participate in eco-friendly activities.
          </p>
          <p>
           (G) In this ever-evolving world, it is time we think of being eco-friendly. Our intent should be not to harm the environment through our interactions.
          </p>
          <p>
           (H) Living with an intent, goes beyond an idea, rather goes on to actual practises that is needed to influence individuals and society to conduct themselves more responsibly.
          </p>
          <p>
           (I) Being eco-friendly responsible means much more than conserving energy or separating our garbage for recycle. It is to bring a change in the way we live.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           (J) Promote and use eco-friendly products. Reduce air, water and noise pollution. These practices would improve the environment around us and human health too.
          </p>
          <p>
           Answer the following questions based on the passage above.
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) How long is the life cycle of eco-friendly products?
           <br/>
           (A) Upto 50 years
           <br/>
           (B) Upto 80 years
           <br/>
           (C) Upto 40 years
           <br/>
           (D) Upto 20 years
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (A) Upto 50 years
          </p>
          <p>
           Explanation:
           <br/>
           Eco-friendly products dissolve into nature naturally. They do not remain in waste for more than 50 years.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) List down the statements made by Minhazz Majumdar of the Bamboo store.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           “Grasses like sabai grass and vetiver can be woven to make mats, screens, bags and baskets. Old textiles can be used to make recycled paper, which can be used for packaging, lampshades, notebooks and other stationery. Recycled plastic can be used for making containers and furniture, says “Minhazz Majumdar” of the Bamboo store.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) What out of the following are eco-friendly products made of?
           <br/>
           (A) plastic grocery bags
           <br/>
           (B) bottled water
           <br/>
           (C) bamboo
           <br/>
           (D) plastic straws
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (C) bamboo
          </p>
          <p>
           Explanation:
           <br/>
           Plastic takes millions of years to dissolve. Bamboo takes hardly any time. Since bottled water is also packed in plastic bottles, it is not an eco-friendly product.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) List one benefit of using eco-friendly products.
           <br/>

          </p>
          <p>
           (v) How can you as a good citizen contribute to improve the environment?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           As a good citizen, I will promote and use eco- friendly products. I will use public transport whenever necessary and save fuel. I will encourage my friends and family to also live eco-friendly by awaring them about the various eco-friendly practices.
          </p>
          <p>
           (vi) Find the word opposite in meaning to ‘artiflcial’.

           <br/>
           (C) dry

           <br/>
           (D) Both (A) and (B)
          </p>
          <p>
           Explanation:
           <br/>
           Both natural and organic mean derived from nature. Artificial means man-made.
          </p>
          <p>
           (vii) State whether the given assertion is true or false.
          </p>
          <p>
           Being eco-friendly responsible means much more than conserving energy or separating our garbage for recycle. It is to bring a change in the way we live.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           True.
          </p>
          <p>
           Being eco-friendly responsible means much more than conserving energy or separating our garbage for recycle. It is to bring a change in the way we live.
          </p>
          <p>
           (viii) Complete the following appropriately.
          </p>
          <p>
           Based on the use of the word “durability” to describe the eco-friendly products, in paragraph 3, we can infer that eco-friendly products not only stand out in their looks, their __________ is also high.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Ability to withstand
          </p>
          <p>
           Eco-friendly products not only stand out in their looks, their ability to withstand is also high.
          </p>
          <p>
           Read the following passage.
          </p>
          <p>
           (A) In spite of all the honours that were heaped upon him, Pasteur, as it has been said, remained simple at heart. Perhaps, the imagery of his boyhood days, when he drew the familiar scenes of his birthplace and his longing to be a great artist, never wholly left him.
          </p>
          <p>
           (B) In truth, he did become a great artist, although he abandoned the brush forever after the age of 16. Like every artist of worth, he put his whole soul and energy into his work, and it was this very energy that in the end wore him out. For him, each sufferer was something more than just a case that has to be cured. He looked upon the fight against hydrophobia as a battle, and he was absorbed in his determination to win.
          </p>
          <p>
           (C) The sight of injured children particularly moved him to an indescribable extent. He suffered with his patients, and yet he would not deny himself a share in their suffering. His greatest grief was when sheer physical exhaustion made him give up his active work. He retired to the estate at Villeneuve Etang, where he had his kennels for the study of rabies, and there he passed his last summer, as his great biographer, Vallery Radot, has said, “practicing the Gospel virtues.” “He revered the faith of his fathers,” says the same writer, “and wished without ostentation or mystery to receive its aid during his last period.”
          </p>
          <p>
           (D) The attitude of this man to the science he had done so much to perfect can be best summed up in a sentence that he is reputed once to have uttered, concerning the materialism of many of his contemporaries in similar branches of learning to his own: “The more I contemplate the mysteries of Nature, the more my faith becomes like that of a peasant.” But even then, in that pain, he loved to see his former pupils and it was then that he would reiterate his life’s principles, that is ‘never cease to work’. So well had he kept his precept, that he rapidly began to sink from exhaustion.
          </p>
          <p>
           (E) Finally, on September 27,1895, when someone leaned over his bed to offer him a cup of milk, he said sadly, “I cannot”. With a look of perfect resignation and peace, he seemed to have fallen asleep. He never again opened his eyes to the cares and sufferings of the world, which he had done so much to relieve and to conquer. He was within three months of his seventy-third birthday. Thus passed, as simply as a child, the man whom the French people were to vote plebiscite as the greatest man that France had ever produced. Napoleon, who has always been considered the idol of France, was placed fifth. No greater tribute could have been paid to Louis Pasteur, the tanner’s son, the scientist, the man of peace, the patient worker forfor for humanity.
          </p>
          <p>

           Dear Chandni
          </p>
          <p>
           Hope your trip to Hong Kong was full of fun. While you were away on your vacation, our school celebrated 14th November Childrens’ Day as a school fete. All the children along with their class- teachers were very excited. We started planning about one week in advance. Each section of the class had to plan out one food stall and one game stall. This way, from classes Nursery to XII, all had to compulsorily participate in the fete. The active children of our class were given duties at the stalls. Our class-teacher, Juhi ma’am, decided to keep the Lucky draw and Bhelpuri stall. For Bhelpuri, boys had to bring Murmura and green chutney and girls were asked to bring boiled potatoes, tomatoes and onions cut from home and also chaat masala. Juhi ma’am taught us how to make Bhelpuri in our S.U.P. W. period well in advance.
          </p>
          <p>
           And for the lucky draw, we collected ₹ 20/- per member and wrote their nanjes, phone number along with their addresses. We had planned 3 gift hampers containing lots of cold drink cans, wafer biscuits, chocolates, juices, chips, kurkure etc. Each hamper had ₹ 1,000/- worth items. The lucky draw was taken out towards the end of the day. Juhi ma’am made me the cashier to collect money for the lucky draw. I had collected nearly ₹ 10,600/- and our Bhelpuri stall was also a great success. We were selling each plate for ₹ 10/-. This Wily we made a collection of ₹ 5,400/- from Bhelpur I too. Overall, we collected ₹ 16,000/- the highest among all sections. This amount was then kept for the donation to Shishu Bhawan, for a good cause. I wish you were here. We all enjoyed a lot on that busy day, playing a lot of games and eating lots of food. I m issed you a lot. Hoping to see you soon.
          </p>

           <br/>
           Write a short paragraph on ‘If I was Invisible’.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Every once in ,a while, I am surrounded by a thought that what if I was invisible? There are so many things one could do being invisible, it just depends on our creativity and thought process. But if I am ever blessed with the power of invisibility, I will use it positively. I can monitor crime being invisible no one would know I am there and, in this way, I could catch the criminals. I can visit forests without being afraid of the animals. I can help people by monitoring if the services at hospitals, NGOs, etc. are carried out properly. I can visit factories to see if they have appointed child labour.

           Write a description about the most interesting person you have ever met.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           I am a great fan of Akshay Kumar, but my dream of meeting him came true only at my cousin’s wedding reception. It is the time which I will never forget, throughout my life. I still have the picture of my favourite Akki in navy blue lull suit, carrying a huge bouquet of flowers for the bride-groom, wearing a lovely smile on his face accompanied with his wife, Twinkle Khanna coming on stage. What a great day it was for me! From the cramped streets of Chandni Chowk to being a chef in Bangkok and ultimately one of the highest paid actors in Bollywood, Akshay made it to the top without any Godfather, all thanks to his dedication and hard work. He failed at times but never gave up on his way to top.
          </p>
          <p>
           Akshay hardly tasted any success in his take-off years in Bollywood. Akshay believes in family before everything! He doesn’t work on Sundays and spends whole day with his family. His never-say-no attitude earned him the tag of being a versatile actor. Akshay’s movies stand tall and are proof of the fact that he never shied away from taking up roles that were out of his comfort zone. Started from action, then tried romantic roles and finally, making us laugh with his comic timing, Akshay has proven his mettle in all genres of cinema. Humility doesn’t come easy with all that fame and money but Akshay, throughout his time in Bollywood, has kept himself rooted to the ground. He’s a great example of a responsible citizen. Akshay has paid over 20 crores tax to the government this year.

           Read the given excerpts and answer the questions briefly, for ANY TWO excerpts, of the three, given. 4 + 4 = 8
          </p>
          <p>
           (A) “I am the sigh of the sea;
           <br/>
           The laughter of the field The tears of heaven.”
          </p>
          <p>
           (a) What can we infer about rain from the lines above?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The lines imply that rain is a natural occurrence that is closely related to other natural components. Additionally, it implies that both plants and animals benefit and thrive during rain. Last but not the least, “the tears of heaven” implies that rain is a metaphor for feeling and rebirth because it delivers life-giving water to deserted and parched places.
          </p>

           Answer ANY ONE of the following two questions in about 120 words. 6 × 1 = 6
          </p>
          <p>
           (A) Do you think Corporal Turnbull was right in awarding Private Quelch such a harsh punishment? Justify.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Corporal Turnbull was a strict disciplinarian. He did not tolerate any nonsense or any breach of the army code of conduct. He was not a man to be taken for granted. Private Quelch made a serious mistake by taking him lightly. In a bid to make a good impression, he hurt his own career prospects. His desire to show off his knowledge led to his downfall. The punishment he received was justified. Private Quelch had committed almost a sin by interrupting a senior’s lecture and that too, not with a query but with a suggestion of improvement. His efforts to criticise his senior evoked mixed responses of fear and anger.
          </p>
          <p>
           Criticism of a senior in the army was not acceptable and thereby he paid the penalty of being demoted. Quelch had crossed the line and he paid a heavy price. It was an act of gross indiscipline. He had no modesty or humility. He loved to brag about and show off his knowledge. But all the foolish learning did not teach him the common sense needed in most situations. He was used to giving endless sermons to his colleagues. He perhaps felt that he would be appreciated. However, Corporal Turnbull did not share his views and allocated him permanent cookhouse duties.

           (B) Charles Hooper was a man of exemplary courage and perseverance. Nominate him for an award the “Hero Amongst Us”.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Charles Hooper was a man of courage. He met with a serious accident and became paralyzed but then mustered courage to adapt himself to the new situation. He displayed great perseverance during his struggle for survival with the help of his dog Duke. Not a single day went effortless. There was a commendable gradual progress from moving a step on the first day of his effort to walking up to the porch, then to the fence post, to the intersection and finally to the district office. Many a times he lost his balance and fell down exhausted but he had wonderful endurance that kept him going.
          </p>
          <p>
           Hooper was a person full of determination. He set dates as objectives and with the help of Duke, could achieve the same. He had faith in himself and in his ability, No one could dare to say that a paralyzed man couldn’t do the job of a moving salesman taking into account the hard work he did for a successful comeback. Hence, they created a special desk job for him. All along, his dog Duke helped him in his struggle for survival.’ Undoubtedly his courage and power of endurance mate him a strong contender for the award Hero Amongst Us.
