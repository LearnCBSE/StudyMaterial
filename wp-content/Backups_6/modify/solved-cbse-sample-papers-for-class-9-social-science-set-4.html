           The liberals did not believe in universal franchise. In contrast, radicals wanted a nation in which government was based on the majority of a country’s population. Liberals felt men of property mainly should have the vote. They did not want the vote for women. On the other hand, the radical, supported women’s suffragette movements and opposed the privileges of great landowners and wealthy factory owners. They were not against the existence of private property but disliked concentration of property in the hands of a few.
           <br/>
           Conservatives were opposed to radicals and liberals. They accepted that change was necessary but believed that the past had to be respected and change had to be brought about slowly and gradually but steadily.

           <br/>
           (iii) Bhabar
           <br/>

           <br/>
           (ii) Bhangar: The largest part of the Northern Plains is formed of older alluvium. They lie above the floodplains of rivers and present a terrace like feature. This part is called Bhangar.

           How were the Himalayas formed?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Geologists claim that a sea was located where the Himalayas now stand. Internal and external changes of Earth’s crust occurred. It is said that one of the crustal plates, called the Indo- Australian plate, separated from the super-continent named Gondwanaland. It drifted slowly towards the north to collide with the Eurasian plate five million years ago. The northern edge of the Indo-
           <br/>
           Australian plate was pushed beneath the Eurasian plate. After the collision of these two plates, the sedimentary rocks of enclosed ocean folded to form the Himalayas.

           <br/>

           The freedom struggle cherished and nurtured the values of brotherhood, harmony, secularism, social, economic and political equality, giving rights to people, non-discrimination on the basis of caste, religion, gender, region, race, etc.
           <br/>
           The Preamble declares India to be a sovereign, socialist, secular democratic republic.

           Question 16:
           <br/>
           Why is it important to develop irrigation facilities? Explain.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Traditional methods of irrigation are not suitable in modem farming. Farmers cannot afford to rely on the Monsoons alone. Modem irrigation facilities such as diesel-run or electric-run tubewells are able to irrigate fields of crops throughout the year. Farmers can grow multiple crops in a year from the same piece of land if irrigation facilities are modem and well developed. Our farmers are dependent on crops for their livelihood. Without proper irrigation enough foodgrains cannot be grown.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 17:
           <br/>
           How has the environment been adversely affected by the Green Revolution? Explain.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Land being a natural resource, it is necessary to be very careful in its use. Scientific reports indicate that the modem farming methods have overused the natural resource base.
           <br/>
           In many areas, Green Revolution is associated with the loss of soil fertility due to increased use of chemical fertilisers. Also, continuous use of groundwater for tubewell irrigation has reduced the water-table below the ground. Environmental resources like soil fertility and groundwater are built up over many years. Once destroyed it is very difficult to restore them. We must take care of the environment to ensure future development of agriculture.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 18:
           <br/>
           Define the theory of plate tectonics. How has their movement resulted in the formation of Himalayas? Explain.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           According to this theory, the crust of the earth has been formed out of seven major and some minor plates. The movement of the plates results in the building up of stresses within the plates and the continental rocks above, leading to folding, faulting and volcanic activity.
           <br/>
           Geologists claim that a sea was located where the Himalayas now stand. Internal and external changes of Earth’s crust occurred. It is said that one of the crustal plates, called the Indo- Australian plate, separated from the super-continent named Gondwanaland. It drifted slowly towards the north to collide with the Eurasian plate five million years ago. The northern edge of the Indo- Australian plate was pushed beneath the Eurasian plate. After the collision of these two plates, the sedimentary rocks of enclosed ocean folded to form the Himalayas.

           Question 19A:
           <br/>
           What is shifting agriculture? Why was it regarded as harmful by the British? Answer:
           <br/>
           Shifting agriculture or swidden agriculture is a traditional agricultural practice in many parts of Asia, Africa and South America. It has many local names such as ‘lading’ in South-East Asia, ‘milpa’ in Central America, ‘chitemene’ or ‘tavy’ in Africa, ‘chena’ in Sril Lanka, ‘dhya’, ‘penda’, ‘bewar’, ‘nevad’, ‘jhum’, ‘podu’, ‘khandad’ and ‘kumri’ in India.
           <br/>
           In shifting cultivation, parts of a forest are cut and burnt in rotation, seeds are sown in ashes after the first monsoon rains and the crop is harvested by October-November. Such plots are cultivated for a couple of years and then left fallow for 12 to 18 years for the forest to grow back.
           <br/>
           It was regarded by the British as harmful for the forests. They felt that land which was used for cultivation every few years could not grow trees for railway timber. When the forest was burnt, there was the danger of the flames spreading and burning valuable timber.

           Question 19B:
           <br/>
           Why did the British introduce Wasteland Rules? How did they affect the pastoralists? Explain briefly.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Wasteland rules were introduced because to the colonial officials all uncultivated land appeared to be unproductive. It produced neither revenue nor agricultural produce. By these rules uncultivated land was taken over and given to select individuals. These individuals were given concessions and encouraged to settle on these lands. Some of them were made headmen of villages. In most areas, lands taken over were actually grazing tracts, regularly used by pastoralists, and the decline of pastures created trouble for the pastoralists.

           Question 19C:
           <br/>
           Which innovations helped farmers to increase agricultural production in England?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           First new lands were brought under cultivation, landlords sliced up pasture lands, carved up open fields, cut up forests, took over marshes. The farmers started growing turnips and clover as they discovered that these crops improved the soil and made it more fertile. Turnip was also good fodder for the cattle. So, they became part of cropping system.
           <br/>
           They also realised that nitrogen was important for crop growth. Turnip and clover restored the nitrogen and made the soil fertile again.

           Question 20A:
           <br/>
           Why did cultivation expand rapidly under colonial period? Give two points. Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) The British colonial government directly encouraged cultivation.
           <br/>
           (ii) In the early 19th century, the colonial state considered forests to be unproductive.
           <br/>
           (iii) Forests were wilderness which had to be brought under plough.
           <br/>
           (iv) Agriculture could yield foodgrains and revenue, and enhance the income of the state.
           <br/>
           (v) Expansion of cultivation was seen as a sign of progress and prosperity which the colonial state wished to appear to the public.

           Question 20B:
           <br/>
           Who were the Banjaras? Describe their activities.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Banjaras were a well-known group of nomads and graziers who herded cattle like sheep, goats and cows. They lived at outskirts of villages of U.P., Punjab, Rajasthan, M.P., and Maharashtra. They moved from one area to another constantly in search of good pastureland for their cattle. They camped near pastures.
           <br/>
           After setting for a brief period they moved on to new pasture. They moved over long distance selling plough cattle and other goods to villages in exchange for grain and fodder. In course of time, Banjaras became grain merchants selling goods from village to village. They moved in caravans of bullock carts selling grains.

           <br/>
           What were the causes for terrifying duststorms in 1930s in the USA? Give five reasons.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Early 1930s were years of persistent drought. Rains failed year after year and temperatures soared.
           <br/>
           (ii) Winds blew with ferocious speed.
           <br/>
           (iii) Ordinary duststorms became black blizzards because the entire landscape had been ploughed over many times, stripped
           <br/>
           of all grass and plants that held soils together.
           <br/>
           (iv) When wheat cultivation had expanded dramatically in the early 20th century, zealous farmers had recklessly destroyed all vegetation.
           <br/>
           (v) Tractors had overploughed vast tracts of farmland, had turned the soil into tiny dusts, and had broken the sod into dust.

           Question 21:
           <br/>
           Why existence of wildlife is important? Describe in the context of the ecosystem.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Sun is the source of energy for the entire ecosystem. Plants are consumed by herbivorous animals, which are in turn, eaten by carnivorous animals. Lastly, dead animals and plants are consumed by microorganisms. So, all these components are important for balance in the ecosystem. If we withdraw animals from this system then the whole ecosystem is disturbed. So if we disturb the wildlife, it will affect the mankind. In order to preserve and protect the natural habitat of animals and plants, government had passed Wildlife
           <br/>
           Protection Act in 1972. Therefore, the national parks, biosphere reserves and bird sanctuaries have been established to protect the wildlife.

           Question 22:
           <br/>
           What are the powers of the Supreme Court?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Supreme Court controls the judicial administration of the country. Its decisions are binding on all other courts of the country. It can take up any dispute : between citizens of the country; between citizens and government; between two or more state governments; between government at the Union and State level.
           <br/>
           It is the highest court of appeal in civil and criminal cases. It can hear appeals against the decisions of the High Courts. The Supreme Court has the power to interpret the Constitution of the country. It can determine the constitutional validity of any law. This is known as judicial review.

           Question 24:
           <br/>
           How is food security affected during a calamity?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Due to a natural calamity like drought, total production of foodgrains decreases. It creates a shortage of food in the affected areas. Due to shortage of food, the prices go up. At the high prices, some people cannot afford to buy food. If such a calamity happens in a very widespread area or is stretched over a longer time period, it may cause a situation of starvation. A massive starvation might lead to a famine. A famine is characterised by widespread death due to starvation and epidemics caused by forced use of contaminated water or decaying food and loss of body resistance due to weakening from starvation.
