           FW Taylor is considered as the father of scientific management as he opposed rule of thumb and proposed scientific management. He broke up human activity into small parts and found out how it could be done effectively, in less time and increased productivity.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Scientific management
           </strong>
           In words of Taylor, scientific management means knowing exactly what you want men to do and seeing that they do in the best and the cheapest way.

           </strong>
           Decisions should be made on the basis of facts developed by the application of scientific methods.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (ii) Harmony, not discord
           </strong>

            15. Pawan is working as a Production Manager in CFL Ltd engaged in manufacturing of CFL bulbs. There is no class-conflict between the management and workers. The working conditions are very good. The company is earning huge profits. As a policy matter, management is sharing the gains with the workers because they believe that prosperity of the company cannot exist for a long time without the prosperity of the employees.

           ‘Cooperation, not individualism’ is a principle of scientific management which states that there should be complete cooperation between the workers and management in an oganisation instead of individualism and competition. In the absence of constant and willing cooperation between the two sides, maximum prosperity for both the parties cannot be achieved.

           </strong>
           Differential piece wage system is the strongest motivator for a worker to reach standard perforhnance. It is a method of wage payment in which efficient and inefficient workers are paid at different rates. In this method, increase in efficiency is co-related with an increase in the wage rate. That is why, an efficient worker gets more wages whereas, an inefficient worker gets less. Workers are paid on the basis of number of units produced. If a worker produces more than a • certain number of units (standard output), he gets higher wage per piece/units on his total output. If he produces below the standard number, he gets lower rate per piece. Because of different rates of wage for different sets of workers, this is known as differential piece rate plan.

           Standardisation refers to the process of setting standards for every business activity. It can be standardisation of process, raw material, time, product, machinery, methods or working conditions. These standards are the benchmarks which must be adhered during production.
           <br/>
           Simplification aims at eliminating unnecessary varieties, sizes and dimensions of products. It results in saving of cost of labour, machines and tools.

           <strong>
            Mental revolution
           </strong>
           Mental refers to mind and revolution refers to radical change, therefore, mental revolution refers to a change of mind. According to Taylor, a scientific management, in its essence, involves a complete mental revolution on the part of both sides to industry, viz workers and management.
           <br/>
           No scheme of scientific management could be a success, unless and until both these groups fully cooperate with each other through developing and maintaining best friendly relations. This requires a mental revolution on the part of management and workers by giving up an attitude of hostility and enmity towards each other.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Differential piece rate
           </strong>
           Differential piece wage system is the strongest motivator for a worker to reach standard perforhnance. It is a method of wage payment in which efficient and inefficient workers are paid at different rates. In this method, increase in efficiency is co-related with an increase in the wage rate. That is why, an efficient worker gets more wages whereas, an inefficient worker gets less. Workers are paid on the basis of number of units produced. If a worker produces more than a • certain number of units (standard output), he gets higher wage per piece/units on his total output. If he produces below the standard number, he gets lower rate per piece. Because of different rates of wage for different sets of workers, this is known as differential piece rate plan.

            25. Explain any five principles of scientific management.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (All India 2009; Delhi 2009)
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           Five principles of scientific management are as follows:
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (i) Science, not rule of thumb
           </strong>
           Taylor has emphasised that in scientific management, organised knowledge should be applied, which will replace the rule of thumb. Scientific investigations should be used for taking managerial decisions instead of making the decisions on opinions, intuitions, estimates, prejudices, likes and dislikes, etc. Under scientific management, decisions are made on the basis of facts developed by the application of scientific methods.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (ii) Harmony, not discord
           </strong>
           (Conflict) There should be harmony between the management and the workers. This requires change of mental attitudes of the workers and the management towards each other. Taylor called it mental revolution. Management should share gains of the company with workers.
           <br/>
           They should create suitable working conditions and resolve all problems scientifically. Mental revolution on the part of workers requires that they should be disciplined, loyal and sincere in fulfilling the tasks assigned to them. Instead of fighting for dividing surplus or profit, the management and workers should cooperate to increase it.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (iii) Cooperation, not individualism
           </strong>
           There should be cooperation between workers and management. It is only through cooperation with workmen, the managers can ensure that work is carried out according to plans. Cooperation is based on mutual faith so managers should develop understanding with workers to secure the cooperation.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (iv) Development of each and every person to his/her greatest efficiency and prosperity
           </strong>
           Industrial efficiency depends upon the efficiency of workers and worker’s efficiency depends upon proper training and their proper selection. Taylor suggested that due care should be taken while selecting the employees and after selecting, they must be given job according to their physical, mental and intellectual capabilities.
           <br/>
           Employees must sent for training from time to time to update their knowledge. This will ensure greatest efficiency and prosperity for both workers and management.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (v) Maximum output in place of restricted output
           </strong>
           The aim of both management and the workers should be to maximise output. This should be done by both parties in their own/self interest. For management, increased production means more profits and lower cost of production. For workers, increased output may offer attractive wages.
           <br/>
           In this way, self interest that implies both management and the workers to achieve maximum output. Maximum output will also be in the interest of the society.

           The ultimate aim of scientific management is to maximise production at the minimum cost. Scientific management is introduced through the techniques of work study, standardisation, simplification, functional foremanship, etc.
           <br/>
           Following are the five techniques of scientific management:
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (i) Time study
           </strong>
           It refers to determine the standard time required to complete a particular activity. The standard time is determined on the basis of average time taken to complete the work. This study is conducted with the help of a stop watch. The main objective of this study is to get the estimated figure of labour cost to determine the number of required workers and to decide the suitable incentive plan.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (ii) Motion study
           </strong>
           This is the analysis of physical movements in doing a work. Every work involves various forms of human movements such as lifting, holding, turning, etc. Under motion study, the movement will be analysed to find out easier ways of doing the work and eliminate useless motions.
           <br/>
           Following steps are involved in motion study:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Selection of efficient workers.

             (iii) Method study
            </strong>
            It refers to identifying the most suitable way to do a particular activity. To conduct this study, process chart and operation restarch techniques are used.

            <strong>
             (iv) Fatigue study
            </strong>
            Fatigue in work is natural. When the worker is given continuous work, he will get tired and loose speed and efficiency. He needs rest after working for a few hours. Scientific management studies the nature of work to determine the standard time for finishing the job and to find out when the workers need rest. The nature, time and period of rest are pre-determined. Necessary changes should also be made in the working methods and conditions to reduce fatigue.
            <br/>
