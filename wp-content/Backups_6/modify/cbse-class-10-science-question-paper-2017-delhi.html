           <br/>
           Sustainable management means the judicious use of the natural resources by the present generations so that these resources are also available for the future generations. In the recycling of materials some energy is used and also harmful gases are produced which pollute the environment, while reuse of materials does not consume energy.

           Question 7.
           <br/>
           Describe the structure and functioning of nephron.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Structure of nephron. Nephron is the basic filtration unit in the kidney. It consists of a tubule which is connected with a collecting duct at one end and a cup shaped structure at the Other end, called Bowman’s capsule. Every Bowman’s capsule contains a cluster of capillaries, called glomerulus within the cup-shaped structure. The blood enters into glomerulus through afferent arteriole of renal artery and leaves it through efferent arteriole.
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Class 10 Science Question Paper 2017 (Delhi) with Solutions Img 2" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-163644" height="318" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CBSE-Class-10-Science-Question-Paper-2017-Delhi-with-Solutions-Img-2.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CBSE-Class-10-Science-Question-Paper-2017-Delhi-with-Solutions-Img-2.png 361w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CBSE-Class-10-Science-Question-Paper-2017-Delhi-with-Solutions-Img-2-300x264.png 300w" width="361"/>
           <br/>
           Basic functions of Nephrons:
           <br/>
           (i) Filteration. Filteration of the blood takes place in Bowman’s capsule in the capillaries of the glomerulus. Then this filterate passes into the tubular part of the nephron. The filterate contains glucose, amino acids, urea and uric acid and a large amount of water.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Reabsorption. The filterate flows along the tubule and useful substances such as glucose, amino acids, salts and some water are re-absorbed into the blood by the capillaries surrounding the nephron tubule.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Urine. The filterate which remains after the re-absorption is called the urine, which is collected from nephron by the collecting duct to carry it to the urinary bladder and then to the urethra.

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           What is an electromagnet? Name two factors on which the strength of the electromagnet depends?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When soft iron core is inserted into the solenoid coil and current is passed through such an arrangement, then it is known as electromagnet.
           <br/>
           Strength of the electromagnet depends on the quantity of current flowing through the solenoid. More the value of current, more is the strength of the electromagnet and vice- versa. It also depends on the number of turns in the solenoid. More the number of turns, more is the strength of the electromagnet and vice-versa.

           Question 13.
           <br/>
           State the basic requirement for sexual reproduction? Write the importance of such reproduction in nature.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The basic requirement for sexual reproduction is sexual interaction of male and female parents to cause fusion of male gamete with female gamete to form zygote. Then from the zygote develops the new child. Importance of such reproduction.
           <br/>
           Such sexual reproduction leads to more variation in the offsprings for their successful living in the changing environmental conditions. More variations also lead to evolution of new species after some generations. It leads to diversity in the population which helps in natural selection.

           Question 14.
           <br/>
           “The father is responsible for the sex of the child, not the mother.” Justify the statement.
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            A male has one X-chromosome and one Y-chromosome. Thus half the male gametes have X-chromosomes and the other half have Y-chromosomes,
           </li>
           <li>
            A female has two X-chromosomes. Thus all female gametes have only X- chromosomes.
           </li>
           <li>
            If a sperm carrying Y-chromosome fertilises an ovum carrying X-chromosome, then the child born will be a boy.
           </li>
           <li>
            If a sperm carrying X-chromosome fertilises an ovum carrying X-chromosome, then the child born will be a girl.

           <br/>
           Describe double circulation in human beings.
           <br/>
           (a) Why is it necessary?
           <br/>
           (b) How are arteries different from veins?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Double circulation of blood means, that the blood enters twice in the heart during its once circulation in other parts of the body. First time oxygenated blood from lungs enters the left atrium and second time de-oxygenated blood enters the right atrium through two main vena cava. Double circulation of blood is necessary to separate the oxygenated blood from the de-oxygenated blood to provide more energy for effecient working of body organs.

           Question 18.
           <br/>
           (a) List the products produced on combustion of fossil fuels.
           <br/>
           (b) What are their adverse effects on the environment?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) When fossil fuels are burnt, the products of combustion are — carbon dioxide, water, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. If combustion takes place in an insufficient supply of air then carbon monoxide is produced. All these products are harmful and create some adverse effects on the environment.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Adverse effects of products produced on combustion of fossil fuels:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Sulphur dioxide dissolves in rainwater making it acidic. The acid rain thus produced damages trees, plants, buildings and metal structures.
           </li>
           <li>
            Nitrogen oxide also causes acid rain.
           </li>
           <li>
            Carbon monoxide is a green house gas which traps Sun’s heat energy falling on the earth. The increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes increased green house effects leading to global warming.
           </li>
          </ul>

           Question 19.
           <br/>
           Soaps and detergents are both types of salts. State the difference between the two. Write the mechanism of cleansing action of soaps. Why do soaps not form lather (foam) with hard water? Mention any two problems that arise due to the use of detergents instead of soaps.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           • Soaps are the sodium salts or potassium salts of long chain carboxylic acids, while the detergents are the ammonium or sulphonate salts of long chain carboxylic acids.
           <br/>

           <br/>
           • Mechanism of cleansing action of soaps. Soaps
           <br/>
           molecules in which the two ends have differing properties, one is hydrophilic, that is, it dissolves in water, while the other end is hydrophobic, that is, it dissolves in hydrocarbons. When soap is at the surface of water, the hydrophobic ‘tail’ of soap will not be soluble in water and the soap will align along the surface of water with the ionic end in water and the hydrocarbon ‘tail’ protruding out of water.
          </p>
          <p>
           Inside water, these molecules have a unique orientation that keeps the hydrocarbon portion out of the water. This is achieved by forming clusters of molecules in which the hydrophobic tails are in the interior of the cluster and the ionic ends are on the surface of the cluster. This formation is called a micelle.
          </p>
          <p>
           Soap in the form of a micelle is able to clean, since the oily dirt will be collected in the centre of the micelle. The micelles stay in solution as a colloid and will not come together to precipitate because of ion-ion repulsion. Thus, the dirt suspended in the micelles is also easily rinsed away.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            With hard water soap molecules form insoluble salts with Ca

            Two problems of using detergents:
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (i) Detergents are non-biodegradable and thus these cause pollution of water bodies,
           <br/>
           (ii) Detergents are strong cleansing agents but these cause damage to the skins of the person using them.

           Question 20.
           <br/>
           (a) Name the organ that produces sperms as well as secretes a hormone in human males. Name the hormone it secretes and write its functions.
           <br/>
           (b) Name the parts of the human female reproductive system where fertilization occurs.
           <br/>
           (c) Explain how the developing embryo gets nourishment inside the mother’s body.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) This organ is testes. The hormone secreted by testis is testosterone. This hormone controls the changes which occur in human males during puberty. It leads to formation of sperms and development of secondary sexual characters.
           <br/>
           (b) This part is Fallopian tube.
           <br/>
           (c) Developing embryo gets the nourishment inside the mother’s body from Placenta which is developed on the wall of the uterus of the mother. It provides a large surface area for glucose and oxygen to pass from the mother’s blood to the developing embryo.

           <br/>
           (c) Draw a labelled ray diagram to show the formation of a rainbow.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) These two rays are:
           <br/>
           (i) Ray of light parallel to principal axis, passes through point F of concave mirror after its reflection.
           <br/>
           (ii) Ray of light passing through point C of the mirror, is reflected back on the same path after reflection from the mirror.

           (b) m = -3, u = -20 cm, v = ?
           <br/>
           m = \(\frac{-v}{u}\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ -3 = \(\frac{-v}{-20}\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ v = -60 cm
           <br/>
           Distance between the screen and the object distance = [-60 – (-20)] = -40 cm
           <br/>
           So, the screen is at a distance of 40 cm from the object.

           In dicot plants stomata are found in lower surface only, hence peel is taken from the lower surface. As stomata are present on both the surfaces of leaf in monocot plants so the peel can be taken from either surface.
