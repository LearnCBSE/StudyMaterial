           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Why was the ‘holy man’ who gave Santosh’s mother his blessings surprised?
           <strong>
            (1)
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The ‘holy man’ who gave Santosh’s mother his blessings was surprised because her grandmother sought blessings for a daughter. In this society most of the people ask the seers to bless for a son.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Give an example to show that even as a young girl Santosh was not ready to accept anything unreasonable.

            II. Answer each of these questions in a short paragraph (about 30 words).
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           How did Santosh begin to climb mountains?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           She wished to climb mountains when she watched villagers from her room, going up the hill and suddenly vanishing after a while. One day, she decided to check it out herself. She found nobody except a few mountaineers. Later she saved money and enrolled in a course at Uttarkashi’s Nehru Institute of Mountaineering. Then she began climb mountains every year.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           What incidents during the Everest expedition show Santosh’s concern for her team-mates?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Santosh Yadav provided special care to a climber who lay dying at the south pole in 1992 Everest Mission. She saved Mohan Singh, who would have lost his life had she not shared her oxygen with him.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           What shows her concern for the environment?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Santosh was really concerned for the environment. She collected and brought down 500 kilograms of garbage from the Himalayas.
          </p>

           Question 4.
           <br/>
           How does she describe her feelings at the summit of the Everest?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           She said that it took some time for the enormity of the moment to sink in. She was delighted at this moment and proudly unfurled the Indian tricolour.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Santosh Yadav got into the record books both times she scaled Mt. Everest. What were the reasons for this?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           She is the youngest woman who scaled the Everest. She is the only woman who climbed the Everest twice.

            The Raincoat
           </strong>
           <br/>
           After four years of drought in a small town in the Northeast, the Vicar gathered everyone together for a pilgrimage to the mountain, where they would pray together and ask for the rain to return.
          </p>
          <p>
           The priest noticed a boy in the group wearing a raincoat.
          </p>
          <p>
           “Have you gone mad ?” he asked. “It hasn’t rained in this region for five years, the heat will kill you climbing the mountain.”
          </p>
          <p>
           “I have a cold, father. If we are going to ask God for rain, can you imagine the way back from the mountain ? It’s going to be such a downpour that I need to be prepared.”
          </p>
          <p>
           At that moment a great crash was heard in the sky and the first drops began to fall. A boy’s faith was enough to bring about a miracle that not even those most prepared truly believed in.

           I am glad to see all the participants at this platform. Your life solely depends on the sincere efforts you are ready to make. Your indomitable faith in your potential, strong determination and hard work can help you in bringing laurels to your family, nation and yourself. One must not lose confidence while trying to achieve a challenging task. Those who devote themselves completely to their goals and are self-confident attain considerable success within a short span of time. Their achievements boost their morale and become a source of fascination to others. My advice to you is to maintain the spirit of sportsmanship and do miracles in whatever field you are.
