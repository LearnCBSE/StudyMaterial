           Reading Comprehension Through Unseen Passages
           <br/>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the following text. (10)
           <br/>
           1. Parents are changing the plots of classic fairy tales when reading them aloud because of violence and political incorrectness. Traditional fables such as ‘Little Red Riding Hood’, ‘The Ginger Bread Man’ and ‘The Three Little Pigs’ were deemed the worst offenders, with parents linking some of their endings to horror films.
          </p>
          <p>
           2. The poll which was commissioned by Music Magpie included 2000 parents and revealed that one in four took creative liberties when sharing fairytales with their children to suit their beliefs and ideologies. Meanwhile, another 16% confessed to banning them altogether.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           3. While these classic tales might seem playful and innocent on the surface, a closer look at the plot, lines and characters reveals some problematic traits. For example, in ‘Little Red Riding Hood’, ‘The child is eaten alive by a wolf, only to be saved by a hunter who. cuts her out of the animal’s stomach with an axe’. ‘The Three Little Pigs’ also reaches a rather gory conclusion with the pigs murdering a wolf and eating it. Lest we forget ‘The Ginger Bread Man’, whose protagonist is also eaten by a fox. It is an ending that’s hard for parents to swallow, with one of them labelling it as ‘too cruel’ in the survey.
          </p>
          <p>
           4. However, a deeper analysis of some of the nation’s most popular tales unveiled even further issues with regard to political correctness. One in four parents found it inappropriate that ‘Cindrella has to do all of the cleanings in her home while another 25% argued that ‘sleeping beauty’ poses a consent issue, given that prince charming kisses the princess while she is asleep. Meanwhile, 27% believe that ‘Pinocchio’ encourages children to tell lies while one in four claims that ‘The Ugly Duckling’ in which an abused duckling is only accepted by society after he has grown into a swan, advocates body shaming.
          </p>
          <p>
           5. Some of these stories have been around for generations. ‘But times have changed and there are elements to these classics which for some don’t really fit into society as they once did. We all agree that stories play a vital role in the growth and development of children. The books they read and the characters they get to know can become like friends. Reading stories also helps children with their confidence levels, coping with emotions, and language learning.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           6. So stories are a great way to learn in a natural way as there is no teaching involved in it. The learners learn from simply reading the story. The choice of stories must be judicious.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Read the following text. [10]
           <br/>
           (1) Reduction in green areas has caused various environmental problems. People squeezed between concrete structures are looking for various ways to meet their longing for green. One of the ways to do so is vertical gardens and green walls. Vertical gardening is a unique method of gardening where plants are grown in a vertical position or upward, rather than in the traditional method of planting them on the ground.
          </p>
          <p>
           (2) The purpose of vertical gardens and green walls, which arises from the studies of different disciplines (landscape architects, architects, engineers, etc.), is to close the cold image of concrete and increase its visual value. In these systems, nature and structures are integrated, and thus, urban areas and the desired environment have become intertwined.
          </p>
          <p>
           (3) Vertical garden case studies often show that, though functionality should be in the foreground, when vertical gardens are planned, they are generally made as aesthetic elements in the city’s underpasses and city squares, and decorative elements in residences, without seeking functionality.
          </p>
          <p>
           (4) Experts support that the visual quality and evaluation of landscape architecture is determined based on the satisfaction of the users. Hence, a survey questionnaire was prepared for residents of varied age groups from a metropolitan city. The given Table 1, displays these responses:
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 10 English Set 1 with Solutions 1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-101999" height="575" loading="lazy" src="https://www.cbsetuts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-English-Set-1-with-Solutions-1.png" width="756"/>
          </p>
          <p>
           (5) The study acknowledged that vertical gardening has the potential to transform urban spaces into green, sustainable areas, and further research should explore the impact of vertical gardening on the environment and human well-being. (Adapted for academic usage-2019 case study-Investigating the vertical garden applications in Turkey) (225, words approx.)
           <br/>
           Answer the following questions, based on the passage above.
           <br/>
           (i) Complete the following analogy appropriately, based on your understanding of paragraphs 1 &amp; 2. [1]
           <br/>
           We can say that the situation of people living in concrete structures is comparable with a fish living in a fishbowl, and the need for vertical gardens to the need for decorations in the fishbowl because …………………
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           … fish needs decorations such as plants or rocks, to simulate a natural environment and improve their quality of life, people living in urban areas need green spaces such as vertical gardens to improve their physical and mental well-being.
          </p>
          <p>
           The analogy highlights the importance of providing a natural and healthy environment for living beings, regardless of their habitat, and emphasizes the need to explore creative solutions to meet this need.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Fill the blanks with the appropriate option from those given in brackets, based on your understanding of paragraph 2. [1]
           <br/>
           The statement that, urban spaces have become more closely connected with the desired natural surroundings through the incorporation of nature and structures in vertical gardens and green walls, is a ………………… (fact/opinion) because it is a …………………… (subjective judgment/ objective detail).
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Opinion; subjective judgment
           <br/>
           This statement expresses a viewpoint or belief about the benefits of incorporating nature and structures through vertical gardens and green walls in urban spaces. While there may be evidence to support this opinion, such as research on the positive effects of greenery on well-being or the visual appeal of vertical gardens, it is still ultimately a subjective judgment rather than an objective fact that can be proven or disproven.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Justify the following, in about 40 words.
           <br/>
           While the survey results suggest that vertical gardens may be effective in improving the quality of life in urban areas, further research and evaluation may he necessary to fully understand their effectiveness and potential drawbacks. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           True, because the majority of participants strongly agreed or agreed that vertical gardens can improve the quality of life, increase air qualit,y and have a relaxing and calming effect. However, the survey does not provide information on the long-term effectiveness of vertical gardens or their potential impact on other aspects of urban life, such as traffic or community engagement.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) Based on the survey results, which two concerns should a city government, looking to install vertical gardens, address? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A city government looking to install vertical gardens should consider addressing these concerns:
           <br/>
           cost of installation and maintenance should be reasonable.
           <br/>
           areas of installation should be where driver distraction is less of an issue.
           <br/>
           Both need to be mentioned as the survey reflects these.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) In Table 1, statement 3, “Vertical gardens increase air quality – indoors and outdoors,” received the most neutral responses from participants, with 51 respondents indicating a neutral stance. State any one inference that can be drawn from this. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Possible inferences: (anyone)
           <br/>
           Participants may not be fully informed or aware of the effects of vertical gardens on air quality, which could contribute to the neutral response.
           <br/>
           This suggests a need for more education and awareness campaigns around the benefits of vertical gardens.
           <br/>
           The perceived effect of vertical gardens on air quality may vary based on the specific location or environment in which they are installed.
           <br/>
           This could explain the higher number of neutral responses, as participants may not have enough information to judge the statement in a generalized manner.
           <br/>
           It is possible that participants did not have a strong opinion or preference regarding the effect of vertical gardens on air quality, which resulted in a neutral response.
           <br/>

           Rajajipura, JaipurSubject: Suggestion Regarding the Need to Form Ecology Clubs
           <br/>
           Madam
           <br/>
           This letter is written to express my concern about the environmental degradation in our city and to suggest a solution that I believe, could help in preserving and conserving nature. I believe that forming Ecology clubs and appointing Eco-minders in our city can aid in this endeavour.
          </p>
          <p>
           Ecology clubs can be run by resident volunteers who may undertake activities such as making bird-houses, planting native trees, water harvesting, and creating compost piles to nurture and protect the local ecosystem. By involving the residents in these activities, we can raise awareness about the importance of preserving nature and instill a sense of responsibility towards it.
          </p>
          <p>
           Some of the implications of forming Ecology clubs are reduction of pollution levels, increase in biodiversity, and promotion of sustainable practices. This initiative will enhance the quality of life of the residents by providing them with a green and healthy environment.
          </p>
          <p>
           Madam, you are requested to kindly consider this suggestion to ensure better preservation and conservation of nature.

           <br/>
           Dear Sir,
           <br/>
           As someone who believes that languages can help bridge regional divides and promote unity, I am writing to suggest the introduction of an online regional language learning programme in our city to help the recently relocated residents (of all ages) establish a healthy rapport with the local residents and promote mutual understanding.
          </p>
          <p>
           This online programme, organised and run by student councils and language clubs, can help these residents pick up the local language organically. This initiative may be conducted only on weekends for three months, making it feasible for participants to attend without hindering their work or studies.
          </p>
          <p>
           Activities such as language exchange programmes, cultural events, and group discussions on the virtual platform can be undertaken to make this programme more engaging. I hope that publishing this letter in the columns of your Daily shall urge the community to support this programme for its potential, to bring people together, promote language proficiency. and foster a sense of brotherhood.

          <p>
           Recent studies have shown a rapid conversion of impaired glucose tolerance to diabetes in the southern states of India, where the prevalence of diabetes among adults has reached approximately 20% in urban populations and approximately 10% in rural populations. Because of the considerable disparity in the availability and affordability of diabetes care, as well as low awareness of the disease, the glycemic outcome of treated patients is far from ideal.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A.
           <br/>
           Poverty : A Perennial Problem in India
           <br/>
           Poverty in India has manifested itself in many ways. It has become one of the major ever-continuous problems that our country faces today. Be it landless labourers, street cobblers, rag pickers, vendors or beggars, all of them fall under the category of ‘poor’. Even though there has been a decrease in the population of people living below the poverty line, the problem still persists. The given bar graph compares the percentage of the population living below the poverty line across different states of India in the years, 1973-74 and 1999-2000.
          </p>
          <p>
           The decrease in the poor population is very evident in all the states. It comes as an encouraging note that in two of the states the decline has been drastic. Gujarat has seen a decrease of 23% of the poor population from 48% to 15% in the space of about 26 years. A similar decrease of 36% is seen in West Bengal from 63 % to 27% within the same time gap. At the same time, many states including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha have shown a slow decline. They account for 70% of the poor stratum of the society in 1999-2000. Thus, a lot needs to be done to completely eradicate this social evil from the country.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           B.
           <br/>
           The Indian Diabetic Burden
           <br/>
           India, a country experiencing rapid socio-economic progress and urbanisation, carries a considerable share of the global diabetes burden. Studies in different parts of India have demonstrated an escalating prevalence of diabetes not only in urban populations but also in rural populations as a result of the urbanisation of lifestyle parameters. The prevalence of prediabetes is also high. Recent studies have shown rapid conversion of impaired glucose tolerance to diabetes in the Southern states of India where the Prevalence of diabetes among adults has reached approximately 20% in urban populations and approximately 10% in rural populations.
          </p>
          <p>
           Due to the considerable disparity in the availability and affordability of diabetes care, as well as awareness of the disease, the glycemic outcome in treated patients is far from ideal. Lower age at onset and a lack of good glycemic control are likely to increase the occurrence of vascular complications. The economic burden of treating diabetes and its complications is considerable. Lifestyle modification is an effective tool for the primary prevention of diabetes in India. The primary prevention of diabetes is urgently needed in India to curb the rising burden of diabetes.

           Question 6.
           <br/>
           Read the given extracts and answer the questions for ANY ONE of the two, given. [5]
           <br/>
           A. The question he tried to answer was simple: What is the purpose of the twelve tiny gold spots on a monarch pupa?
           <br/>
           “Everyone assumed the spots were just ornamental,” E Bright said.
           <br/>
           “But Dr Urquhart didn’t believe it.”
          </p>
          <p>
           To find the answer, Ebright and another excellent science student first had to build a device that showed that the spots were producing a hormone necessary for the butterfly’s full development. This project won Ebrigh first place in the county fair and entry into the International Science and Engineering Fair. There he won third place for zoology. He also got a chance to work during the summer at the entomology laboratory of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. (The Making of a Scientist)
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) State any one inference about Dr Urquhart from the given context: [1]
           <br/>
           Everyone assumed the spots were just ornamental,” Ebright said.
           <br/>
           “But Dr Uriiuhart didn’t believe it.”
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           We can infer from the context given above that Dr Urquhart was a scientist who questioned assumptions and was willing to investigate alternative explanations for phenomena. He was a curious scientist and was not content to simply accept conventional wisdom.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) State TRUE or FALSE. [1]
           <br/>
           None of the terms (a) -(d) below, can be applied to the question – What is the purpose of the twelve tiny gold spots on a monarch pupa?
           <br/>
           (a) A hypothesis – a proposed explanation for a phenomenon
           <br/>
           (b) An assumption – something that is taken for granted or assumed to be true without proof
           <br/>
           (c) A premise – a proposition that forms the basis of an argument
           <br/>
           (d) A theory – a well-substantiated explanation for a natural phenomenon
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           TRUE
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Ebright’s approach towards finding the purpose of the gold spots on a monarch pupa was highly effective. Elaborate in about 40 words, concerning the extract. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Ebright’s approach was highly effective in finding the purpose of the gold spots on a monarch pupa. By building a device that showed that the spots were producing a hormone necessary for the butterfly’s full development, he was able to provide evidence that contradicted the prevailing assumption that the spots were purely ornamental. This earned him recognition in science fairs and provided him with opportunities to work at research laboratories.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) Which phrase would correctly substitute ‘a chance’, in the given sentence from the extract. [1]
           <br/>

           B. LOMOV: It’s cold… I’m trembling all over, just as if I’d got an examination before me. The great thing is, I must have my mind made up. If I give myself time to think, to hesitate, to talk a lot, to look for an ideal, or for real love, then I’ll never get married. Brr,..It’s cold! Natalya Stepanovna is an excellent housekeeper, not bad-looking, well educated. What more do I want? But I’m getting a noise in my ears from excitement. (Drinks) And it’s impossible for me not to marry. In the first place, I’m already 35- a critical age. so to speak. In the second place, I ought to lead a quiet and regular life. I suffer from palpitations1 I’m excitable and always getting awfully upset; at this very moment my lips are trembling, and there’s a twitch in my right eyebrow. (The Proposal)
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) Which of the following is NOT a reason why Lomov thinks he must marry? [1]

           <br/>
           D. He is in love with Natalya.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Why is it fair to say that Lomov’s tone, when he says “What more do ¡ want?”, is uncertain and questioning? Answer in about 40 words. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Lomov’s tone when he says “What more do I want?” is uncertain and questioning because he is trying to convince himself that Natalya Stepanovna is a suitable match for him, but at the same time, he seems to be struggling with doubts and fears. His tone suggests that he is trying to reassure himself that he has made the right decision, but he is not entirely convinced.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Read the following descriptions (a)-(c) and identify which one correctly corresponds to the extract. [1]

           <br/>
           B. A soliloquy is a speech given by a character alone on stage, which reveals their innermost thoughts and feelings to the audience.
           <br/>
           C. An aside is a brief comment or remark made by a character directly to the audience, which is not intended to be heard by other characters on stage.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           B. A soliloquy is a speech given by a character alone on stage, which reveals their innermost thoughts and feelings to the audience.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) If an actor were to enact this extract, what would he be required to focus on, while modulating his voice? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The actor would be required to convey Lomov’s nervousness and excitement through his voice modulation.

           Question 8.
           <br/>
           Answer ANY FOUR of the following five questions, in about 40-50 words. [4 x 3 = 12]
           <br/>
           Justify the opinion that the traditional baker and his bread play a significant role in the cultural and social fabric of Goan society. (Glimpses of India-I) [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The traditional baker and his bread indeed play a significant role in the cultural and social fabric of Goan society. The Portuguese introduced their famous loaves of bread to Goa, they left but the bread-makers remained, and their age-old, time-tested furnaces still exist. The baker’s bread was not just a staple food item, but it was an essential part of Goan cuisine and culture. It also served as a symbol of social and economic status.
          </p>
          <p>
           The traditional baker and his bread played a vital role in local commerce, that is, the baker would sell his bread by going from house to house that played a critical role in local distribution and trade. The continued existence of these bakers and their furnaces represents a living connection to Goa’s cultural and culinary heritage that continues to be cherished and celebrated by the local community.

           (ii) How does Leslie Norris use vivid imagery and metaphorical language in A Tiger in the Zoo, to effectively depict the confinement and oppression, experienced by the captive tiger. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Leslie Norris expresses imagery through the use of the words “vivid stripes” and “pads of velvet quiet” that create a powerful image of the tiger’s physical beauty and grace restricted within the confines of the cage. Also, the contrast between the tiger’s natural habitat and its captivity is highlighted through the description of its expected behaviour in the wild such as “sliding through long grass” and “snarling around houses” and its actual behaviour within the cage.
          </p>
          <p>
           The metaphorical language used in “quiet rage” and “ignoring visitors” conveys the tiger’s frustration and anger at being confined. The last two lines, “He hears the last voice at night, the patrolling cars, and stares with his brilliant eyes at the brilliant stars,” depicts the tiger’s longing for freedom and its natural habitat.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Explain how the description of the devastation caused by the hailstorm reflects the sadness within Lencho, in A Letter to Good? [3]
           <br/>
           Refer to the given lines, from the text – Not a leaf remained on the trees. The corn was totally destroyed. The flowers were gone from the plants. Lencho’s soul was filled with sadness.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The fact that “not a leaf remained on the trees” and “the flowers were gone from the plants” suggests a sense of emptiness and loss, which mirrors Lencho’s feelings of despair and disappointment. The destruction of the corn, which was the source of his livelihood, is particularly devastating for him. The emptiness and desolation of the landscape thus serve as a powerful metaphor for Lencho’s inner state of mind, emphasizing the magnitude of his disappointment and hopelessness.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) Kitty was a trusted friend to Anne. Elaborate. (From the Diary of Anne Frank) [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Annie’s longing of a trustworthy friend was found in the form of a diary “Kitty”. The diary fulfilled her desire of expressing things without the fear of being judged. She stopped feeling lonely and depressed. Kitty was a patient listener and that turned to be really therapeutic for her. When Annie processed her feelings in the diary, it gave her a sense of comfort and companionship, providing her with an outlet to process her emotions and cope with her challenges. In the existing circumstances, the diary proved to be an excellent choice of a companion who would always stay with her forever.

           (v) How does Ogden Nash’s The Tale of Custard the Dragon, challenge the notion that individuals should conform to societal expectations? [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           “The Tale of Custard the Dragon’ defies conformity by portraying a supposedly timid dragon, Custard, who unexpectedly threatens the pirate and kills him. Through this, Nash challenges societal expectations, urging readers appearances. The poem underscores individuality and the folly of underestimating based on norms and expectations.

           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Answer ANY TWO of the following three questions, in about 40 – 50 words. (2 × 3 = 6)
           <br/>
           (i) Do you think it is a significant detail in the story that Anil is a struggling writer?
           <br/>
           Does this explain his behaviour in any way? (The Thief’s Story) (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Yes, it is a significant detail that Anil is a struggling writer. He had no regular source of income. Consequently, he used to spend according to his pocket, when he had money he would celebrate and when he didn’t have money, he borrowed it. This fact somewhere explains the kindness and sympathy with which he treats Hari. His condition is to some extent similar to Hari’s. Just like Hari, he also struggles to get proper meals. He understands Hari’s condition and thus, helps Hari.

           (ii) “Griffin was rather a lawless person.” Comment. (Footprints Without Feet) (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Griffin was a brilliant scientist but he was a lawless person. After becoming invisible because of his experiment, he not only set his landlord’s house on fire but also robbed a theatrical shop in London, as well as the clergyman in Iping . He also hit the villagers including Mrs Hall, her husband, Constable Jaffers, etc. With his criminal bent of mind, he used his invisibility for his own benefit.

           (iii) What are the subtle ways in which the lady manages to deceive Horace Danby into thinking she is the lady of the house? Why doesn’t Horace suspect that something is wrong? (A Question of Trust) (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The lady’s confident walk, her familiarity with the dog Sherry, her act of touching up her make-up and the ease with which she picks a cigarette from the right place are enough to deceive Horace into thinking that she was the lady of the house. Horace does not suspect anything as he was too frightened to think properly.

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Answer ANY ONE of the following two questions, in about 100-120 words. [1 x 6 = 6]
           <br/>
           (i) You have been asked to present an evaluation of the approaches of the mothers of both, the baby seagull and Amanda, towards helping their children. Write this presentation draft including your insights, in about 120 words, comparing the approaches of both parents. [6]
           <br/>
           You may begin this way:
           <br/>
           One acknowledges that both parents, Atnanda’s mother, and the baby seagull’s mother both…. however, …
           <br/>
           (Reference -Amanda &amp; His First Flight)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The baby seagull’s mother was a parent who wanted to better her child’s Life by pushing him out of his comfort zone and encouraging him to learn new skills. She believed that her son is capable of flying, even though he was afraid, and tried to motivate him. However, the mother’s approach also had some drawbacks. By constantly pushing the baby seagull to fly, she was putting him in danger and risking his physical well-being.
          </p>
          <p>
           On the other hand, Amanda’s mother is depicted as a strict and critical figure who is presented as always correcting Amanda’s behaviour, from her posture and habits to her academic performance and personal hygiene. While her intentions may be good, her methods are shown to be ineffective, and in some cases, harmful.
          </p>
          <p>
           By constantly nit-picking Amanda’s behaviour, her mother creates an atmosphere of tension and anxiety, which only serves to make Amanda feel worse about herself. This also causes Amanda to feel like she can never measure up, leading her to seek solace in imaginary worlds and fantasies.
          </p>
          <p>
           Even though both mothers have good intentions and want to better their children’s lives, their methods, in part, may be misguided or ineffective. The seagull’s mother could benefit from being more sensitive to her child’s emotions, while Amanda’s mother could benefit from focusing on her daughter’s strengths and building her self-esteem. Ultimately, the best approach of both parents would be the one that would balance positive reinforcement with sensitivity to the child’s needs and limitations.

           OR
           <br/>
           (ii) You have been chosen to address a student gathering from the neighborhood schools, to speak on the resilience of human spirit required to transcend discrimination. Prepare the speech draft in not more than 120 words, concerning the commonality of themes in Nelson Mandela: Long Walk for Freedom and The Trees by Adrienne Rich.
          </p>
          <p>
           You may begin this way:
           <br/>
           Good morning, everyone. Today, 1d like to discuss two pieces of literature that offer a powerful insight into the resilience of the human spirit required to transcend discrimination.
           <br/>
           You may end this way.
           <br/>
           To conclude, I’d like to say that …
           <br/>
           Thank you
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Good morning everyone.
           <br/>
           Today, I’d like to discuss two pieces of literature that offer a powerful insight into the resilience of the human spirit required to transcend discrimination. Both Mandela’s excerpt and Rich’s poem address the issue of discrimination. Mandela mentioned his
           <br/>
           own experiences of discrimination and oppression which made him determined to fight against the divides created by race, gender, and class. In Rich’s poem, there is a mention of discrimination faced by trees and the metaphorical perspective for it is the growth of women who were once suppressed and marginalised by society, now breaking free from the chains and striving for a better future. Mandela emphasises that true freedom is breaking physical as well as mental chains.
          </p>
          <p>
           Rich’s poems speaks of the efforts required to protect trees and nature highlighting the importance of activism and advocacy. Mandela’s perseverance and unwavering determination in the face of great adversity is similar to the resilience of nature which continues to thrive even in the face of human neglect and disregard.
          </p>
          <p>
           Taking the example of nature, women too emerge stronger and more resilient from discrimination and oppression.
           <br/>
           I conclude saying that both pieces of literature remind us of the strength of human spirit and the importance of standing up for what we believe is right.
           <br/>
           Thank you.

           Dear Diary,
           <br/>
           I am feeling very down today. You know, everyone makes fun of me because I have a weak mind and a stammer. I am also called ugly as I have pock marks on my face. What hurts me the most is that my family members also tease me and neglect me! I don’t feel like talking to anyone now as I have become an object of neglect and laughter. It’s a pity that I have to suffer all this because of no fault of mine. I am slow to understand things because I fell from the cot when I was small. My face turned ugly as a result of the pock-marks I got due to smallpox.
          </p>
          <p>
           I hope somebody comes to my rescue and helps me to become a brave and confident girl ready to face the world.
           <br/>
           Take care!
           <br/>
           Bholi
          </p>
          <p>

           B. Richard Ebright displayed a well-rounded personality from his childhood. His genius was obvious by the time he was in second grade. He not only collected butterflies but also collected rocks, fossils and coins. He had managed to collect all the twenty-five species of butterflies that were found in his hometown and had classified them.
          </p>
          <p>
           Science was not his only passion. He was an active member of his school’s debating club and Model United Nations Clubs and was also an effective debater and public speaker. He was an enthusiastic canoeist and an all-round outdoor person with a keen interest in photography. Because of his interests and hobbies, it was simple for him to devote time and energy to many other interests. He was a champion, not because of his desire to win for the sake of winning but for attempting to do his best. All of these qualities make him a well-rounded personality.
