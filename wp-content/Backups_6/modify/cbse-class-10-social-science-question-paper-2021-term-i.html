           Question 44.
           <br/>
           Suppose there are four families in your locality, the average per capita income of whom is ₹10,000. If the income of three families is ₹6,000, ₹8000 and ₹14,000 respectively, what would be the income of the fourth family?
           <br/>
           (a) ₹5,000
           <br/>
           (b) ₹10,000
           <br/>
           (c) ₹12,000
           <br/>
           (d) ₹15,000
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (c) ₹12,000
           <br/>
           Explanation: Per capita Income = ₹10,000
           <br/>
           Total income of 4 people = ₹10,000 × 4 = ₹ 40,000
           <br/>
           Income of 3 people = ₹6,000 + ₹8,000 + ₹14,000 = ₹28,000
           <br/>
           ∴ Income of 4th family = ₹40,000 – ₹28,000 = ₹12,000

           Take the case of Laxmi with her two-hectare plot of unirrigated land. The government can spend some money or banks can provide a loan, to construct a well for her family to irrigate the land. Laxmi will then be able to irrigate her land and take a second crop, wheat, during the rabi season. Let us suppose that one hectare of wheat can provide employment to two people for 50 days (including sowing, watering, fertiliser application and harvesting). So . two more members of the family can be employed in her own field. Now suppose a new dam is constructed and canals are dug to irrigate many such farms. This could lead to a lot of employment generation within the agriculture sector itself reducing the problem of underemployment.
