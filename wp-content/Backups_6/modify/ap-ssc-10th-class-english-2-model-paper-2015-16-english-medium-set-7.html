           <br/>
           Other significant features of India’s cultural unity are the variety, colour and the emotional richness of its dances. The country abounds in tribal dances, old- dances as well as classical dances of great virtuosity. Throughout India, need is regarded not merely as an accompaniment to social intercourse, but also as a mode of aesthetic expression and spiritual realization.
           <br/>
           The great symbol of dance is Shiva, the Cosmic Dancer, depicted in sculpture and poetry as Nataraja. Similarly, the classical theatre in India has a history of more than two thousand years. It was performed in palaces and in temples. The classical plays combined music and dance. Tragedy was, and is, still discouraged otherwise; the range of themes covered is wide.
           <br/>
           It is this strand of cultural unity running through the country that we are heir to, and to which people in the West are increasingly turning now. It is up to the younger generation to uphold this torch of cultural unity for the rest of the world to see, follow and emulate, and not get dazed by the superficial prosperity and material achievement of the West. (Unity in Diversity)

           Working 12 to 18 hours a day was not uncommon for scientists at the rocket launching station, Thumba. A group of such scientists was frustrated due to the work pressure and meeting their boss’ demands; however, they were loyal to him.
           <br/>
           One day, a scientist gathered enough courage to go up to his boss and say “Sir, I have promised my children that I will take them to the exhibition this evening. Therefore, I have to leave the office at 5.30 p.m. Can I leave early today, Sir ? ” His boss replied, “Alright, you may leave early today.”
           <br/>
           The scientist was happy for having received the permission and went on to con­tinue in his work, that he peered at his watch only when he thought he was done.
           <br/>
           Unfortunately, it was past 8.15 p.m. With a jolt, he remembered his promise to his children. He looked for his boss who was not in his office. Having told him just that morning, he wrapped up work and hurried home.
           <br/>
           As he drove home, he felt very guilty for having let his children down. When he reached, the children were not at home. His wife was busy reading. He felt that initiating any conversation with her would only add fuel to fire, so he stayed quiet. Looking up at him, his wife asked, “Do you want something hot to drink or have dinner right away ?”
           <br/>
           The man could only ask, “Where are the children  His wile said, Don’t you know ? Your boss came here at 5.15 p.m. and took the children to the exhibition you had promised to take them to.” He was surprised, but it did not take him too long to guess what had happened.

            14.Read the following article on Global Warming and complete the flow chart given below.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Global warming is caused by the accumulation of Green House gases – CO , and methane in the atmosphere, resulting in the change of Earth’s overall surface temperature. India, a low latitude country, would face much of the misery due to climatic changes. Rainfall pattern is expected to undergo a major change in areas like Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and North East.
           <br/>
           Himalayan glaciers are melting. This could prove catastrophic for those living down stream in the plains. Due to global warming heat is trapped in the atmosphere causing the ice to melt. Rising sea levels would inundate many of the coastal cities.

           One day, Bribal and the Emperor Akbar – were having a ride on an elephant in the town. On their way, they came across a drunkard. The drunkard was standing in the middle of the road. Seeing an elephant before him, the intoxicated man shouted, “Hey, you owner of the elephant ! Will you sell this elephant to me ?”
           <br/>
           The Emperor was quite infuriated with the drunkard; but at that time, he kept quiet.
           <br/>
           The next day, the Emperor asked his guards to capture the drunkard and present him in the court. When he was brought, Emperor Akbar asked, “Well, do you wish to buy the elephant ?”
           <br/>
           The drunkard folded his hands and said, “Jahapanah ! Please forgive me. But the buyer of the elephant went away yesterday. I was but a mere middle man.”
           <br/>
           The Emperor’s anger vanished on hearing his clever reply. He said, “Tell me, one thing, who told you this idea ?”
           <br/>
           The drunkard said, “Maharaj, yesterday when I regained my consciousness, I was very much frightened. In the morning, when I was sitting sadly at my door­step, Birbalji saw me. He asked me why I looked so worried. When I told him, he gave this idea.”
           <br/>

            16.Read the following passage.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The most picturesque lake in the Kashmir Valley, the Dal lake, which skirts the capital Srinagar, is losing its charm. The lake, once described by Sir Walter Lawrence as the most beautiful spot in the world, is facing near extinction. Its pristine glory and gentle waters are fast turning into a fantasy.
           <br/>
           Sewage from the city flows unchecked and untreated into the once crystal clear waters of the lake as if shedding tears of blood over the present situation in the valley. The Dal waters have turned red. The culprit is the red toxic algae moss, euglena which hinders photosynthesis of the plants in the lake bed, thus signalling death to aquatic life. Euglena multiplies quickly and has a propensity to change colours. Between temperatures of 30 and 35 degrees C, it looks crimson red and below 30°C, it looks green. The unprecedented algae bloom is due to the unscien­tific and unmonitored deweeding by the authorities. The bloom which has a high organic content is responsible for gastro intestinal diseases. The water of the lake has turned acidic.
           <br/>
           With its vanishing charm the Dal’s size too has been under attack. Originally spread over 24 square kilometers, the lake has shrunk to less than 18 sq km today. To restore the Dal, several international organisations have come forward to help the State Government. But unless an awareness programme is taken up to make locals understand the importance of the lake, foreign aid can be of no avail.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Now answer the following questions.
           </strong>
           <br/>
