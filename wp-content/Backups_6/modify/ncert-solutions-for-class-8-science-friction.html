           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Alida runs her toy car on a dry marble floor, wet marble floor, newspaper and towel spread on the floor. The force of friction acting on the car on different surfaces in increasing order will be
           <br/>
           (a) wet marble floor, dry marble floor, newspaper and towel.
           <br/>
           (b) newspaper, towel, dry marble floor, wet marble floor.
           <br/>
           (c) towel, newspaper, dry marble floor, wet marble floor.
           <br/>
           (d) wet marble floor, dry marble floor, towel, newspaper.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) wet marble floor, dry marble floor, newspaper and towel.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Suppose your writing desk is tilted a little. A book kept on it starts sliding down. Show the direction of frictional force acting on it.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Frictional force will act upward, i.e., the direction opposite to that of sliding book.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           You spill a bucket of soapy water on a marble floor accidentally. Would it make it easier or more difficult for you to walk on the floor? Why?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The layer of soap makes the floor smooth due to which the friction is reduced. This makes the floor slippery and the foot cannot make a proper grip on the floor. Therefore it is difficult to walk on a soapy floor. We may slip on the floor.

           Question 6.
           <br/>
           Explain why sportsmen use shoes with spikes.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Sportsmen use shoes with spikes to increase the friction between shoes and the surface. So the shoes with spikes do not slip while the sportsmen run and play.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 7.
           <br/>
           Iqbal has to push a lighter box and Seema has to push a similar heavier box on the same floor. Who will have to apply a larger force and why?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A heavy object produces more friction as it is pressed hard against the opposite surface. So Seema will have to apply a larger force.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 8.
           <br/>
           Explain why sliding friction is less than static friction.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The sliding friction is less than static friction because the sliding object get less time to interlock into the contact points on the floor. So it is somewhat easier to move an object already in motion than to get it started.

           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Give examples to show that friction is both a friend and a foe.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Some points are given below which show that friction is both a friend and a foe:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Friction as a friend:
            <ul>
             <li>
              It allows us to grip and catch any object.
             </li>
             <li>
              It helps us to walk comfortably on the floor.
             </li>
             <li>
              It helps to minimise the speed or to stop any moving object.
             </li>
             <li>
              It helps us to write.
             </li>
            </ul>
           </li>
           <li>
            Friction as a foe:
            <ul>
             <li>
              It causes wear and tears in objects.
             </li>
             <li>
              It causes damage to the parts of machines and tools which further require money to get them repaired.
             </li>
             <li>
              It reduces the speed of moving objects, so more force is required.
             </li>
             <li>
              It produces hurdles in moving any object freely.
             </li>
            </ul>
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Explain why objects moving in fluids must have special shapes.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The objects moving in fluids must have a special shape to overcome the fluid friction acting on them. Efforts are therefore made to minimise the friction, so objects are given special shape having pointed fronts with little broader middle portion which gets tapered at the back called streamlined.

           Friction Class 8 Science NCERT Intext Activities Solved

          <p>
           Activity 1 (NCERT Textbook, Page 146)
           <br/>
           Gently push a book on a table [Fig. 12.2(a)]. You observe that it stops after moving for some distance. Repeat this activity pushing the book from the opposite direction [Fig. 12.2 (b)]. Does the book stop this time, too? Can you think of an explanation? Can we say that a force must be acting on the book opposing its motion? This force is called the force of friction.
           <br/>
           <img alt="NCERT Solutions for Class 8 Science Chapter 12 Friction Activity 1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-106818" height="195" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Science-Chapter-12-Friction-Activity-1.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Science-Chapter-12-Friction-Activity-1.png 498w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Science-Chapter-12-Friction-Activity-1-300x117.png 300w" width="498"/>
           <br/>
           Friction opposes relative motion between the surfaces of the book and the table
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Yes, the book stops this time too.
           <br/>
           After sliding for some time, the book stops. As the surface of the table provides the frictional force to oppose the sliding • of the book.
           <br/>
           Yes, we can say that a force must be acting on the book opposing its motion.
          </p>
          <p>
           Activity 2 (NCERT Textbook, Page 147)
           <br/>
           Tie a string around a brick. Pull the brick by a spring balance (Fig. 12.3). You need to apply some force. Note down the reading on the spring balance when the brick just begins to move. It gives you a measure of the force of friction between the surface of the brick and the floor.
           <br/>
           <img alt="NCERT Solutions for Class 8 Science Chapter 12 Friction Activity 2" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-106819" height="126" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Science-Chapter-12-Friction-Activity-2.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Science-Chapter-12-Friction-Activity-2.png 383w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Science-Chapter-12-Friction-Activity-2-300x99.png 300w" width="383"/>
           <br/>
           Now wrap a piece of polythene around the brick and repeat the activity. Do you observe any difference in the readings of the spring balance in the above two cases? What might be the reason for this difference? Repeat this activity by wrapping a piece of jute bag around the brick. What do you observe?
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           It is observed that the reading of the spring balance in the case when brick is wrapped with a piece of poly thene is less than the other cases.
           <br/>
           The reason for this difference could be that in the first case, since the brick surface in contact with the ground is rough, the surface gets greater force of friction. But in second case, when the brick is wrapped with polythene, the surface gets smoother. Hence, less frictional force is required to move it.
           <br/>
           By wrapping a piece of jute bag around the brick, it is observed that the reading of spring balance is more than the second
           <br/>
           case, when the brick was wrapped with polythene.

           <br/>
           Make an inclined plane on a smooth floor, or on a table. You may use a wooden board supported by bricks, or books. [Fig. 12.4 (a)]. Put a mark with a pen at any point A on the inclined plane. Now let a pencil cell move down from this point. How far does it move on the table before coming to rest? Note down the distance. Now spread a piece of cloth over the table. Make sure that there are no wrinkles in the cloth. Try the activity again [Fig. 12.4 (b)].

           The pencil cell covers different distances on different surfaces Repeat this activity by spreading a thin layer of sand over the table. Maintain the same slope throughout the activity.
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           The distance covered by the pencil cell is different every time because of the different amounts of friction provided by different surfaces. The distance covered with a thin layer of sand is least, as this surface provides the maximum friction.

           <br/>
           Take a few pencils which are cylindrical in shape. Place them parallel to each other on a table. Place a thick book over it (Fig. 12.5). Now push the book. You observe the pencils rolling as the book moves. Do you feel it easier to move the book in this way than to slide it? Do you think that resistance to the motion of the book has been reduced? Have you seen heavy machinery being moved by placing logs under it?

           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           It is observed that the book moves efficiently when placed on cylindrical pencils or rollers. It can be concluded that rolling friction is smaller than the sliding friction.

           </span>
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Friction is a friend in the following ways — it helps us to walk, to write on the blackboard and to apply the brakes of a car.
           </li>
           <li>
            Friction is a foe in the following ways — it causes wear and tear of machinery and shoes, it produces heat in the machinery.

            Question 2.
           </span>
           <br/>
           Why does friction increase if the two surfaces are pressed ?
           <br/>
           <span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer:
           </span>
           <br/>
           Since the friction is due to the interlocking of irregularities in the two surfaces which slide with respect to each other, it increases when the two surfaces are pressed harder.
          </p>

           <span style="color: #eb4924;">
            Question 3.
           </span>
           <br/>
           Why it is easier to move a box which is already moving than one which is at rest ?
           <br/>
           <span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer:
           </span>
           <br/>
           When the box starts sliding, the contact points on its surfaces, do not get enough time to lock, into the contact points on the floor. So, the sliding friction is slightly less than static friction.

           Why does a car stop when brakes are applied ?
           <br/>
           <span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer:
           </span>
           <br/>
           In cars, the friction is increased by using brake pads in the brake system. The brake pads do not touch the wheels but when we press the brake level, these pads arrest the motion of the run due to friction and the wheels stop moving.

            Answer:

           <br/>
           The labourer should put some cylindrical logs of wood under the trunk. In this way the area of contact between the two surfaces is reduced. Rolling friction is less than sliding friction.

            Answer:
           </span>
           <br/>
           The spaceships are sent into the space from the rockets with a very high speed. This creates a very high frictional force between the air and spaceship. As result, the spaceship gets heated to red hot. The heat resistant tiles save the spaceship from burning.
