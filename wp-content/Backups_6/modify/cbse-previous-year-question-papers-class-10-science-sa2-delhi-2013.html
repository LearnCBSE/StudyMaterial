            Question.3 Why should biodegradable and non-biodegradable wastes be discarded in two separate dustbins?
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Biodegradable and non-biodegradable wastes should be discarded in two separate dust¬bins because biodegradable waste is decomposed by the micro-organisms to form simple harmless substances which can be used as manures for the plants (e.g., in the potted plants in our garden/terrace garden). Non-biodegradable waste cannot be broken down naturally.

            Question.4 “The chromosomes number of the sexually reproducing parents and their offspring is the same.” Justify this statement.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           In sexual reproduction, though the genetic material DNA (in the form of chromosomes) from two gametes, male and female gametes, combines together to form a new cell ‘zygote’ but the amount of DNA (the number of chromosomes) in the zygote does not get
           <br/>
           doubled because gametes are the special type of cells called reproductive cells which contain only half the amount of DNA (or half the number of chromosomes) as compared to the normal body cells of an organism. So when a male gamete (having half number of chromosomes of the organism) combines with a female gamete (which also contain half the number of chromosomes) during sexual reproduction, then the new cell zygote will have the normal amount of DNA or normal number of chromosomes in it.

            Question.6 We often observe domestic waste decomposing in the bylanes of residential colonies. Suggest ways to make people realise that the improper disposal of waste is harmful to the environment.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            When the domestic waste is decomposed by the action of micro-organisms then it becomes the breeding place of flies and mosquitoes. Flies and mosquitoes are the carrier and vector of many dangerous diseases. So some posters related to the spread of such diseases can be pasted on the walls in public places to create awareness.
           </li>
           <li>
            There should be a strict fine imposed by the sanitary officer from the families which throw their domestic wastes on the roads.

            Answer.
           </strong>
           When ethanol is heated with excess of concentrated sulphuric acid at 443 K, it gets dehydrated to form ethene (an unsaturated hydrocarbon)
           <br/>
           <img alt="cbse-previous-year-question-papers-class-10-science-sa2-delhi-2013-2" height="59" loading="lazy" src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5577/30464160231_fc0cd69ebf_o.png" width="561"/>
           <br/>
           In this reaction, concentrated sulphuric acid acts as a dehydrating agent which removes water molecules from the ethanol molecule.

            (i) Any two adjacent homologues differ by 1 carbon and 2 hydrogen atoms in their molecular formulae. So the difference in molecular masses of any two adjacent homologues is 14 u. Thus the members of a homologous series show a gradual change in their physical properties with increase in molecular mass.

            There are seven periods in the modem periodic table.
           </li>
           <li>
            On moving from left to right in a period, the valency of elements increases from 1 to

           <br/>
           Thus the image is formed at a distance of 3.3 cm from the concave lens. The negative (-) sign for image distance shows that the image is formed on the left side of the concave lens (i.e., virtual). The size of the image is 2 cm and the positive (+) sign for hand image shows that the image is erect.
           <br/>
           Thus a virtual, erect, diminished image is formed on the same side of the object (i.e., left side).

            Question.17 State the difference in colours of the Sun observed during sunris^sunset and noon.

           <strong>
            Give explanation for each.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           The Sim and surrounding sky appear red at sunrise and at sunset because at this time the Sun is near the horizon and sunlight has to travel the greatest distance through the atmosphere to reach us. Thus most of the blue colour present in sunlight has been scattered out and away from our line of sight, leaving behind mainly red colour in the direct sunlight beam that reaches our eyes.
           <br/>
           When the Sun is overhead (as at noon) then the light coming from the Sun has to travel a relatively shorter distance through the atmosphere to reach us. Thus only a little of blue colour of the white light is scattered. Since the light coming from the overhead Sun has almost all its component colours in the right proportion, therefore the Sun in the sky overhead appears white.

           <strong>
            (b) We do not clean ponds or lakes, but an aquarium needs to be cleaned regularly. Explain.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           (a) An ecosystem is a self-contained unit of living things (plants, animals and decomposers) and their non-living environment (soil, air and water). An ecosystem needs only the input of sunlight energy for its functioning.
           <br/>
           The two main components of an ecosystem are:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Abiotic component. It includes all non-living components like soil, water, air temperature, light, pressure, etc.
           </li>
           <li>
            Biotic component. It includes all living components like plants, animals, decomposers, etc.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (b) A pond is a self sufficient or independent unit in nature. It contains all the components of the ecosystem. In this ecosystem, producers (hydrophytes) trap the solar energy and then provide the basic food or energy for all other life in the pond. When the producers and consumers die, the decomposers present in the pond act on their dead bodies to return the various elements back to the nutrient pool.
           <br/>
           On the other hand, in an aquarium there are not any. producers and nutrient pool to trap solar energy, therefore the fishes living in an aquarium need to be nourished. Moreover due to absence of decomposers the excreta of the fishes cannot be decomposed. Therefore the aquarium needs to be cleaned regularly.

           <br/>
           (b) Reason. There is always a possibility of diversity of characters in the off springs because the offspring is formed as a result of fusion of two gametes produced by two different individuals—the male and the female parents. So there is an opportunity for new combinations of characters.

           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           (a)
           <br/>
           A—Stigma. The top part of carpel is called stigma. Stigma is for receiving the pollen grains from the anther of stamen during pollination.
           <br/>
           B—Pollen tube. When a pollen grain falls on the stigma, it bursts open and grows a pollen tube downward through the style towards the female gamete in the ovary. A male gamete moves down the pollen tube.
           <br/>
           C—Female gamete (ovum). It is a special reproductive female sex cell which combines with male gamete to form zygote.
           <br/>
           (b) Sexual reproduction takes place by the combination of special reproductive cells called sex cells. These cells are of two types —male sex cells and female sex cells, which are coming from two different parents—a male and a female. The cells involved in sexual reproduction are called gametes. In sexual reproduction, a male gamete fuses with a female gamete to form a new cell called zygote. This zygote then grows and develops into a new organism in due course of time.

           (b) We have seen advertisements in media persuading people for eye donation. If cornea of the eyes are removed within 6 hours of the death of a person, it can be transplanted to a person suffering from corneal blindness. There are more than 45 lakh cases of corneal blindness and unfortunately out of these a major portion is that of children aged below 12 years. If a person comes forward for eye donation, he can save two corneal blind persons by donating one eye to each.

           <br/>
           (b) (i) Most metallic element is Na. Most non-metallic element is Cl;
           <br/>
           Because on moving from left to right in a period the nuclear charge increases thus the valence electrons are pulled in more strongly by the nucleus and it becomes more and more difficult for the atoms to lose electrons so tendency of atoms to lose electrons (i e., metallic character) decreases on moving from left to right in a period. On the other hand, due to increased nuclear charge, it becomes easier for the atoms to gain electrons. So the tendency to gain electrons (i.e. non-metallic character) increases on moving from left to right in a period.
           <br/>
           (c) Cl is more non-metallic from S because on moving from left to right in a period,
           <br/>
           nuclear charge increases so the tendency to gain electrons increases (i.e., non-metallic character).
           <br/>
           (d) Cl has higher atomic mass because on moving from left to right in a period, atomic number increases. Simultaneously, atomic mass increases.

           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           When a ray of light passes through a prism, it under goes refraction twice. First from rarer to denser medium of glass, it bends towards normal which is towards the base of the prism. Second time from denser to rarer medium, i.e., glass to air, it bends away from the normal i.e., towards the base of the prism.

           <li>
            We can reduce the wastage of water by repairing the leakage in taps.
           </li>
           <li>
            We should collect all the discarded household items like newspapers, broken plastic items, glass bottles etc. and send them to the respective industries for recycling to make fresh paper, plastic and glass objects.

           <br/>
           (a) All these elements belong to 1st group because all elements have one electron in their respective outermost shell.

           (b) Li is least reactive as reactivity of metals decreases on going down in a group.
           <br/>
           (c) K has the largest atomic radius because Li belongs to 2nd period thus has 2 energy shells, Na belongs to the 3rd period thus has 3 energy shells and K belongs to 4th period thus has 4 energy shells. So as the number of shells increases so does the size of the atom.

           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           The remains or impressions of extinct animals or plants that lived in the remote past are known as fossils.
           <br/>
           Importance of fossils:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Fossils provide evidence for evolution, e.g., a fossil bird called Archaeopteryx looks like a bird but it has many features which are found in reptiles. Archaeopteryx has feathered wings like birds but teeth and tail like those of reptiles. Therefore Archaeopteryx is a connecting link between the reptiles and birds and hence suggests that the Birds have evolved from the reptiles.
           </li>
           <li>
            Habits and behaviour of extinct species can be inferred. For example, the estimation of age of dinosaur fossils have told that they first appeared on earth about 250 million years ago and became extinct about 65 million years ago.
           </li>
           <li>
            Fossils provide direct evidence of past life.
           </li>
           <li>
            With the help of fossils broad historical sequence of biological evolution can be built up.

           The negative (-) sign for image distance shows the image is formed on the left side of the concave lens, i.e., it is virtual.

            When the uterus receives the zygote, zygote divides rapidly by mitosis and forms a hollow ball of hundreds of cells called embryo which gets embedded in the thick lining of the uterus. This process is called implantation. After implantation, a disc like special tissue develops between the uterus wall and the embryo which is called placenta. The exchange of nutrients, oxygen and waste products between the embryo and the mother takes place through placenta.

           <li>
            If zygote is not received by the uterus, then the thick and soft uterus lining having lot of blood cappillaries in it is not required. The unfertilised ovum dies within a day and the uterus lining also breaks down. The breaking of the uterus lining produces blood along with tissues in the form of bleeding through the vagina. This vaginal bleeding is called menstrual flow or menstruation.

           <br/>
           <strong>
            In which of these four media is the speed of light (i) minimum and (ii) maximum? Find the refractive index of medium C with respect to medium B.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           When light is going from vacuum to another medium, then the value of refractive index is called absolute refractive index to the medium.
           <br/>
           The absolute refractive index of diamond is 2.42. It means that the speed of light in diamond is 1/2.42 times the speed of light in vacuum.
           <br/>
           As the refractive indices increase, speed of the light decreases in the medium.
           <br/>
           (i) The refractive index of medium D is maximum (1.65). So the speed of light in medium D is minimum.
           <br/>
           (ii) The refractive index of medium A is minimum (1.33). So the speed of light in medium A is maximum.
