            Answer.
           </strong>
           Participation rate for women is higher in rural areas compared with urban areas. It is because in rural areas, poverty forces women to seek employment. Without education, women in rural areas find only less productive jobs and get low wages.
           <br/>
           In urban areas, men are able to earn high incomes. So they discourage female members from taking up jobs.

            Answer.
           </strong>
           In 1972-73, out of total workforce of 234 million, 195 million was in rural areas and 39 million in urban areas. It shows 83% workforce lived in rural areas. Gender differences were also observed. In rural areas, males accounted for 125 million workforce and women 70 million of workforce. In urban areas, 32 million males formed the workforce whereas women workforce was only 7 million. In the country only 77 million female workers were there as compared to 157 million male workers. In other words, 32% of female workers were there and 68% male workers were there in the country in 1972-73. The data shows:
           <br/>
           (a) pre dominance of agriculture.
           <br/>
           (b) more male workers both in urban and rural areas.
           <br/>
           (c) less female workers in both rural and urban areas. Also, female workers were much lesser in urban areas.

            Answer.
           </strong>
           Estimated number of workers (in crores) for urban =\(\frac { 28.52 }{ 100 }\) x 33.7 = 9.61 crores
           <br/>
           Total workforce = 30.12 + 9.61 = 39.73 crores

            Question 13. Why are regular salaried employees more in urban areas than in rural areas?
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           In urban areas, a considerable section is able to study in various educational institutions. Urban people have a variety of employment opportunities. They are able to look for an appropriate job to suit their qualifications and skills.J3ut in rural areas, people cannot stay at home as they are economically poor.

            Question 14. Why are less women found in regular salaried employment?
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Female workers give preference to self-employment than to hired employment. It is because women, both in rural and urban areas, are less mobile and thus, prefer to engage themselves in self-employment.

            Question 15. Analyse the recent trends in sectoral distribution of workforce in India.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           l.The data in occupational structure is as follows (for the year 1999-2000):
           <br/>
           (a) Industry wise the distribution is:
           <br/>
           (i) 37.1% of workforce is engaged in primary sector.
           <br/>
           (ii) 18.7% of workforce is engaged in secondary sector.
           <br/>
           (iii) 44.2% of workforce is engaged in tertiary sector.
           <br/>
           (b) Area wise the data is:
           <br/>
           (i) In rural areas:
           <br/>
           77% of workforce is in primary sector.
           <br/>
           11% of workforce is in secondary sector.
           <br/>
           12% of workforce is in tertiary sector.
           <br/>
           (ii) In urban areas:
           <br/>
           10% of workforce is in primary sector.
           <br/>
           31% of workforce is in secondary sector.
           <br/>
           59% of workforce is in tertiary sector.
           <br/>
           2. The data reveals that:
           <br/>
           (a) Economic backwardness in the country as 60% of workforce is engaged in agricultural activities. A large proportion of population depend on agriculture for their livelihood.
           <br/>
           (b) In urban area, tertiary sector account for 59% of workforce. It shows development and growth in the tertiary sector and the fact that this sector is able to generate sustainable employment and provide livelihood to 59% of the workforce.
           <br/>
           3. It can be concluded that in the urban areas, tertiary sector is the main source of livelihood for majority of workforce.

            Question 16. Compared to the 1970s, ’there has hardly been any change in the distribution of workforce across various industries. Comment.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           It is true that no much change is observed in the distribution of workforce across various industries. It is because the plans did not emphasise the need for development of:
           <br/>
           (a) non-agricultural rural employment industries.
           <br/>
           (b) small scale, village and cottage industries.

           <strong>
            Question 17. Do you think that in the last 50 years, employment generated in the country is commensurate with the growth of GDP in India? How?
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Jobless growth is defined as a situation in which there is an overall acceleration in the growth rate of GDP in the economy which is not accompanied by a commensurate expansion in employment opportunities.This means that in an economy, without generating additional employment we have been able to produce more goods and services. Since the starting of economic reforms in 1991, our economy is experiencing a gap between GDP growth rate and employment growth rate that is, jobless growth.

           <strong>
            Question 18. Is it necessary to generate employment in the formal sector rather than in the informal sector? Why?
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           With economic reforms in 1991, there has been significant rise in informalisation of workers. Since informal workers face uncertainties of making of living, it is surprising that such a high percentage of total workforce prefer to be employed in the informal sector. All necessary steps should be taken to generate employment in the formal sector, which is only 7% at present.
