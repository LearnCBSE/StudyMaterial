          </h2>
          <p>
           <strong>
            1. Past Adjustments
           </strong>
           Sometimes, after the final accounts of a firm have been closed, it is found that certain matters have been left out by mistake. In such cases, instead of altering the final accounts which have already been closed, the firm rectifies the error or omission by passing an adjustment entry in the beginning of the financial year. Such adjustments are called past adjustments as they relate to past period.
           <br/>
           Steps to pass adjusting journal entry:
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Step 1
           </strong>
           Calculate the amount already recorded.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Step 2
           </strong>
           Calculate the amount which should have been recorded.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Step 3
           </strong>
           Calculate the difference between Step 1 and Step 2.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Step 4
           </strong>
           Find out the partner who received excess and the partner who received short.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Step 5
           </strong>
           Pass the adjusting journal entry by debiting the partner who received excess and by crediting the partner who received short.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            2. Guarantee
           </strong>
           A partner may be admitted into the firm with a guarantee of minimum profit, which means that if his share of profit is less than that of guaranteed profit, then he would be paid the guaranteed share of profit.
           <br/>
           The deficiency (difference between guaranteed profit and actual profit) is borne by partner or partners who have guaranteed the profit in agreed ratio.
           <br/>
           Different conditions regarding guarantee of profit are:
           <br/>
           (i) Guarantee by the firm to a partner.
           <br/>
           (ii) Guarantee by one partner to another partner.
           <br/>
           (iii) Guarantee given by the partner to the firm.
           <br/>
           (iv) Simultaneous guarantee by the firm to the partner and by the partner to the firm.
           <strong>
            Steps Involved in the Distribution of Profits under Guarantee Arrangement
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Step 1
           </strong>
           Calculate the actual share of profit/loss of guaranteed partner.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Step 2
           </strong>
           Calculate the guaranteed amount.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Step 3
           </strong>
           Calculate the amount of deficiency
           <br/>
           Deficiency = Guaranteed Amount – Actual Share of Profit
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Step 4
           </strong>
           Distribute the deficiency among the guaranteeing partners in their guaranteeing ratio.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Step 5
           </strong>
           Distribute the actual profits/losses among all the partners in their profit sharing ratio as if there is no guarantee arrangement.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Step 6
           </strong>
           Recover share of deficiency (as per step 3) from the guaranteeing partners and give credit for the same to guaranteed partner.
