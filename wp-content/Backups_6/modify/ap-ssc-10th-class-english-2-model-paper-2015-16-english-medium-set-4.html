           Once there lived a king. He was extremely fond of hunting. His ministers, very often, advised him not to kill innocent animals. The king did not pay heed. One day, a lion attacked him. He struck the lion with his sharp arrows. The lion was seriously wounded. Before falling dead to the ground, he struck the king’s right arm with a great force. Half of the flesh of the arm was peeled off. The royal surgeons amputated the arm to save the king’s life. The king grumbled against fate. He cursed god.     .
           <br/>
           After two years, the king went out hunting. He lost his way in the thick forest. Some wild people caught hold of him. They were in search of a man to offer him as a sacrifice to the Forest God. The head priest saw the king. He said to his people, “The man is not worthy enough to be given as a sacrifice. He is not complete in body. He has no right arm. Leave him.” The people left the king. Then the king realised that the loss of his right arm had saved his life. He thanked God. He did not hunt again in his life.

            16.Read the following passage carefully :
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Hibernation is more than sleep. It is a very deep sleep. In warm countries, where the winters are not very long or very cold, hibernation is not necessary. And in very cold parts of the world, like the far north of Russia, not many animals hibernate; the ground is so hard that they cannot make a deep hole to spend the winter in. But animals in large part of the northern hemisphere spend every winter fast asleep. They go to sleep in all kinds of places. Red squirrels disappear inside trees, bears use caves, frogs go deep under the mud and very many other animals dig tunnels in the earth. Some animals sleep under the snow, there is a lot of air in loose snow, and this helps to keep the cold out. Some warm-blooded animals like the cat, the dog or the wolf, do not need to hibernate. They lead an active life which keeps up their usual body temperature even in very cold winter weather. But for cold-blooded creatures such as a frog or a snake it is a different matter. When the air tempera­ture is below freezing, the creature’s blood temperature drops too, it cannot move about in the usual way. And then it has no choice. It must simply lie down and sleep.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Now answer the following questions.

           <br/>
           One day, Rahim went to the King and complained. “Hussain has stolen a silver bowl from my house.” The King asked Hussain to be brought to the court. He said to the King, “My Lord, I am honest. I did not steal the bowl. Ask Rahim to prove that I stole it.” “My lord, we can put his honesty to the test. I’ll put a piece of red-hot iron in his hands. If he can hold it in his hands, that will prove his honesty.” said Rahim.                                                                                         •
           <br/>
           The King saw that Rahim really wanted to hurt Hussain. So he said to Rahim, “If what you say is the truth, then you can prove it by holding the piece of red-hot iron yourself.”

           Rahim now became afraid. He told the King, “My lord, I’ll go home and look for the bowl once again.” And he left the court hastily.

           Complaint against Kondiba and his companions over my father’s death.
           <br/>
           I am N. Suman, a resident of Vairagad village of Chikhli Tehsil, Buldana District. I wish to bring the following details to your kind notice hoping the you will take necessary action.
           <br/>
           You already know that the day before yesterday at the time of the house-warming function, the storeyed house built by my father out of his retirement benefits was burnt. When my father, Bayaji, tried to bring the photographs back from the burning house, he was caught in the fire and died unfortunately. The village officers came and concluded that my father’s death was the result of an accident due to a petromax flare-up.
           <br/>
           But the report was quite false. We all strongly believe that Kondiba, the village headman and his companions were responsible for the incident. Kondiba did not like my father’s intention of building a storeyed house in the village. He felt jealous and warned my father not to build the storeyed house. He threatened my father to leave the village, if he wanted to build a storeyed house. On the day of house warming ceremony, Kondiba refused to accept the betel leaves offered by my father. Later he with his companions moved from the place seriously and angrily. After some time the house was on fire from the four sides.
           <br/>
           We strongly think that what we believe is right. We complain that Kondil^a and his companions were the responsible people for the incident. So I request you to please inquire them and bring out the truth to do justice for us.
           <br/>
           Yours faithfully,

           Once there lived a king. He was extremely fond of hunting. His ministers, very often, advised him not to kill innocent animals. The king did not pay heed. One day, a lion attacked him. He struck the lion with his sharp arrows. The lion was seriously wounded. Before falling dead to the ground, he struck the king’s right arm with a great force. Half of the flesh of the arm was peeled off. The royal surgeons amputated the arm to save the king’s life. The king grumbled against fate. He cursed god.     .
           <br/>
           After two years, the king went out hunting. He lost his way in the thick forest. Some wild people caught hold of him. They were in search of a man to offer him as a sacrifice to the Forest God. The head priest saw the king. He said to his people, “The man is not worthy enough to be given as a sacrifice. He is not complete in body. He has no right arm. Leave him.” The people left the king. Then the king realised that the loss of his right arm had saved his life. He thanked God. He did not hunt again in his life.

           </strong>
           <br/>
           Hibernation is more than sleep. It is a very deep sleep. In warm countries, where the winters are not very long or very cold, hibernation is not necessary. And in very cold parts of the world, like the far north of Russia, not many animals hibernate; the ground is so hard that they cannot make a deep hole to spend the winter in. But animals in large part of the northern hemisphere spend every winter fast asleep. They go to sleep in all kinds of places. Red squirrels disappear inside trees, bears use caves, frogs go deep under the mud and very many other animals dig tunnels in the earth. Some animals sleep under the snow, there is a lot of air in loose snow, and this helps to keep the cold out. Some warm-blooded animals like the cat, the dog or the wolf, do not need to hibernate. They lead an active life which keeps up their usual body temperature even in very cold winter weather. But for cold-blooded creatures such as a frog or a snake it is a different matter. When the air tempera­ture is below freezing, the creature’s blood temperature drops too, it cannot move about in the usual way. And then it has no choice. It must simply lie down and sleep.
