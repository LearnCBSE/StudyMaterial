           Question 7.
           <br/>
           Why is the classical (Rutherford) model for an atom—of electron orbitting around the nucleus—not able to explain the atomic structure? (All India 2012)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           As the revolving electron loses energy continuously, it must spiral inwards and eventually fall into the nucleus. So it was not able to explain the atomic structure.

           Question 8.
           <br/>
           When is Ha line of the Balmer series in the emission spectrum of hydrogen atom obtained? (Comptt. Delhi 2012)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Balmer series is obtained when an electron jumps to the second orbit (n
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           = 2) from any orbit n
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           = n &gt; 2 .

          <p>
           Question 9.
           <br/>
           What is the maximum number of spectral lines emitted by a hydrogen atom when it is in the third excited state? (Comptt. All India 2012)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           For third excited state, n
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           = 4, and n
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           = 3, 2, 1 Hence there are 3 spectral lines.

           Question 14.
           <br/>
           Using Bohr’s postulates of the atomic model, derive the expression for radius of nth electron orbit. Hence obtain the expression for Bohr’s radius. (All India 2012)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Basic postulates of Bohr’s atomic model:
           <br/>
           (i) Every atom consists of a central core called nucleus in which entire positive charge and mass of the atom are concentrated. A suitable number of electrons revolve around the nucleus in circular orbit. The centripetal force required for revolution is provided by the electrostatic force of attraction between the electron and the nucleus.
           <br/>
           (ii) Electron can resolve only in certain discrete non-radiating orbits, called stationary orbit. Total angular momentum of the revolving electron in an integral multiple of h/2π.
           <br/>
           … where [h is plank constant]
           <br/>
           <img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 12 Atoms Class 12 Important Questions 11" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-115835" height="44" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-12-Atoms-Class-12-Important-Questions-11.png" width="94"/>
           <br/>
           (iii) The radiation of energy occurs only when an electron jumps from one permitted orbit to another. The difference in the total energy of electron in the two permitted orbit is absorbed when the electron jumps from inner to the outer orbit and emitted when electron jumps from outer to inner orbit.

           <br/>
           Also, according to Bohr’s postulates, the centripetal force is equal to electrostatic force between the electron and nucleus.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           Important limitations of Rutherford Model :
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            According to Rutherford model, electron orbiting around the nucleus, continuously radiates energy due to the acceleration; hence the atom will not remain stable.
           </li>
           <li>
            As electron spirals inwards; its angular velocity and frequency change continuously; therefore it. will emit a continuous spectrum.

           Question 40.
           <br/>
           (a) Using Bohr’s second postulate of quantization of orbital angular momentum show that the circumference of the electron in the n,h orbital state in hydrogen atom is n times the de-Broglie wavelength associated with it.
           <br/>
           (b) The electron in hydrogen atom is initially in the third excited state. What is the maximum number of spectral lines which can be emitted when it finally moves to the ground state? (Delhi 2012)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) According to the de-Broglie hypothesis, this electron is also associated with wave character.
           <br/>
           Hence a circular orbit can be taken to be a stationary energy state only if it contains an integral number of de- Broglie wavelengths i.e. we must have

           Question 58.
           <br/>
           Draw a schematic arrangement of the Geiger-Marsden experiment. How did the scattering of α-particles by a thin foil of gold provide an important way to determine an upper limit on the size of the nucleus? Explain briefly.

           <img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 12 Atoms Class 12 Important Questions 78" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-115903" height="272" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-12-Atoms-Class-12-Important-Questions-78.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-12-Atoms-Class-12-Important-Questions-78.png 417w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-12-Atoms-Class-12-Important-Questions-78-300x196.png 300w" width="417"/>
           <br/>
           (i) Beam of α-particles get deviated at various angles with different probabilities.
           <br/>
           (ii) α-particles with least impact parameter suffers larger scattering – rebounding on head on collision.
           <br/>
           (iii) For larger impact parameter, the particle remains almost undeviated.
          </p>
          <p>
           Explanation:
           <br/>
           The fact that the number of incident particles rebounding back is only a small of fraction, means that numer of α-particles headon collision is small. This implies that the entire positive charge of the atom is concentrated in a small volume. This confirms that the nucleus of the atom has an apper size limit.

           Question 60.
           <br/>
           Using Bohr’s postulates, derive the expression for the frequency of radiation emitted when electron in hydrogen atom undergoes transition from higher energy state (quantum number n
           <sub>
            i
           </sub>
           ) to the lower state (n
           <sub>
            f
           </sub>
           ).
           <br/>
           When electron in hydrogen atom jumps from energy state n
           <sub>
            i
           </sub>
           = 4 to n
           <sub>
            f
           </sub>
           = 3, 2, 1, identify the spectral series to which the emission lines belong. (All India 2013)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When a hydrogen atom receives energy by process such as electron collisions of heat, the atom may acquire sufficient energy to raise the electron to higher energy states from n = 1 to n = 2, it is said to be in an excited state. When an electron falls back from excited state to lower energy state by emitting, there is a photon of particular energy and of particular frequency.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Limitations of Rutherford Model :
           <br/>
           (i) Electrons moving in a circular orbit around the nucleus would get, accelerated, therefore it would spiral into the nucleus, as it looses its energy.
           <br/>
           (ii) It must emit a continuous spectrum.
          </p>
          <p>
           Explanation according to Bohr’s model of hydrogen atom :
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) Electron in an atom can revolve in certain stable orbits without the emission of radiant energy.
           <br/>
           (ii) Energy is released/absorbed only, when an electron jumps from one stable orbit to another stable orbit. This results in a discrete spectrum.
