          </div>
          <p>
           (iii)Â Shifting cultivation is the type of farming in which agricultural activities are shifted from one field to another when the fertility of the soil of the former is diminished
           <br/>
           Disadvantages:
          </p>
          <ul>

            Soil erosion
           </li>
           <li>
            Small patches for cultivation
           </li>
           <li>
            Not sufficient for feeding a large population.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (iv) Plantation agriculture is a type of commercial farming where only a single crop (like tea, coffee, sugarcane, cashew, rubber, banana or cotton) is grown. A large amount of labour and capital are required. The product is processed on the farm itself or nearby factories.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) Two major fiber crops are jute and cotton. Jute grows well on alluvial soil and requires high temperature, heavy rainfall, and a humid climate for its growth. Cotton needs high temperatures, light rainfall, and bright sunshine for its proper growth.

           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Give reasons.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Agriculture is an activity of growing crops, fruits, vegetables, flowers, and rearing of livestock. It is a primary activity since it directly involves natural resources. In India, a huge number of people derive the activity from their ancestors. Due to lack of literacy in general, farmers prefer agriculture since they acquire the required skills from their ancestors, and so feel comfortable with it.

           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Find out the difference between the lifestyle of farmers in the USA and India on the basis of pictures collected from magazines, books, newspapers and the internet.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The lifestyle of an Indian farmer is quite different from that of a farmer in the USA. An Indian farmer does not have much land whereas the average size of a farm in the USA is about 250 hectares. An Indian farmer lives in his house but an American farmer lives in his farm. A farmer in India applies his own experience, and advice of other farmers and elders regarding farming practices. But a farmer in the USA gets his soil tested in laboratories to assess the nutrients of the soil. An Indian farmer does not know of any technical advancements whereas a farmer in the USA has a computer which is linked to the satellite. In comparison to an Indian farmer, an American farmer is much more advanced in every aspect.

           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Explain shifting cultivation.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Shifting cultivation is a class of primitive subsistence agriculture. In this, a plot of land is cleared by the farmer. This is done by felling the trees and burning them. The ashes are then mixed with soil and crops are grown. After some time, the land is abandoned and the farmer moves to a different place. This type of farming is common in the thickly forested areas of the Amazon basin, tropical Africa, parts of south-east Asia, and north-east India. It is also called âslash and burnâ agriculture, because of the process of felling and burning the trees is involved.

           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Enlist the climate conditions required for the proper cultivation of rice. Mention the main regions of its production.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Rice is a major food cropâin tropical and sub-tropical parts of the world. Its cultivation needs high temperatures, high humidity and rainfall. Its growth is best in alluvial clayey soils since they have water retention capacity. China and India are the leading producers in the world. In favourable climatic conditions, even two to three crops are grown in a year.

           Question 5.
           <br/>
           What do you understand by agricultural development?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Agricultural development refers to efforts made to increase production in farms so as to meet the everÂ¬growing demand of the population. The activities that come under this development are increasing the cropped area, growing more crops, improving irrigation, using fertilizers, sowing HYV (high-yielding variety) of seeds, and promoting mechanization. Mechanization ensures that little labor is done by the farmers; instead, machines are used to provide efficiency.

           Class 8 Geography Chapter 4 Agriculture Long Answer Type Questions
          </h4>
          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Describe subsistence farming and its types in detail.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The two main types of farming are:
           <br/>
           subsistence farming and commercial farming.
           <br/>
           Subsistence farming is practised solely to meet the needs of the farmerâs family. Therefore, the practices involved are usually old- fashioned. Use of modern technology is minimum and most work is done by household labour.
          </p>
          <p>
           In intensive, subsistence agriculture, simple tools and huge labour are used by a farmer to cultivate a small plot of land. More than one crop is grown annually in favourable conditions. Rice is the major crop. This form of agriculture is seen in the thickly populated areas of the monsoon regions of south, south-east and east Asia. Shifting cultivation is a class of primitive subsistence agriculture. In this, a plot of land is cleared by felling the trees and burning them.
          </p>
          <p>
           The ashes are then mixed with soil and crops are grown. After some time, the land is abandoned and the farmers move to a different place. This type of farming is common in the thickly forested areas of the Amazon basin, tropical Africa, parts of south-east Asia and north-east India. It is also called âslash and burnâ agriculture.
          </p>
          <p>
           Nomadic herding refers to the practice in which herdsmen move from place to place with their animals for fodder and water. Animals usually reared are the yak, sheep, camel and goats.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Describe commercial farming and its types in detail.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Commercial farming is the practice in which crops are grown exclusively for commercial purpose, i.e. for sale in the market. A large area is cultivated and huge capital is involved unlike subsistence farming. Machines are used to a large extent.
           <br/>
           Commercial grain farming is a class of commercial farming. Crops like wheat and maize are grown for commercial purpose. The temperate grasslands of North America, Europe and Asia are some common areas where it is seen.
          </p>
          <p>
           Mixed farming is another type of commercial farming. The land is used for growing food and fodder crops and rearing livestock. Some areas where it is followed are Europe, eastern USA, Argentina, south-east Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Plantations are a type of commercial farming where only a single crop (like tea, coffee, sugarcane, cashew, rubber, banana or cotton) is grown. Large amount of labour and capital are required. The produce is processed in the farm itself or nearby factories.
