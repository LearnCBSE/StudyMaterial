            Dr. Manmohan Singh’s statement in the Rajya Sabha.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Four thousand people were killed in this great national tragedy that took place in 1984. This should be an occasion for introspection of how working together as a united nation, we can find new pathways to ensure that such ghastly tragedies never again take place in our country. I have no hesitation in apologizing not only to the Sikh community, but to the whole Indian nation. Because, what took place in 1984 is the negation of the concept of nationhood and what is enshrined in our Constitution. So, lam not standing on my false prestige. On behalf of our government, on behalf of the entire people of this country, I bow my head in shame that such a thing took place. But sir, there are ebbs and there are tides in the affairs of nations. The past is with us. We cannot rewrite the past. But as human beings, we have the willpower and we have the ability to write a better future for all of us.

            1. Why do you think the young Chinese wanted to fight both against old traditional practices and against foreign powers?

           <br/>
           <strong>
            A.
           </strong>
           1. The traditional China rulers had been kings and emperors who did not sympathise with ideas of democracy and freedom. They were not in a position to free China from the hands Europeans.
           <br/>
           2.The European powers had carved out their spheres of influence’ in different parts of China and had forced the emperors to give their economic and political concessions. So the young Chinese wanted to fight both against old trational practices and against foreign powers.

            A .
           </strong>
           The great depression began around the end of 1929 and lasted almost till 1939 when the World War-11 began. There was a sudden fall in the American stock market.
           <br/>
           This effected almost all the nations in the world. Roosevelt, the US president, announced ‘The New Deal’ which promised Relief to the victims of Depression. However, the real break came from the outbreak of war. When state expenditure on armies and arnaments suddenly increased giving a big boost to factory production and demand for farm produce. Thus the Second World War helped USA grow out of its economic misery from the great depression.

           <br/>
           <strong>
            A.
           </strong>
           The major highlight of this period was the 42nd Constitutional Amendment which brought about a series of changes. It had the following aims: a) Excluding the courts from election disputes; b) Strengthening the central government vis-a-vis the state governments; c) Providing maximum protection from judicial challenges to social and economic transformation legislation; d) Making the judiciary subservient to parlia­ment. While the supposed aim of the Amendment was to protect social and economic development from judiciary, strengthen national unity and so on, in reality it actually weakened the democratic fabric of this country.
