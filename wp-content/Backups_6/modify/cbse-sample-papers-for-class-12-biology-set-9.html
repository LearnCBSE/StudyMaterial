           Question 13.
           <br/>
           Assertion (A) : The embryo with 6 to 8 blastomeres is called a morula.
           <br/>
           Reason (R) : The morula continues to divide and transforms into trophoblast.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (c) Assertion is true, but Reason is false.
          </p>
          <p>
           The embryo with 6 to 8 blastomeres is called a morula. The morula continues to divide and transforms into blastocyst as it moves further into the uterus.
           <br/>
           The blastomeres in the blastocysts are arranged into an outer layer called trophoblast and an inner group of cells attached to trophoblast called the inner cell mass.

           Question 14.
           <br/>
           Assertion (A) : AUG acts as a start codon for the nucleotide sequence.
           <br/>
           Reason (B) : AUG codes for methionine and starts the process.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion.
          </p>
          <p>
           AUG is the codon which is known as start codon. This codon is present as the first codon in the mRNA. This is the site from where the translation process starts to form the protein from the segment of mRNA.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion.
          </p>
          <p>
           Streptococcus thermophilus is widely used as starter to produce curd and yoghurt from milk.
           <br/>
           This bacterium, while carrying out the curdling of milk, increases its vitamin content. Thus, curd and yoghurt are nutritionally rich and have higher vitamin content than milk.

           Question 16.
           <br/>
           Assertion (A) : Tropical rainforests are disappearing fastly from developing countries such as India.
           <br/>
           Reason (R) : No value is attached to these forests because these are poor in biodiversity.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (c) Assertion is true, but Reason is false.
          </p>
          <p>
           Tropical rainforests are disappearing fastly from developing countries such as India. Forests lands are converting into agricultural and industrial lands to fulfill the requirement of increasing population.
           <br/>
           I Therefore, humans are the main cause of rainforest destruction. Tropical rainforests are rich in biodiversity.

           <br/>
           Give an example of a gene responsible for multiple phenotypic expressions. What are such genes called? State the cause that is responsible for such an effect.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) The strength of linkage is higher in the cross A than in cross B because linkage is higher when two genes are present closely on the same chromosome than those genes which are far apart.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) In cross B, the chances of crossing over or recombination are higher because the genes are loosely linked.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Pleiotropy is the phenomenon in which a single gene exhibits multiple phenotypic expressions. The genes exhibiting pleiotropy are called pleiotropic genes.
          </p>
          <p>
           Pleiotropism occurs mainly because of mutation in a particular gene, e.g. In garden pea, starch synthesis, size of starch grains and shape of seeds is controlled by the single gene. The genotypes and phenotypes of the trait are as follows.
          </p>
          <p>
           BB-Round seeds, large starch grains.
           <br/>
           Bb-Round seeds, intermediate size starch grains.
           <br/>

           (i) What significance does the conservation strategy hold?
           <br/>
           (ii) What is the difference between in situ and ex situ conservation?
           <br/>
           (iii) What are the few example of in situ and ex situ conservation?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Zoological parks involves outside conservation techniques where animal species are protected outside their natural habitats. This conservation gives longer lifetime and breeding activity to animals.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) In situ conservation is the conservation of species in their natural habitats. Whereas ex situ conservation is the conservation of species outside their natural habitats.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Example of in situ conservation are national parks, sanctuaries and biosphere reserves. Example of ex situ conservation are zoos, botanical gardens, cultural collections, etc.

           Question 23.
           <br/>
           What are the changes in the oogonia during the transition of a primary follicle to Graafian follicle?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The germinal epithelial cells divide repeatedly until many diploid oogonia are formed. The oogonia grow to form primary oocytes. Each primary oocyte then gets surrounded by a layer of granulosa cells and is called the primary follicle. These get surrounded by more layers of granulosa cells and called secondary follicles.
          </p>
          <p>
           The latter soon transforms into a tertiary follicle, which is characterised by a fluid-filled cavity called antrum. The primary oocyte within the tertiary follicle undergoes meiotic division to become a secondary oocyte and a first polar body (haploid).
          </p>
          <p>
           The tertiary follicle further changes into the mature follicle or Graafian follicle that ruptures to release the secondary oocyte (ovum) from the ovary by the process called ovulation.

           Question 24.
           <br/>
           Normally humans have 46 chromosomes arranged in 23 pairs, the pairs vary in size and shape.
           <br/>
           22 pairs are autosomes and one pair, i.e. number, 23 is the sex chromosome. Any variation in this pattern causes abnormalities.
           <br/>
           (i) Name the genetic disorder in a human female having 44 + XO karyotype.
           <br/>
           (ii) Explain the cause of such chromosomal disorder and mention the diagnostic features of this disorder.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) XO abnormality or monosomy of X-chromosome represents chromosomal disorder called Turnerâ€™s syndrome.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Non-disjunction is responsible for this chromosomal disorder. It is the phenomenon of failure of segregation of the members of homologous pairs of the chromosomes. Such disorder occurs due to the absence of one X-chromosome, i.e. 45 with XO (karyotype). The affected individual has underdeveloped feminine characters. Females are sterile and ovaries are rudimentary.

           (i) Which of these children belong to the parents? Explain with reason.
           <br/>
           (ii) If the record of mother is missing, will the child be identified with only the fatherâ€™s information?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) The two alleles (paternal and maternal) of a chromosome also contain different copy number of VNTR. It is clear from the banding patterns of DNA that parental DNA matches with child 1 and 3.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The information of only one parent is required for the identification of the child. So, if the record of mother is missing, the child can be easily identified with only the fatherâ€™s information.

           Choose any three microbes, from the following, which are suited for organic farming which is in great demand these days for various reasons. Mention one application of each one chosen.
           <br/>
           Mycorrhiza, Monascus, Anabaena, Rhizobium, Methanobacterium, Trichoderma.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Organic farming can be defined as an agricultural process that uses biological fertilisers and pest control acquired from animal or plant waste.
           <br/>
           The three microbes that can be chosen for organic farming are
           <br/>
           (i) Rhizobium : The nodules on the roots of leguminous plants are formed by the symbiotic association of Rhizobium bacteria. These bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen into organic forms, which is used by the plants as nutrient.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Mycorrhiza : Fungi form symbiotic association with plants called mycorrhiza, The fungal symbiont absorbs phosphorus from soil and passes it to the plant. Such plant shows resistance to root-borne pathogens, tolerance to salinity and drought and overall increase in plant growth and development.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Anabaena It is a cyanobacteria that is used as a biofertiliser. It fixes atmospheric nitrogen. [1]

           Question 27.
           <br/>
           A codon is a trinucleotide sequence of DNA or RNA that corresponds to a specific amino acid. The genetic code describes the
           <br/>
           relationship between the sequence of DNA bases in a gene and the corresponding protein sequence that it encodes.
           <br/>
           (i) (a) What is degeneracy?
           <br/>
           (b) â€˜Starting codon is universalâ€™. Justify.
           <br/>
           (ii) Which feature of genetic code allows bacteria to produce human insulin by recombinant DNA technology?
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Erwin Chargaff was one of those men, making two discoveries that led James Watson and Francis Crick to the double helix strucure of DNA. At first Chargaff noticed that DNA whether taken from a plant or animal-contained equal amounts of adenine and thymine and equal 1 amounts of cytosine and guanine. In addition Chargaff also found that amounts of guanine, cytosine, adenine and thymine vary by species are indication that DNA, not protein might be the genetic material for life.
           <br/>
           (i) Write the ratio which is constant in DNA of different species.
           <br/>
           (ii) If in a sea urchin DNA, 17% of the bases were shown to be cytosine. Then, what will be the percentage of the other three bases?
           <br/>
           (iii) In a DNA strand of length 340 Ã…. How many base pairs are present?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) (a) Degeneracy refers to the fact that one amino acid has more than one codons. This specify that the same amino acid differs only in the third base of the triplet, e.g. Both CAC and CAU code for the amino acid histidine.
           <br/>
           (b) Starting codon is universal means it is same universally for all organisms.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The bacteria is able to produce human insulin because genetic code is nearly universal in all organism. For example, the code AGG specifies amino acid arginine in bacteria, animals and plants.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (i) According to Chargaffâ€™s rule, in DNA there is always equality in quantity between the bases A
           <br/>
           and T and between the bases G and C (A is adenine, T is thyrnine, G is guanine and C is cytosine). So,
           <br/>
           A + T : C + G ratio is constant in DNA of different species.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Chargaffâ€™s rule states that purine and pyrimidine base pairs are present in equal amount in cfcDNA is A = T, G = C
           <br/>
           i.e. A + T = G + C, \(\frac{A+T}{G+C}\) = 1
           <br/>
           If cytosine = 17%, then G = 17%
           <br/>
           If A + G + C + T =100 and G =C,A =T
           <br/>
           then A + 17 + 17 + T =100, A + T + 34 = 100
           <br/>
           A + T = 100 â€“ 34, A + T = 66
           <br/>
           A = T =66/2 = 33%
           <br/>
           Hence, if cytosine is 17% then G = 17% and A and T will be 33% each.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Distance between consecutive bases is 3.4 A. 340 A means, it has 340/3.4 = 100 base pairs.
          </p>
          <p>

           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) The disorder that the person is suffering from is Downâ€™s syndrome.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Downâ€™s syndrome result from trisomy 21, which means each cell in the body has 3 copies of chromosomee 21 instead of 2 copies.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) The physical traits seen during birth are low
           <br/>
           muscle tone, a single deep crease across the palm of the hand, a slightly flattened facial profile, and an upward slant to the eyes.

           Question 32.
           <br/>
           Amniocentesis was first introduced as a mean of detecting the severity of Rhesus (Rh) isoimmunisation about 50 years ago. Invasive prenatal diagnosis and particularly amniocentesis was introduced into clinical practice as the mid-trimester diagnostic investigation of choice. Amniocentesis remains the most common invasive prenatal diagnostic procedure today. However, this technique is legally banned now.
           <br/>
           (i) This test is based on what principle?
           <br/>
           (ii) Explain why this procedure is banned now?
           <br/>
           (iii) Which diseases can be diagnosed by this process?

           As the corona virus disrupted lives and livelihoods in Utah, it appears that an increasing number of women sought abortions in the state, providers say. There were 3388 abortions done at the facilitive of the salt lake Tribune. And these numbers are likely incomplete, as private
          </p>
          <p>
           physicians also perform the procedures. The data shows the abortions done at which time of pregnancy.

           (i) Evaluate the efficacy of abortion done at the time of 7 to 8 weeks.
           <br/>
           (ii) How is MTP helpful in decreasing human population?
           <br/>
           (iii) Is MTP always surgical? Explain.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) During amniocentesis, an ultrasound transducer is used to show a babyâ€™s position in the uterus on a monitor. A sample of amniotic fluid which contains foetal cells and chemical produced by the baby is then withdrawn for testing.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Amniocentesis can lead to female foeticide as it
           <br/>
           detects the sex of the foetus, which decreases the gender ratio. So, it has a statutory ban to avoid female foeticide.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Amniocentesis can be used to detect Downâ€™s syndrome, i.e. chromosome abnormalities and genetic disorders like cystic fibrosis.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (i) MTP during 7-8 weeks at gestational period is safest as it can be done by medication or by pills, i.e. by taking drugs, So, it comes under the right time where most people go through this process.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) MTP is done to get rid of unwanted pregnancies due to casual unprotected intercourse, failure of the contraceptive during coitus. So, it is helpful in decreasing human population.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) MTP is not a contraceptive method. It can be carried out using abortion pills or by surgery. Thus, MTP is not always surgical.

           Question 33.
           <br/>
           Workout a typical Mendelian dihybrid cross and state the law that he derived from it.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Differentiate between incomplete dominance and codominance. Substantiate your answer with one example of each.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Dihybrid cross is a cross between two individuals with two observed traits that are controlled by two distinct gene.
          </p>
          <p>
           Law of independent assortment (Third law) is based on the inheritance of two genes, i.e. dihybrid cross which states that when two pairs of contrasting traits are combined in a hybrid, segregation of one
           <br/>
           pair of characters is independent of the other pair of characters.
          </p>
          <p>
           These factors randomly rearrange in the offspring producing both parental and new combination of characters.
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 12 Biology Set 9 with Solutions 13" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-154351" height="538" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-12-Biology-Set-9-with-Solutions-13.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-12-Biology-Set-9-with-Solutions-13.png 408w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-12-Biology-Set-9-with-Solutions-13-228x300.png 228w" width="408"/>
           <br/>
           It means inheritance of one character does not affect the inheritance of another character and both characters assort independently during gamete formation. The Punnett square can be used to understand the independent segregation of the two pairs of genes during meiosis.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
