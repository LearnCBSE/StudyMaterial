           Did the front wheel really wobble? What is your opinion? Give a reason for your answer.

           <br/>
           The front wheel wobbled occasionally, but it didn’t require any attention. The bicycle was in good condition and the author was pleased with it.

           in what condition did the author find the bicycle when he returned from the tool shed?

             Solution:
            </strong>
           </span>
           <br/>
           When the author returned from the tool shed his friend had taken out the front wheel of the bicycle. His friend was sitting on the ground with the wheel between his legs. He was playing with the wheel while the other part of the bicycle was lying on the gravel path beside him.

           </span>
           <br/>
           “Nothing is easier than taking off the gear-case but it is an impossible task to fix it back.” The author’s friend took out the gear-case easily, but he was having a nightmare in putting- it back to its place.

           Author’s friend tightened it to an extent that it didn’t move at all. He then loosened it until it was twice as loose as it was before.

           Describe ‘the fight’ between the man and the machine. Find the relevant sentences in the text and write them.

           <span style="color: #008000;">
            <strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
           </span>
           <br/>
           The bicycle was in good condition, but the author’s friend unnecessarily disturbed it. He first took out front-wheel and then the gear-case, his next victim was the chain. He really had a tough time in fixing these parts back into their place.
           <br/>
           Then he lost his temper and tried bullying the thing. The bicycle, I was glad to see, showed spirit and the subsequent proceedings degenerated into little else than a rough and tumble fight between them and the machine.One moment the bicycle would be on the gravel path and he on top of it; the next, the position would be reversed – he on the gravel path, the bicycle on him.
           <br/>
           Now he would be standing flushed with victory, the bicycle firmly fixed between his legs. But his triumph would be short-lived. By a sudden, quick movement it would free itself and turning upon him, hit him sharply over the head with one of its handles.

           The words in italics are modal auxiliaries. Modal auxiliaries are used with verbs to express notions such as possibility, permission, willingness, obligation, necessity etc. ‘Should,’ ‘must’ and ‘ought to’ generally express moral obligation, necessity and desirability.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Look at the following.

           <li>
            We should go on a holiday, (suggestion: It is a good idea for us to go on a holiday.)
           </li>
           <li>
            He is no too well these days. He must see a doctor before he becomes worse, (compulsion or necessity: It is absolutely essential or necessary for him to see a doctor.)
           </li>
           <li>
            You ought to listen to me. I am well over a decade older than you. (more emphatic than ‘should’: Since I am older than you, it is advisable that you listen to me.)
           </li>

           <br/>
           ‘en’ acts as a prefix (put at the beginning) or as a suffix (put at the end) to form new words.
           <br/>
           en + courage = encourage
           <br/>
           weak + en = weaken

           ‘en’ at the beginning or at the end of a word is not always a prefix or a suffix.
           <br/>
           It is then an integral part of the word ending, barren

           Author’s friend unscrewed the ball bearings without informing him. They started rolling on the ground and then they might have lost some of it there. Then the author kept them in his hat which was later blown away by the wind because of which they again lost five of those bearings.

           <br/>
           The author and his friend had planned to go for a ride on the bicycle, but the two couldn’t make it. His friend dismantled all the parts of the bicycle one-by-one. He first took out the front wheel and then the ball bearing from it. The chain was his next victim before he finally moved on to the gear-case. It took his friend the entire day to fix these parts back into their place and then he finally left for his home.

           </span>
           <br/>
           The author’s friend has taken out the ball bearings from the front wheel without any alarm. He then started fixing the front wheel only to realise latter that he had not put those bearings back into their place. He then moved to the chain.
           <br/>
           He first tightened it to an extent that it wasn’t moving and loosened twice its earlier state. The gear-case was the most complicated one. He took it easily, but a tough time fixing it back.

           <br/>
           We should treat things that belongs to others with utmostcare. We should treat them even more cautiously than we would have treated our things.
           <br/>
           There are many things around us that we consider dear to us. Similarly people are also emotional about their things and we must respect their feelings.
           <br/>
           Treating other’s thing’s callously will make them lose their trust on us and they might not lend their things to us again. We should take uttermost care while handling things belonging to others and must return them at once when our job is done.

           It is great to have friends in life. They add colours to our life. There are many things which we cannot share with our family, but can share with our friends easily.
           <br/>
           Our friends help us in our time of need and stand beside us during our thick and thin. We trust them and can rely on them in times of need. We must be helpful and understanding towards our friend and must always be available to render our help to them.
