           Question 2(i).
           <br/>
           What do you understand by atmosphere?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The atmosphere is composed of gases, water vapour and dust particles. The proportion of gases changes in the higher layers of the atmosphere in such a way that oxygen will be almost in negligible quantity at the height of 120 km. Similarly, carbon dioxide and water vapour are found only up to 90 km from the surface of the earth.

           Question 2(iii).
           <br/>
           Describe the composition of atmosphere.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The atmosphere is composed of gases, water vapour and dust particles. Nitrogen constitutes 78.8%, oxygen contributes 20.94% and argon contributes 0.93% in atmosphere. Other gases include carbon dioxide, helium, ozone, methane, hydrogen, krypton, xenon and neon, etc. Nitrogen and oxygen together constitute 99% of the atmosphere. Neon, krypton, xenon are scarce gases. The proportion of gases changes in the higher layers of the atmosphere in such a way that oxygen will be almost in negligible quantity at the height of 120 km. Similarly, carbon dioxide and water vapour are found only up to 90 km from the surface of the earth.

           Question 2(iv).
           <br/>
           Why is troposphere the most important of all the layers of the atmosphere?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The troposphere is the lowermost layer of the atmosphere. Its average height is 13 km and extends roughly to a height of 8 km near the poles and about 18 km at the equator. It is most important layer of the atmosphere because:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Thickness of the troposphere is greatest at the equator because heat is transported to great heights by strong convectional currents.
           </li>
           <li>
            This layer contains dust particles and water vapour.
           </li>
           <li>
            All changes in climate and weather take place in this layer.
           </li>
           <li>
            The temperature in this layer decreases at the rate of 1°C for every 165m of height.
           </li>
           <li>
            All biological activities take place in this layer.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           3. Answer the following questions in about 150 words.

           Carbon dioxide is meteorologically a very important gas as it is transparent to the incoming solar radiation but opaque to the outgoing terrestrial radiation. It absorbs a part of terrestrial radiation and reflects back some part of it towards the earth’s surface. It is largely responsible for the green house effect. Ozone is another important component of the atmosphere. It is found between 10 and 50 km above the earth’s surface and acts as a filter. It absorbs the ultra-violet rays radiating from the sun. It prevents them from reaching the surface of the earth.
          </p>
          <p>
           Water vapour is such a variable gas in the atmosphere, which decreases with altitude. In the warm and wet tropics, it may account for four per cent of the air by volume, while in the dry and cold areas of desert and polar regions, it may be less than one per cent of the air. Atmosphere has a sufficient capacity to keep small solid particles, which may originate from, different sources and include sea salts, fine soil, smoke-soot, ash, pollen, dust and disintegrated particles of meteors.

           Question 3(ii).
           <br/>
           Draw a suitable diagram for the structure of the atmosphere and label it and describe it.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The atmosphere consists of different layers with varying density and temperature. Density is highest near the surface of the earth and decreases with increasing altitude. The atmosphere is divided into five different layers depending upon the temperature condition.
           <br/>
           They are: troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere and exosphere.

           <br/>
           1. Troposphere: The troposphere is the lowermost layer of the atmosphere. Its average height is 13 km and extends roughly to a height of 8 km near the poles and about 18 km at the equator. Thickness of the troposphere is greatest at the equator because heat is transported to great heights by strong convectional currents. This layer contains dust particles and water vapour. All changes in climate and weather take place in this layer. The temperature in this layer decreases at the rate of 1°C for every 165m of height.
          </p>
          <p>
           2. Stratosphere: The stratosphere is found above the tropopause and extends up to a height of 50 km. One important feature of the stratosphere is that it contains the ozone layer. This layer absorbs ultra-violet radiation and shields life on the earth from intense, harmful form of energy.
          </p>
          <p>
           3.  Mesosphere: The mesosphere lies above the stratosphere, which extends up to a height of 80 km. In this layer, temperature starts decreasing with the increase in altitude and reaches up to minus 100°C at the height of 80 km.
          </p>
          <p>
           4. Ionosphere; The ionosphere is located between 80 and 400 km above the mesopause. It contains electrically charged particles known as ions, and hence, it is known as ionosphere. Radio waves transmitted from the earth are reflected back to the earth by this layer.
           <br/>
           Temperature here starts increasing with height.
          </p>
          <p>
           5. Exosphere: The uppermost layer of the atmosphere above the thermosphere is known as the exosphere. This is the highest layer but very little is known about it.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The main elements of atmosphere which are subject to change and which influence human life on earth are temperature, pressure, winds, humidity, clouds and precipitation. These elements act and react on each other. These elements determine the direction and speed of wind, amount of sunlight received, cloud formation and amount of rainfall. These in turn affect weather and climate. These factors behave differently in different places. All these elements are affected by a number of factors in turn. For example, temperature is affected by latitude and height; humidity is affected by distance from the sun and pressure is affected by height from sea level.

            The thickness of troposphere is greater at equation due to upward transportations of heat by conventional currents. This layer consists of dust particles and water vapours.
           </li>
           <li>
            The temperature decrease with height in this layer at a rate ldegree for every 165 m. this is known as Normal Lapse Rate.

          <ul>
           <li>
            The upper limit of troposphere separating it from stratosphere is called tropopause. It is very unstable at a thin layer and very thin layers of 1.5 km thickness.
           </li>
           <li>
            The temperature of tropopause is -80degree centigrade censius at equator and -40 degree centigrade at poles.

           <li>
            It is thicker at poles then at equator.
           </li>
           <li>
            The temperature is almost constant in its lower portion upto 20 km and their it gradually increases upto 50 km due to the presence of Ozone which absorbs UV rays.
           </li>
           <li>
            The temperature rises in the upper limits of the stratosphere as there are no clouds, no conventional currents, no dust particles and the air moves in the horizontal direction. The upper’ limit of stratosphere is called stratosphere which has concentration of Ozone gas.

           <li>
            Temperature decreases with height in this layer and false upto minus 100 degree centigrade at a height of 80-90 km. this is due to the clouds in high latitudes.
           </li>
           <li>
            The upper limit of Mesosphere is called as Mesopause.

           Class 11 Geography Chapter 8 HOTS Questions
          </h4>
          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           What would happen if there is no ozone in the atmosphere?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           It is the special variety of oxygen gas which is found in small quantity in atmosphere between 10 to 15 km above the earth surface. It acts as a filter and absorbs UV radiation from the sun and prevents them from reaching the earth surface. If ozone is not there, then UV rays will reach the surface of the earth. There will be extreme skin problems, instances of cancer and in all probabilities life would not have been possible on the earth.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           What is the role of dust particles in atmosphere?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The atmosphere has sufficient capacity to keep small solid particles which may originate from different sources and includes sea salts, fine soil, smoke soot, ash, polan, dust and disintegrated particles of meteors. Dust and solid particles act as hygroscopic nuclei around which water vapour condenses to produce clouds.
