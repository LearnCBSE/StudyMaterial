           Question 8.
           <br/>
           Describe the effect of the Great Depression on the world? Who were the worst affected by this depression? [1 × 3 = 3]
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Describe the achievements of any three early industrialists in British India. [1 × 3 = 3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Great Depression began around 1929 and lasted till the mid-1930s. During this period, there were catastrophic declines in production, employment, incomes and trade. Agricultural regions and communities were worst affected due to the great fall of agricultural prices.
           <br/>
           In the US, farmers could not sell their harvests, households were ruined and businesses collapsed. Many households in the US could not repay their loans due to fall in their income and were forced to give up their homes, cars and other consumer durables. Unemployment increased rapidly and people had to travel long distances in search of work.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Great Depression’s wider effects on society, politics and international relations and on peoples needs proved more enduring. The Depression immediately affected Indian trade. Indian exports and imports halved between 1928 and 1934. Peasants and farmers suffered more than urban dwellers. Though agricultural prices fell sharply, the colonial government refused to reduce revenue demands. Peasants producing for the world market were the worst hit. Across India, peasants indebtedness increased.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Having earned enough from trade, some businessmen had visions of developing industrial enterprises in India.
           <br/>
           In Bengal, Dwarkanath Tagore made his fortune in the China trade. He turned to industrial investment, setting up six joint stock companies in 1830s and 1840s.
           <br/>
           In Bombay, Parsis like Dinshaw Petit and Jamsetjee Nusserwanjee Tata who built huge industrial empires in India accumulated their initial wealth from exports to China and raw cotton shipments to England. Seth Hukumchand, a Marwari businessman, who set up the first Indian jute mill in Calcutta in 1971, also traded with China.

           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Describe any three steps taken by the French revolutionaries to create a sense of collective identity amongst the French people. [1 × 3 = 3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The first clear-cut expression of nationalism came with the French Revolution in 1789. In 1789, France was under the rule of an absolute monarch.
           <br/>
           When the revolutionaries came to power in France, they were determined to create a new sense of unity and nationhood. For this, they emphasized the concept of France being the father land (La Patrie) for all French people, who were from now on addressed as citizens (citoyen). They were given the tri-colour flag, the three colours representing liberty, equality and fraternity.
           <br/>
           French revolutionaries introduced various other measures such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The Estate General was elected by the body of active citizens and renamed the National Assembly.
           </li>
           <li>
            New hymns were composed, oaths taken and martyrs commemorated all in the name of the nation.
           </li>
           <li>
            A centralized administrative system was put in place and it formulated uniform laws for all citizens within its territory.
           </li>
           <li>
            Internal customs, duties and dues were abolished and a uniform system of weights and measures was adopted.
           </li>
           <li>
            Regional dialects were discouraged and French, as it was spoken and written in Paris, became the common language of the nation.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Evaluate the contribution of folklore, songs, popular prints etc., in shaping the nationalism during freedom struggle. [ 3 × 1 = 3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           History and fiction, folklore and songs, popular prints and symbols —all played an important role in creating a sense of collective belonging leading to the growth of nationalism.
           <br/>
           1. Image of Bharat Mata:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            With the growth of nationalism, the identity of the Indian nation came to be visually associated with the image of Bharat Mata.
            <br/>
            Moved by the Swadeshi Movement, Abainindranath Tagore painted the famous image of Bharat Mata. The identity of the Indian nation came to be visually associated with this image. She was portrayed as an ascetic figure-calm, composed, divine and spiritual.
           </li>
           <li>
            Later this image was painted by many other artists which acquired different forms. This image was circulated in popular prints and devotion to this mother figure was seen as a sign of nationalism.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           2. Reinterpretation of History:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The glorification of developments in ancient India in the fields of art and architecture, Science and Mathematics, religion and culture, law and philosophy, craft and trade had also helped in the growth of nationalism.
           </li>
           <li>
            These nationalist histories encouraged the readers to take pride in India’s great achievement in the past and struggle to change the miserable conditions (cultural and economic decline) of life under the British rule.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           3. Indian Folklore:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Idea of nationalism also developed through a movement to revive Indian folklore.
           </li>
           <li>
            Folk tales were sung by bards in the villages, to give a true picture of traditional culture, which had been damaged by outside forces.
           </li>
           <li>
            In Bengal, Rabindranath Tagore himself began collecting ballads, nursery rhymes and myths to revive folk culture.
           </li>
           <li>
            In Madras, Natesa Sastri published a four volume collection of Tamil folk tales, “The Folklore of Southern India”.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Question 11.
           <br/>
           Evaluate the impact of print technology on the poor people in India. [3 × 1 = 3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Impact of Print on the poor. Very cheap books were brought to markets in 19th century Madras towns and sold at crossroads, allowing poor people travelling to markets to buy them. Public libraries were set up from the early 20th century, expanding access to books. From the late 19th century, issues of caste discrimination began to be written about in many printed tracts and essays:
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) Jyotiba Phule, the Maratha pioneer of Tow caste’ protest movements, wrote about the injustices of the caste system in his Gulamgiri (1871). B.R. Ambedkar in
           <br/>
           Maharashtra and E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker in Madras, better known as Periyar, wrote powerfully on caste and their writings were read by people all over India.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) A mill worker at Kanpur called Kashibaba, wrote and published Chhote Aur Bade Ka Sawal in 1930 to show the links between caste and class exploitation. Bangalore Cotton Mill workers set up libraries to educate themselves following the example of Bombay workers.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 12.
           <br/>
           Why do the movement of goods and services form one place to another require fast and efficient means of transport? Explain with examples. [3 × 1 = 3]
           <br/>
           Answer:

           Transport plays an important role in the economy. Because of transport raw materials reach the factory and finished products reach to the consumer. The pace of development of a country depends upon the production of goods and services as well as their movement over space. Today the world has converted into a large village with the help of efficient and fast moving transport:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Good transport helps in quick carrying of raw materials from remote areas to the production centre and allows distribution of goods efficiently.
           </li>
           <li>
            Transport helps in the development of communication. Various means of communication help us in interacting with other people in all the parts of the world. It has brought the world closer.
           </li>
           <li>
            Transport like railways helps us in conducting various activities like business, sight seeing, pilgrimages, etc.
           </li>
           <li>
            Pipelines are used for transporting crude oil and natural gas to refineries and factories.
           </li>
           <li>
            Water provides the cheapest means of transport and is useful for international trade.
           </li>
           <li>
            Air transport provides the fastest, most comfortable mode of transport.
           </li>
           <li>
            Thus, it is clear that there are many advantages of transportation and communication. These means help in the development of the country. So they are rightly called the lifelines of a nation and its economy.

           Question 13.
           <br/>
           “Agriculture has been the backbone of the Indian economy”. Explain the statement by giving three reasons. [1 × 3 = 3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           India is primarily an agricultural country:
           <br/>
           (i) Two-third of its population is engaged in agricultural activities which provide livelihood. Agriculture is a primary activity and produces most of the food and foodgrains that we consume.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Agriculture produces raw materials for our various industries, e.g., cotton textile and sugar industry. Some agricultural products, like tea, coffee and spices, are exported and earn foreign exchange.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) The share of agriculture in providing employment and livelihood to the population continued to be as high as 63% in 2001.

           <br/>
           Analyse any three reasons that make democracy a better form of government. [1 × 3 = 3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           We feel that democracy is a better form of government than any other form of government because:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Democracy promotes equality among citizens.
           </li>
           <li>
            It enhances dignity of individual. It promotes dignity of women and strengthens the claims of the disadvantaged.
           </li>
           <li>
            It improves the quality of decision making. There is transparency in a democracy.
           </li>
           <li>
            It provides methods to resolve conflicts.
           </li>
           <li>
            Democracy allows room to correct mistakes. (any three)

           Question 15.
           <br/>
           Explain the prudential and moral reasons given in favour of power sharing. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Two reasons are given in favour of power sharing:
           <br/>
           The first set of reasons can be called ‘prudential’ which stresses that power sharing will bring out better outcomes. It helps to reduce the possibility of conflict between social groups. Since conflicts lead to violence and political instability, political order can be stabilised by power sharing. The Second set of reasons can be called ‘moral’, which emphasizes the very act of power sharing as valuable. Under this, we believe that the very spirit of democracy is power sharing. People have a right to be consulted on how to be governed and they have the right to participate in the system.

           Question 16.
           <br/>
           Explain any three consequences of the majoritarian policies adopted by the Sri Lankan government. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Sri Lanka emerged as an independent country in 1948. The democratically elected government adopted a series of majoritarian measures to establish Sinhala Supremacy. Consequences of these majoritarian policies:
           <br/>
           (i) The Sri Lankan Tamils felt that none of the major political parties led by the Buddhist Sinhala leaders were sensitive to their language and culture and the government policies denied them equal political rights which led to increased feeling of alienation among them.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The Sri Lankan Tamils felt that the constitution denied them equal rights in politics, in getting jobs and ignored their interests. The relation between the Tamil and Sinhala communities became extremely strained as a result.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) The Sri Lankan Tamils launched parties and struggles for the recognition of Tamil, for regional autonomy and equality of opportunity in every field.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) Therefore, the measures adopted by the government to establish Sinhala supremacy led to distrust between the two communities which turned the widespread conflict into a Civil War. As a result, thousands of people of both communities were killed and many families were forced to leave the country as refugees and lost their livelihoods.

           Question 17.
           <br/>
           Examine any three conditions which should be taken care of by multinational companies to set up their production units. [ 1 × 3 = 3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Conditions:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            MNCs set up offices and factories for production in regions where they can get cheap labour and other resources. Example, Countries like China, Bangladesh and India. They also provide with the advantage of cheap manufacturing locations.
           </li>
           <li>
            MNCs also need close-by markets for their manufacturing goods. Mexico and Eastern Europe are useful for their closeness to the markets in the US and Europe.
           </li>
           <li>
            Besides these, MNCs also require skilled engineers and IT personnel and a large number of English speaking people who are able to provide customer care services (India possibly tops in this area).
           </li>
           <li>
            All these factors help MNCs in saving costs of production by 50-60%.

           Question 18.
           <br/>
           Who are the vulnerable workers in the rural areas? Who need protection in urban areas? [3 × 1 = 3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Landless agricultural labourers, small and marginal farmers, share croppers and artisans (weavers, blacksmiths, carpenters, goldsmiths) need to be protected. They are part of unorganized sector. In urban areas workers in Small-Scale Industries, construction, trade and transport, ‘ street vendors, head load workers, garment makers, rag-pickers also need some form of protection from the Government. Small-scale industries also need Government’s support for procuring raw materials and marketing of their output.

           Question 19.
           <br/>
           “Plantation workers had their own understanding of Mahatma Gandhi’s ideas and the notion of ‘Swaraj.” Support the statement. [ 5 × 1 = 5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           “The plantation workers in Assam had their own understanding of Mahatma Gandhi and the notion of Swaraj” —
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            For plantation workers in Assam, freedom meant the right to move freely in and out of the confined space in which they were enclosed.
           </li>
           <li>
            Under the Inland Emigration Act of 1859 plantation workers were not permitted to leave the tea gardens without permission.
           </li>
           <li>
            Swaraj meant retaining a link with the village from which they had come.
           </li>
           <li>
            When they heard of the Non-cooperation Movement, thousands of workers defied the authorities, left the plantations and headed home.
           </li>
           <li>
            They believed that Gandhi Raj was coming and everyone would be given land in their own village.

           Question 20.
           <br/>
           ‘Energy saved is energy produced.’ Assess the statement. [2 + 3 = 5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Energy saved is energy produced. We cannot keep on producing non-renewable resources like petrol, diesel and electricity. So the need of the hour is the better utilization of existing resources. Energy depletion has become a global phenomenon at present time. The biggest problem that man has to face in near future is the energy crisis. The demand of energy is growing many-fold in the form of coal, oil, gas or electricity but the energy sources are becoming scarce and costlier. Nearly 97% of the world’s consumed energy is coming from fossil fuels, coal, petroleum and natural gas. Among the various strategies for meeting energy demand, the efficient use of energy and its conservation is the best solution. Following are some measures to conserve energy resources:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            We should try and use more and more public transport system instead of private vehicles.
           </li>
           <li>
            Electronic devices must be switched off when not in use.
           </li>
           <li>
            Reducing the consumption of non-renewable sources of energy.
           </li>
           <li>
            SolarpPower should be used to the maximum to generate electricity.
           </li>
           <li>
            Recycling of goods and commodities can also help to conserve energy.
           </li>

          <p>
           Question 21.
           <br/>
           Write the features of the ‘tankas’ built in the houses of Bikaner, Phalodi and Barmer. [1 + 4 = 5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           ‘Rooftop rainwater harvesting’ was commonly practiced to store drinking water, especially in semi-arid and arid regions like Bikaner, Phalodi and Barmer in Rajasthan.
           <br/>
           (i) In semi-arid and arid regions, all the houses had underground tankas or ‘tankas’ for storing drinking water built inside the house. They were the part of the well- developed rooftop rainwater harvesting system.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The tankas could be as large as a big room. One household in Phalodi had a tank that was 6.1 metres deep, 4.27 metres long and 2.44 metres wide.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) The tankas were built inside the main house or the courtyard.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) The tanks were connected to the sloping roofs of the houses through a pipe. The falling rain would travel down the pipes and get stored in the underground ‘tankas’. The first spell of rain would not be collected as it cleaned the roof and’ pipes. The rainwater from subsequent showers was collected.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) Many houses constructed underground rooms adjoining the tanka to beat the summer heat as it would keep the room cool.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 22.
           <br/>
           Describe any five efforts made to reform political parties in India. [5 × 1 = 5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Five efforts made to reform the Political Parties:
           <br/>
           (i) Law to regulate the internal affairs of political parties like maintaining a register of its members, to follow its own constitution, to have independent authority, to act as judge in case of party dispute, to hold open elections to the highest post.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) It should be mandatory for political parties to give one-third tickets to women candidates. Also there should be quota for women on the decision-making bodies of the party.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) There should be state funding of elections. The government should give money to parties to support their election expenses in kind (petrol, paper, telephone, etc.) or in cash on the basis of votes secured by the party in the previous election.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) The candidate should be educated, so that he can solve and understand people’s problems. His previous record should be cleared. He should be honest and there should be no criminal case against him.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) Citizens can reform politics if they take part directly and join political parties. People can put pressure on political parties through petitions, publicity in media, agitations etc.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 23.
           <br/>
           What was the Feminist Movement? Explain the political demands of the Feminist Movement in India. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Feminist Movements are radical women’s movements aiming at attaining equality for women in personal and family life and public affairs. These movements have organised and agitated to raise channels for enhancing the political and legal status of women and improving their educational and career opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
           Political demands of the feminist movement in India:
           <br/>
           The one way to ensure that women related problems get adequate attention in India is to have more women as elected representatives. To achieve this, it is legally binding to have a fair proportion of women in the elected bodies. Panchayati Raj in India has reserved one- third seats in Local Government bodies for women.
          </p>
          <p>
           In India the proportion of women in legislature has been very low. The percentage of elected women members in Lok Sabha is not even 10 per cent and in State Assemblies less than 5 per cent. India is behind several developing countries of Africa and Latin America. Women organizations had been demanding reservations of at least one-third seats in Lok Sabha and State Assemblies for women. And only recently, in March 2010, the women’s reservation bill was passed in the Rajya Sabha ensuring 33 per cent reservation to women in Parliament and State Legislative bodies.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 24.
           <br/>
           Explain the importance of the service sector. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Tertiary sector or service sector plays a very significant role and its importance is rising day by day:
           <br/>
           (i) Greater the development of primary sector and secondary sector more would be the demand for Services.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Tertiary sector has become the largest producer in India because various kinds of services such as hospitals, educational institutions, post and telegraph services, police stations, courts, village administrative offices, transport, banks, insurance companies etc. are required.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Even development of agriculture and industry leads to the development of services such as transport, trade and storage etc.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) With the rise in income, demand for more services is rising.
           <br/>
           For example, eating out in restaurants, tourism, malls and shopping complexes, schools, professional training.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) New services like Information Technology and outsourcing have become very important for modern day trade and industry.
           <br/>
           Unfortunately, the rapid growth of the service sector in India has not yet shown the expected corresponding increase in employment.
          </p>

           Question 25.
           <br/>
           Explain with reasons why state of Punjab with a very high per capita income has a low literacy rate. [5 × 1 = 5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Per capita income is not a useful criterion at all to measure the human development ranking – of a state. High per capita income is not the only attribute to a good quality life. Money cannot buy all the essential things required for a good life. This can be seen in the case of Punjab which has a very high per capita income but a low literacy rate. Having money in one’s pocket cannot buy all the goods and services that we need to live well. Money cannot ensure education and literacy. Another reason for low literacy rate in Punjab could be the lack of free and compulsory educational facilities. The government needs to open more schools and provide other facilities so that all children have a chance to study.
          </p>
          <p>
           Pollution-free atmosphere to ensure good health, protection from infectious diseases, lowering of mortality rate, promotion of literacy, etc. are essential for a good standard of living. In order to achieve these, joint efforts have to be made by all members of a community, be it rich or poor.
