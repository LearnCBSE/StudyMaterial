           Question 1.
           <br/>
           You start from Floor +2 and press -3 in the lift. Where will you reach? Write an expression for this movement.
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Here, the starting floor is +2 (Art center) and the number of button presses is -3.
           <br/>
           Therefore, Target floor = Starting floor + Movement
           <br/>
           = (+2) + (-3)
           <br/>
           = -1 (Toys Store).

          <p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Starting from different floors, find the movements required to reach Floor 5. For example, if I start at Floor +2, I must press -7 to reach Floor -5. The expression is (+2) + (-7) = -5. Find more such starting positions and the movements needed to reach Floor -5 and write the expressions.
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           (a) If I start at floor +1, 1 must press (-6) to reach floor -5.
           <br/>
           The expression is (1) + (-6) = -5.
           <br/>
           (b) If I start at floor +3, I must press (-8) to reach the floor (-5).
           <br/>
           The expression is (+3) + (-8) =-5.

           Question 3.
           <br/>
           If Floor A = -12, Floor D = -1, and Floor E = +1 in the building shown on the right as a line, find the numbers of Floors B, C, F, G, and H.
           <br/>
           <img alt="The Other Side of Zero Class 6 NCERT Solutions Ganita Prakash Maths Chapter 10 2" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-177782" height="660" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Other-Side-of-Zero-Class-6-NCERT-Solutions-Ganita-Prakash-Maths-Chapter-10-2.png" width="70"/>
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Let’s mark the numbers on the line.
           <br/>
           0, -1, -2, -3,…………, -12 and 1, 2, 3,……….., 12
           <br/>
           Now count each floor, and we get the number of floors.
           <br/>
           Here, B = -9, C = -6, F = +2, G = +6 and H = +11
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Mark the following floors of the building shown on the right.
           <br/>
           (a) -7
           <br/>
           (b) -4
           <br/>
           (c) +3
           <br/>
           (d) -10
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Here, one line is considered as one floor.
           <br/>
           The floor above floor 0 is marked with positive numbers and the floor below 0 is numbered with negative numbers.
           <br/>
           Now let’s mark the following numbers (-7, -4, +3, -10) in the building by circling the floor.

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Write down the above 3 marked negative numbers in the following boxes:
           <br/>
           <img alt="The Other Side of Zero Class 6 NCERT Solutions Ganita Prakash Maths Chapter 10 6" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-177786" height="30" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Other-Side-of-Zero-Class-6-NCERT-Solutions-Ganita-Prakash-Maths-Chapter-10-6.png" width="117"/>
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           -2, -5, and -8 are three negative numbers.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Is 2 &gt; -3? Why? Is -2 &lt; 3? Why? Solution: Is 2 &gt; -3?
           <br/>
           Yes, 2 is a positive number and -3 is a negative number. We know that positive numbers are always greater than negative numbers.
           <br/>
           Hence, 2 is greater than -3.
           <br/>
           Is -2 &lt; 3? Why?
           <br/>
           ∴ Yes, -2 is less than 3 because -2 is a negative number and 3 is a positive number.
           <br/>
           Hence -2 &lt; 3.
          </p>
          <p>
           4. What are
           <br/>
           (i) -5 + 0
           <br/>
           (ii) 7 + (-7)
           <br/>

           <br/>
           (v) 7 – (-7)
           <br/>
           (vi) -8 – (-10)?
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           (i) -5 + 0
           <br/>
           Adding 0 to any number does not change the value of the number.
           <br/>
           -5 + 0 = -5
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) 7 + (-7)
           <br/>
           Adding a number to its negative counterpart results in 0.
           <br/>
           7 + (-7) = 0
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) -10 + 20
           <br/>
           To add numbers with different signs, subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger absolute value and take the sign from the larger absolute value.
           <br/>
           -10 + 20 = 10
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) 10 – 20
           <br/>
           Subtracting a larger number from a smaller number gives a negative result.
           <br/>
           10 – 20 = -10
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) 7 – (-7)
           <br/>
           Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding the positive counterpart of the number.
           <br/>
           7 – (-7) = 7 + 7 = 14
          </p>
          <p>
           (vi) -8 – (-10)
           <br/>
           Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding the positive counterpart of the number.
           <br/>
           -8 – (-10) = -8 + 10 = 2

           (a) From the picture we see that we can remove three pairs.

           <br/>
           Since two negative tokens is remaining, the lift attendant is on the second floor below the ground floor.
           <br/>
           The corresponding addition statement is (+3) + (-5) = (-2)

           Since three positive tokens are remaining, the lift attendant is on the third floor above the ground floor.

           Solution:
           <br/>
           There are not enough tokens to take out 12 positives from 9 positives.
           <br/>
           So, we put an extra 3 zero pairs (1 pair = a positive and a negative).

           Now we can take out 12 positives.

           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Suppose you start with 0 rupees in your bank account, and then you have credits of ₹ 30, ₹ 40, and ₹ 50, and debits of ₹ 40, ₹ 50, and ₹ 60. What is your bank account balance now?
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Here, Credits = ₹ 30 + ₹ 40 + ₹ 50 = ₹ 120
           <br/>
           and Debits = ₹ 40 + ₹ 50 + ₹ 60 = ₹ 150

           ∴ Balance = Credits – Debits
           <br/>
           = ₹ 120 – ₹ 150
           <br/>
           = – ₹30

           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Here, Debits = ₹ 1 + ₹ 2 + ₹ 4 + ₹ 8 + ₹ 16 + ₹ 32 + ₹ 64 + ₹ 128 = ₹ 255
           <br/>
           ∴ Balance = Credits – Debits
           <br/>
           = ₹ 256 – ₹ 255
           <br/>
           = ₹ 1
           <br/>
           Therefore, your bank account balance is ₹ 1.

           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Why is it generally better to try and maintain a positive balance in your bank account? What are circumstances under which it may be worthwhile to temporarily have a negative balance?
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Having a positive balance in your bank account is generally better because:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Avoids Overdraft Fees: Many banks charge fees if your account balance goes negative.
           </li>
           <li>
            Provide Financial Security: A positive balance ensures you have funds available for unexpected expenses or emergencies.
           </li>
           <li>
            Builds Good Credit History: Maintaining a positive balance can help to improve your credit score, making it easier to get loans or credit cards in the future.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           There might be a few specific situations where temporarily having a negative balance could be considered:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Overdraft Protection: Some banks offer overdraft protection which can help avoid bounced checks or declared transactions.
           </li>
           <li>
            Planned Large Expenses: If you know you will have a large income soon and need to make essential purchases a temporary negative balance might be acceptable.
           </li>
          </ul>

           <br/>
           <img alt="The Other Side of Zero Class 6 NCERT Solutions Ganita Prakash Maths Chapter 10 43" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-177823" height="293" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Other-Side-of-Zero-Class-6-NCERT-Solutions-Ganita-Prakash-Maths-Chapter-10-43.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Other-Side-of-Zero-Class-6-NCERT-Solutions-Ganita-Prakash-Maths-Chapter-10-43.png 430w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Other-Side-of-Zero-Class-6-NCERT-Solutions-Ganita-Prakash-Maths-Chapter-10-43-300x204.png 300w" width="430"/>
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           You will need to estimate the height of each point A to G from the graph.
           <br/>
           Look at the vertical axis to determine the height value corresponding to each point.
           <br/>
           Heights:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            A = +1500 m
           </li>
           <li>
            B = -500 m
           </li>
           <li>
            C = +300 m
           </li>
           <li>
            D = -1200 m
           </li>
           <li>
            E = +1200 m
           </li>
           <li>
            F = -200 m
           </li>
           <li>
            G = +100 m
           </li>
          </ul>

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Which is the highest point in this geographical cross-section? Which is the lowest point?
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Identify the point on the graph that reaches the height point above sea level. Point A shows the highest point. Similarly find the point that is the lowest, considering points below sea level as well. Point D shows the lowest point.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Can you write the points A, B,……, and G in a sequence of decreasing order of heights? Can you write the points in a sequence of increasing order of heights?
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Based on the heights we determined in question 1, arrange the points from highest to lowest (decreasing order) A &gt; E &gt; C &gt; G &gt; F &gt; B &gt; D and then from lowest to highest (increasing order) D &lt; B &lt; F &lt; G &lt; C &lt; E &lt; A.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           What is the highest point above sea level on Earth? What is its height?
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           The highest point on Earth is Mount Everest at a height of 8848 m above sea level.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           What is the lowest point of sea level on land or the ocean floor? What is its height? (This height should be negative).
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           The lowest known point on the Earth is Marina Trench, in the Pacific Ocean, at a depth of 11034 m below sea level.

           <strong>
            Places:
           </strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Ladakh: This region is well-known for it’s extremely cold winters, with temperatures often dropping below 0°C.

           Do the calculations for the given grid and find the border sum.
           <br/>
           <img alt="The Other Side of Zero Class 6 NCERT Solutions Ganita Prakash Maths Chapter 10 47" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-177827" height="164" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Other-Side-of-Zero-Class-6-NCERT-Solutions-Ganita-Prakash-Maths-Chapter-10-47.png" width="173"/>
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Let’s analyze the given grid and find the border sum.
           <br/>
           Understanding the grid.
           <br/>
           The given grid is a 3 × 3 arrangement of numbers.
           <br/>
           The sum of numbers in each row and column should be the same.
           <br/>
           Calculating the Border Sum:
           <br/>
           Top row: 5 + (-3) + (-5) = -3
           <br/>
           Bottom row: (-8) + (-2) + 7 = -3
           <br/>
           Left column: 5 + 0 + (-8) = -3
           <br/>
           Right column: (-5) + (-5) + 7 = -3
           <br/>
           Therefore, the border sum of the given grid is -3.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Complete the grids to make the required border sum:
           <br/>
           <img alt="The Other Side of Zero Class 6 NCERT Solutions Ganita Prakash Maths Chapter 10 48" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-177828" height="173" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Other-Side-of-Zero-Class-6-NCERT-Solutions-Ganita-Prakash-Maths-Chapter-10-48.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Other-Side-of-Zero-Class-6-NCERT-Solutions-Ganita-Prakash-Maths-Chapter-10-48.png 499w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Other-Side-of-Zero-Class-6-NCERT-Solutions-Ganita-Prakash-Maths-Chapter-10-48-300x104.png 300w" width="499"/>
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Here is the completed grid:
           <br/>
           <img alt="The Other Side of Zero Class 6 NCERT Solutions Ganita Prakash Maths Chapter 10 49" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-177829" height="155" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 157px) 100vw, 157px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Other-Side-of-Zero-Class-6-NCERT-Solutions-Ganita-Prakash-Maths-Chapter-10-49.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Other-Side-of-Zero-Class-6-NCERT-Solutions-Ganita-Prakash-Maths-Chapter-10-49.png 157w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Other-Side-of-Zero-Class-6-NCERT-Solutions-Ganita-Prakash-Maths-Chapter-10-49-100x100.png 100w" width="157"/>
           <br/>
           The border sum is +4
           <br/>
           Explanation: We filled in the missing numbers to ensure the sum of each row and column is equal to the given border sum.
           <br/>
           e.g. in the first grid, to get a border sum of +4, the missing number in the top row should be 6 and 8. (Since -10 + 6 + 8 = +4).
           <br/>
           Attempt the remaining two grids by yourself.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           For the last grid above, find more than one way of filling the numbers to get the border sum -4.
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           There are multiple ways to fill the last grid with a border sum of -4, here are two examples:
           <br/>
           <img alt="The Other Side of Zero Class 6 NCERT Solutions Ganita Prakash Maths Chapter 10 50" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-177830" height="265" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Other-Side-of-Zero-Class-6-NCERT-Solutions-Ganita-Prakash-Maths-Chapter-10-50.png" width="154"/>
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Which other grids can be filled in multiple ways? What could be the reason?
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Grid with a larger size (more rows and columns) is likely to have multiple solutions. This is because there are more degrees of freedom to distribute numbers while maintaining the border sum.
          </p>

           <br/>
           Border sum: 2
           <br/>
           [Additional Notes: There might be more than two ways to fill the last grid. Creating larger grids with different order sums can lead to more complex and challenging puzzles.]

           Question 3.
           <br/>
           What could be so special about these grids? Is the magic in the numbers the way they are arranged or both? Can you make more such grids?
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Grids can be fascinating because of both the numbers and the way they are arranged. Here’s why:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Numbers: The numbers in a grid can follow specific patterns or sequences, such as magic squares where the sums of numbers in each row, column, and diagonal are the same.
           </li>
           <li>
            Arrangement: The way elements are arranged in a grid can create visual balance and harmony.
           </li>
          </ul>

           (c) -8 and -15
           <br/>
           (d) -30 and -23
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           (a) The integers between 0 and -7, in increasing order, are: -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1

           Question 3.
           <br/>
           There are two dice whose faces have these numbers: -1, 2, -3, 4, -5, 6. The smallest possible sum upon rolling these dice is -10 = (-5) + (-5) and the largest possible sum is 12 = (6) + (6). Some numbers between (-10) and (+12) are not possible to get by adding numbers on these two dice. Find those numbers.
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Let’s find the sums that are not possible when rolling these two dice.
           <br/>
           The faces of the dice are: -1, 2, -3, 4, -5, and 6.
           <br/>
           First, let’s list all possible sums:
           <br/>
           The sum of two negative numbers:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            (-1) + (-1) = -2
           </li>
           <li>
            (-1) + (-3) = -4
           </li>
           <li>
            (-1) + (-5) = -6
           </li>
           <li>
            (-3) + (-3) = -6
           </li>
           <li>
            (-3) + (-5) = -8
           </li>
           <li>
            (-5) + (-5) = -10
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           The sum of one negative and one positive number:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            (-1) + 2 = 1
           </li>
           <li>
            (-1) + 4 = 3
           </li>
           <li>
            (-1) + 6 = 5
           </li>
           <li>
            (-3) + 2 = -1
           </li>
           <li>
            (-3) + 4 = 1
           </li>
           <li>
            (-3) + 6 = 3
           </li>
           <li>
            (-5) + 2 = -3
           </li>
           <li>
            (-5) + 4 = -1
           </li>
           <li>
            (-5) + 6 = 1
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           The sum of two positive numbers:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            2 + 2 = 4
           </li>
           <li>
            2 + 4 = 6
           </li>
           <li>
            2 + 6 = 8
           </li>
           <li>
            4 + 4 = 8
           </li>
           <li>
            4 + 6 = 10
           </li>
           <li>
            6 + 6 = 12
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Now, let’s list all the possible sums in ascending order:
           <br/>
           -10, -8, -6, -4, -3, -2, -1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12
           <br/>
           The sum of numbers between -10 and 12 that are not the sum of possible to get are:
           <br/>
           -9, -7, -5, 0, 2, 7, 9, 11
          </p>

           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           (a) 8 – 13 = -5
           <br/>
           (b) -8 – (13) = -8 – 13 = -21
           <br/>
           (c) -13 – (-8) = -13 + 8 = -5
           <br/>
           (d) (-13) + (-8) = -13 – 8 = -21
           <br/>
           (e) 8 + (-13) = 8 – 13 = -5
           <br/>
           (f) -8 – (-13) = -8 + 13 = 5
           <br/>
           (g) (13) – 8 = 13 – 8 = 5

           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Find the years below.
           <br/>
           (a) From the present year, which year was it 150 years ago? _______________
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           150 years ago from the present year (2024):
           <br/>
           [2024 – 150 = 1874]
           <br/>
           So, 150 years ago, it was the year 1874.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) From the present year, which year was it 2200 years ago? _______________
           <br/>
           (Hint: Recall that there was no year 0.)
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           2200 years ago from the present year (2024):
           <br/>
           Since there was no year 0, we need to account for this in our calculation:
           <br/>
           [2024 – 2200 = -176].
           <br/>
           The year -176 corresponds to 177 BCE (Before the Common Era).
           <br/>
           So, 2200 years ago, it was the year 177 BCE.
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) What will be the year 320 years after 680 BCE? _______________
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           As BCE is before Christ, hence Let’s write 680 BCE = -680
           <br/>
           Hence, 320 years after 680 BCE = -680 + 320 = -360 = 360 BCE.

           (a) (-40), (-34), (-28), (-22), _____, ______, ______
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           (-40), (-34), (-28), (-22), _____, ______, ______
           <br/>
           Let’s subtract a last number of the sequence with the preceding number.
           <br/>
           ∵ (-22) – (-28) = -22 + 28 = 6
           <br/>
           (-28) – (-34) = -28 + 34 = 6
           <br/>
           -(34) – (-40) = -34 + 40 = 6
           <br/>
           Hence, this is a sequence where each term increases by 6.
           <br/>
           ∴ Next term = -22 + 6 = -16
           <br/>
           ∴ Following term = -16 + 6 = -10
           <br/>
           ∴ Final term = -10 + 6 = -4
           <br/>
           Hence, the sequence is (-40), (-34), (-28), (-22), (-16), (-10), (-4)
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) 3, 4, 2, 5, 1, 6, 0, 7, _____, ______, ______
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Let’s subtract the last number of the sequence with the preceding number.
           <br/>
           7 – 0 = 7
           <br/>
           0 – 6 = -6
           <br/>
           6 – 1 = 5
           <br/>
           1 – 5 = -4
           <br/>
           5 – 2 = 3
           <br/>
           2 – 4 = -2
           <br/>
           4 – 3 = 1
           <br/>
           Hence in this sequence, numbers are decreasing by 1 with alternate positive and negative integers.
           <br/>
           Hence the next number
           <br/>
           7 + (-8) = -1
           <br/>
           -1 + 9 = 8
           <br/>
           8 – 10 = -2
           <br/>
           -2 + 11 = 9
           <br/>
           and so on.
           <br/>
           Hence complete sequence is 3, 4, 2, 5, 1, 6, 0, 7, -1, 8, -2, 9,……
           <br/>
           Let us check
           <br/>
           -1 – 7 = -8
           <br/>
           8 + 1 = 9
           <br/>
           -2 – 8 = -10

          <p>
           (c) _____, ______, 12, 6, 1, (-3), (-6), _____, ______, ______
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           _____, ______, 12, 6, 1, (-3), (-6), _____, ______, ______
           <br/>
           Let’s subtract the last number of the sequence from the preceding number
           <br/>
           (-6) – (-3) = -6 + 3 = -3
           <br/>
           (-3) – (1) = -3 – 1 = -4
           <br/>
           1 – 6 = -5
           <br/>
           6 – 12 = -6
           <br/>
           Hence in this sequence, 1 negative integer is added to each number.
           <br/>
           Let’s take the first number of the sequence as x and the second number as y.
           <br/>
           2nd number = 12 – y = -7
           <br/>
           Hence y = 12 + 7 = 19
           <br/>
           1st number, let it be x
           <br/>
           2nd number 19 – x = -8
           <br/>
           ⇒ x = 19 + 8 = 27
           <br/>
           Now let’s find the 8th number, let it be a.
           <br/>
           Hence, a – (-6) = -2
           <br/>
           ⇒ a = -2 – 6 = -8
           <br/>
           Now let’s find the 9th number, let it be b.
           <br/>
           Hence b – (-8) = -1
           <br/>
           ⇒ b = -1 – 8 = -9
           <br/>
           Hence, the sequence is: 27, 19, 12, 6, 1, (-3), (-6), (-8), (-9), (-9)
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 7.
           <br/>
           Here are six integer cards: (+1), (+7), (+18), (-5), (-2), (-9).
           <br/>
           You can pick any of these and make an expression using addition(s) and subtraction(s).
           <br/>
           Here is an expression: (+18) + (+1) – (+7) – (-2) which gives a value (+14).
           <br/>
           Now, pick cards and make an expression such that its value is closer to (-30).
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Let’s try to create an expression that gets as close to (-30) as possible using the given cards: (+1, +7, +18, -5, -2, -9).
           <br/>
           One possible expression is: (-9) + (-5) + (-2) + (-18) + (+1)
           <br/>
           Let’s calculate the value step by step:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            1. (-9) + (-5) = -14
           </li>
           <li>
            2. -14 + (-2) = -16
           </li>
           <li>
            3. -16 + (-18) = -34
           </li>
           <li>
            4. -34 + (+1) = -33
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           Hence, the value of this expression is (-33), which is quite close to (-30).
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 8.
           <br/>
           The sum of two positive integers is always positive but a (positive integer) – (positive integer) can be positive or negative. What about
           <br/>
           (a) (Positive) – (Negative)
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           (Positive) – (Negative):
           <br/>
           Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding its positive counterpart. So, this will always be positive.
           <br/>
           For example, 5 – (-3) = 5 + 3 = 8.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) (Positive) + (Negative)
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           (Positive) + (Negative):
           <br/>
           This depends on the magnitudes of the numbers. If the positive number is larger, the result is positive; if the negative number is larger, the result is negative.
           <br/>
           For example,
           <br/>
           7 + (-4) = 3 (positive)
           <br/>
           4 + (-7) = -3 (negative)
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) (Negative) + (Negative)
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           (Negative) + (Negative):
           <br/>
           Adding two negative numbers always results in a negative number.
           <br/>
           For example, -2 + (-3) = -5.
          </p>
          <p>
           (d) (Negative) – (Negative)
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           (Negative) – (Negative):
           <br/>
           This is like adding the positive counterpart of the second number to the first negative number.
           <br/>
           If the first negative number is larger in magnitude, the result is negative.
           <br/>
           However, if the first negative number is smaller than the second negative number, then it is positive.
           <br/>
           For example,
           <br/>
           7 + (4) = 3 (positive)
           <br/>
           4 + (-7) = -3 (negative)
          </p>
          <p>
           (e) (Negative) – (Positive)
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           (Negative) – (Positive):
           <br/>
           This will always be negative because you’re subtracting a positive number from a negative number.
           <br/>
           For example, -4 – 2 = -6.
          </p>
          <p>
           (f) (Negative) + (Positive)
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           (Negative) + (Positive):
           <br/>
           Similar to (Positive) + (Negative), it depends on the magnitudes. If the positive number is larger, the result is positive; if the negative number is larger, the result is negative.
           <br/>
           For example,
           <br/>
           -3 + 5 = 2 (positive)
           <br/>
           -5 + 3 = -2 (negative)
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 9.
           <br/>

           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Let’s analyze the sequence of the string:
           <br/>
           3, -2, 3, -2, 3, -2
           <br/>
           <img alt="The Other Side of Zero Class 6 NCERT Solutions Ganita Prakash Maths Chapter 10 67" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-177847" height="58" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Other-Side-of-Zero-Class-6-NCERT-Solutions-Ganita-Prakash-Maths-Chapter-10-67.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Other-Side-of-Zero-Class-6-NCERT-Solutions-Ganita-Prakash-Maths-Chapter-10-67.png 317w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Other-Side-of-Zero-Class-6-NCERT-Solutions-Ganita-Prakash-Maths-Chapter-10-67-300x55.png 300w" width="317"/>
           <br/>
           Let’s take a set of 5 tokens as it is repeating, total is 3 – 2 = 1
           <br/>
           There are 100 tokens in the string.
           <br/>
           Hence total sets = \(\frac{100}{5}\) = 20 sets
           <br/>
           Total of 1 set = 1
           <br/>
           Hence, the value of the string = 1 × 20 = 20.

           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Negative Numbers: Less than zero.
           <br/>
           Yes, there can be numbers less than 0. These numbers are called negative numbers.
           <br/>
           [While it might seem impossible to have less than nothing, but negative numbers are used in many real-world situations.]

           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           If you press the ‘+’ button once then you will go up one floor and if you press the ‘-‘ button once then you will go down 1 floor.
           <br/>
           Hence to go four floors up you must press the ‘+’ button four times which we write as + + + + or +4.
           <br/>
           Now to go three floors down you must press the button three times which we write as – – – or -3.

            (Page No. 245)
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Here, Target floor = Starting floor + Movement
           <br/>
           ∴ The starting floor is +1 (Food Court) and the number of button presses is +2.
           <br/>
           Therefore, floor = starting floor + movement
           <br/>
           = (+1) + (+2)

           +4, -4, -3, 0, +2, -1
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           The additive inverse of +4 = -(+4) = -4.
           <br/>
           The additive inverse of -4 = -(-4) = +4.
           <br/>
           The additive inverse of -3 = -(-3) = +3.
           <br/>
           The additive inverse of zero (0) is zero itself.
           <br/>
           The additive inverse of +2 = -(+2) = -2.
           <br/>
           The additive inverse of -1 = -(-1) = +1.

           In the other exercises that you did above, did you notice that subtracting a negative number was the same as adding the corresponding positive number?
           <strong>
            (Page No. 252)
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Subtracting a number is the same as adding it’s opposite. So subtracting a positive number is like adding a negative number – you move to the left on the number line. Subtracting a negative number is like adding a positive number – you move to the right on the number line.
           <br/>
           For example: Subtract -2 – (-3)
           <br/>
           Start at -2 and move 3 units to the right.
           <br/>

           <br/>
           So, -2 – (-3) = +1

            (Page No. 252)
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           A number line is a way of representing numbers visually on a straight line. For instance, the number line has arrows at the end to represent this, idea of having no bounds. The symbol used to represent infinity is ∞.
