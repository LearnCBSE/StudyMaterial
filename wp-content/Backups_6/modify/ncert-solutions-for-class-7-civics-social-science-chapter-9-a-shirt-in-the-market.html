            1. Did Swapna get a fair price on the cotton?
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           No. Swapna did not get a fair price on the cotton. The local trader paid her low price.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            2. Why did the trader pay Swapna a low price?
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           The trader had lent Swapna money at the beginning of the cropping season on a condition that she would sell all her cotton to him. Thus, Swapna was in his grip. The trader took advantage of this situation and paid her a low price.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            3. Where do you think large farmers would sell their cotton? How is their situation different from Swapna?

            Answer:
           </strong>
           Large farmers would sell their cotton in the market. Their situation is different from Swapna. Unlike Swapna, they grew cotton on their own and therefore they are free to sell them anywhere they wish.

           <strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer: Merchants.
           </strong>
           They supply cloth on order to garment manufactures and exporters around the country. They purchase the yam and give instructions to the weavers about the kind of cloth that is to be made.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Weavers.
           </strong>
           They make cloth and bring this to the Erode cloth market for sale. They also make cloth on order from the merchant.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Exporters.
           </strong>
           They use the cloth to make shirts to export them to foreign buyers.

            Answer:
           </strong>
           Weavers are dependent on cloth merchants for raw materials and markets.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            6. If the weavers were to buy yam on their own and sell cloth, they would probably earn three times more. Do you think this is possible? How? Discuss.

           <strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           In such a situation the weavers would definitely earn more. They would buy yam at the lowest possible price and would sell cloth at the highest possible price. They would select the market of their choice for better price.

           Due to these reasons, small farmers easily come in the grip of the powerful local traders.

            2. How do weaver’s cooperatives reduce the dependence of weavers on the cloth merchants? [V. Imp.]
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           In a cooperative people with common interests come together and work for their mutual benefit. In a weaver’s cooperative, the weavers form a group and take up certain activities collectively. They get yam from the yam dealer and distribute it among the weavers. The cooperative also does marketing. In this way, the role of the merchants is reduced and weavers get a fair price on the cloth that they produce by dint of their hard labour.

            Answer:
           </strong>
           The Impex garment factory employs mostly women. The workers work on a temporary basis. They can be asked to leave at any time. Their wages are fixed according to their skills. The highest-paid among the workers are the tailors who get about Rs. 3,000 per month. Women are employed as helpers. They are engaged in thread cutting, buttoning, ironing, and packaging. They get the lowest wages.

            1. Who is involved in the putting-out system? How is this system advantageous and disadvantageous for the weavers? [V. Imp.]
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           The persons involved in the putting-out system are weavers and merchants.
           <br/>
           This system is advantageous for the weavers in two ways:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            They do not have to spend their money on the purchase of yam.
           </li>
           <li>
            They are also free from the tension of selling the finished cloth.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           This system is disadvantageous for the weavers in these ways:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            They have to depend on the merchants for raw materials as well as markets.
           </li>
           <li>
            Under this system, the merchants become very powerful. They give orders for what is to be made and they pay a very low price for making the cloth.
           </li>
           <li>
            The weavers have no way of knowing who they are making the cloth for or at what price it will be sold.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>

            2. How does market work move in favour of the rich and powerful? What are the ways to overcome them? (V. Imp.]
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           It is usually the rich and the powerful who earn the maximum profits in the market. These people have money and they own the factories, the large shops, large landholdings, etc. The poor have to depend on the rich and the powerful for various things. They have to depend on loans, for raw materials and marketing of their goods, and most often for employment.
          </p>
          <p>
           This dependence makes the poor miserable. They are easily exploited in the market. They get low wages in spite of their hard labour and the rich earn huge profits at the cost of the workers. There are ways to overcome these such as forming cooperatives of producers and ensuring that laws are following strictly.
