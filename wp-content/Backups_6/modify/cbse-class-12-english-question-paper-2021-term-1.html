           READING
          </p>
          <p>
           I. Read the passage given below:
           <br/>
           1. What’s the one thing that you associate with your college days? For me, it was consuming copious amounts of chai. A cup of tea was a panacea to all troubles and the companion to all joys. In this exclusive interview, we caught up with 65-year-old Deepak Garg, owner of Ganga Dhaba, a spot that every officerfrom National Academy of Administration has visited multiple times.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           2. Deepak begins, “My family has been here for almost 90 years. It was my grandfather who first started working here as the supplier to the hotel that existed then. “In 1964, when Deepak was all of eight, he lost his father and the responsibility of raising four children, fell on his mother.”
          </p>
          <p>
           3. “Our growing up years were a huge struggle. My mother used to teach home science at a local Balwadi School, and which was also where my siblings and I studied,” he says. In 1978, Deepak says that he started a food joint that he named Om Chinese Restaurant. “In those days, there was a huge liking for Chinese food and hence the name and the choice of cuisine,” he says.
          </p>
          <p>
           4. For almost 17 years, things continued and then Deepak got a Public Call Office (PCO) installed for the Officer Trainees. The business did so well that soon he had installed more than ten telephones, with separate cabins, to allow them some privacy while they made and received their calls.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           5. “The OTs who would talk on the PCO from here would always refer to the place as ‘Ganga Dhaba’. It wTas because this place is so close to the Ganga hostel inside the academy, that slowly the name changed and it became Ganga Dhaba. “Since it was the OTs that gave us our identity, we decided to change the name and call it Ganga Dhaba,” he says.
          </p>
          <p>
           6. There have been instances when Deepak and his family members have learnt dishes from the OTs. He says, “So many dishes on our menu today are because some officer came in and decided to teach us how to make them.”
          </p>
          <p>
           7. We have seen two generations of officers, served the parents, who now as the parents come back to drop their children at the academy and tell us to take care of them. What more can we ask for? While the money we make is not great, the respect and the love we have accumulated over the years is what keeps us going,” says Deepak, proudly. (400 words) Based on your understanding of the passage, answer any eight out of the ten questions by choosing the correct options:

           II. Read the passage given below:
           <br/>
           1. Air pollution is a major threat to human health. The United Nations Environment Programme has estimated that, globally, 1.1 billion people breathe in unhealthy air. The World Health Organisation (WTO) has estimated that urban air pollution is responsible for approximately 8,00,000 deaths and 4.6 million people lose their lives every year around the globe.
          </p>
          <p>
           2. Traffic and transportation problems, inadequate drainage facilities, lack of open spaces, carbon emission, and the accumulation of waste aggravate the problem. Air pollution is associated with increased risk of Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI), the principal cause of infant and child mortality in developing countries.
          </p>
          <p>
           3. Urbari air quality in most mega cities has been found to be critical and Kolkata is no exception to this. An analysis of ambient air quality in Kolkata was done by applying the Exceedance Factor (EF) method, where the presence of listed pollutants’ (RPM, SPM, NO

           4. Later, a health assessment was undertaken with a structured questionnaire at some nearby dispensaries which fall under areas with different ambient air pollution levels. Three dispensaries have been surveyed with 100 participants. It shows that respondents with respiratory diseases (85.1%) have outnumbered waterborne diseases (14.9%) and include Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) (60%), chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) (7.8%), Upper Track Respiratory Infection (UTRI) (1.2%). Influenza (12.7%), and Acid-Fast Bacillus (AFB) (3.4%).

           5. To live a healthy life and have better well-being, practising pollution-averting activities in one’s day-to-day activities is needed. These pollution-averting practices can only be possible when awareness among the masses is generated that the air, they breathe outdoors, is not found to be safe.
