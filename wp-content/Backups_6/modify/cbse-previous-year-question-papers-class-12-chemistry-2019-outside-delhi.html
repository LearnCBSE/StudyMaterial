           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Out of Chlorobenzene and Cyclohexyl chloride, which one is more reactive towards nucleophilic substitution reaction and why?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Cyclohexyl chloride is more reactive towards nucleophilic substitution reaction because the carbon bearing the chlorine atom is deficient in electron and seeks a nucleophile. In Chlorobenzene the carbon bearing the halogen is a part of an aromatic ring and is electron-rich due to the electron density in the ring.

           Question 5.
           <br/>
           What is the basic structural difference between starch and cellulose? [1]
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Write the products obtained after hydrolysis of DNA.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Starch consists of two components- amylose and amylopectin. Amylose is a long linear chain of α-D -(+)-glucose units joined by C

           -C
           <sub>
            6
           </sub>
           glycosidic linkage. On the other hand, cellulose is a straight-chain polysaccharide of β-D-glucose units joined by C

            4
           </sub>
           glycosidic linkage (β-link).
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Hydrolysis of DNA yields a pentose sugar (β-D-2deoxyribose), phosphoric acid and nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds called bases (Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine and Thymine).

           Question 7.
           <br/>
           Give reasons:
           <br/>
           (a) Cooking is faster in a pressure cooker than in cooking the pan.
           <br/>
           (b) Red Blood Cells (RBC) shrink when placed in saline water but swell in distilled water. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Boiling points increase in increasing the pressure in case of liquids. Water used for cooking attains a higher temperature than the usual boiling temperature inside the pressure cooker due to the existing high pressure inside the pressure cooker vessel. This leads to a faster flow of water inside the vegetables or grains etc. resulting in faster cooking of food in a pressure cooker than in the cooking pan.
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 Chemistry 2019 Outside Delhi Set I Q7" height="279" loading="lazy" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48526643086_3c53d60507_o.png" width="367"/>
           <br/>
           (b) Red blood cells shrink when placed in saline water because of exosmosis, i.e., water comes out from the cell to surrounding (more concentrated) to equate the concentration. Whereas, when placed in distilled water concentration within the cell becomes more than the surrounding, hence water comes inside and endosmosis takes place to equate the concentrations.

           <br/>
           (a) Find the order of reaction with respect to A and B.
           <br/>
           (b) Write the rate law and overall order of the reaction.
           <br/>
           (c) Calculate the rate constant (k). [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The reaction is A + 2B → C
           <br/>
           (a) It can be seen that when the concentration of A is doubled keeping B constant, then the rate increases by a factor of 4 (from 4.2 × 10
           <sup>
            -2
           </sup>
           to 1.68 × 10
           <sup>
            -1
           </sup>
           ). This indicates that the rate depends on the square of the concentration of the reactant A. Also when the concentration of reactant B is made four times, keeping the concentration of reactant A constant, the reaction rate also becomes 4 times (2.4 × 10
           <sup>
            -2
           </sup>
           to 6.0 × 10
           <sup>
            -3
           </sup>
           ). This indicates that the rate depends on the concentration of reactant B to the first power.
           <br/>
           (b) So, the rate equation will be:
           <br/>
           Rate = k[A]
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
           [B]
           <br/>
           Overall order of reaction will be 2 + 1 = 3.

           (c) Rate constant can be. calculated by putting the values given.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) In dust, the dispersed phase is solid particles and the dispersion medium is air (gas).
           <br/>
           (b) Physisorption occurs only because of physical attractive forces, like van der Waals forces between molecules of adsorbate and adsorbent, hence that can be reversed on the application of bigger forces but chemisorption occurs due to the chemical reaction between molecules of adsorbate and adsorbent, and hence can’t be reversed.

           So, for KCl
           <br/>
           n = (w

           <br/>
           Now as the solutions are isotonic at the same temperature:
           <br/>
           πRTKCl = πRTurea
           <br/>
           Hence, substituting the values for urea:
           <br/>
           2.55 × 10
           <sup>
            -4

           <br/>
           So, the experimentally determined molecular weight of urea is found to be as 117.6, so the degree of dissociation can be given as:
           <br/>
           Osmotic pressure (TT) = Experimentally determined

           Question 17.
           <br/>
           Write the name and principle of the method used for refining of (a) Zinc, (b) Germanium, (c) Titanium. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Distillation is used for refining zinc. As zinc is a low boiling metal, the impure metal is evaporated and the pure metal is obtained as a distillate.
           <br/>
           (b) Zone refining is used for refining Germanium. This method is based on the principle that the impurities are more soluble in the melt than in the solid-state of the metal.
           <br/>
           (c) Titanium is refined by van Arkel method. This method is used for the removal of oxygen and nitrogen present as an impurity. The crude metal is heated in an evacuated vessel with iodine to obtain metal iodide, which volatilizes being covalent. Later this metal iodide is decomposed through electrical heating to obtain the pure metal.

           Question 18.
           <br/>
           Give reasons for the following:
           <br/>
           (a) Transition metals form complex compounds.

           <br/>
           (c) Actinoids show a wide range of oxidation states. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Transition elements have partly filled d-orbitals due to which they have variable oxidation states which enables them to bind with a variety of ligands and hence form complex compounds.
           <br/>
           (b) Oxidation of Zn to Zn

           leads to a completely filled d10 configuration in Zn

           , making it more stable. Also, Mn/Mn
           <sup>
            2+
           </sup>
           conversion leads to a half-filled stable d

           and Mn/ Mn
           <sup>
            2+
           </sup>
           conversion has negative values.
           <br/>
           (c) Actinoids show a wide range of oxidation states due to their partially filled f-orbitals and they have comparable energies as well.

           Question 23.
           <br/>
           (a) Give reasons:
           <br/>
           (i) Benzoic acid is a stronger acid than acetic acid.
           <br/>
           (ii) Methanal is more reactive towards nucleophilic addition reaction than ethanal.
           <br/>
           (b) Give a simple chemical test to distinguish between propanal and propanone. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) (i) Benzoic acid is a stronger acid than acetic acid because the benzoate anion (the conjugate base of benzoic acid) formed after loss of H
           <sup>
            +
           </sup>
           is stabilized by resonance, whereas acetate ion (CH

           COO
           <sup>
            –
           </sup>
           ) has no such extra stability. Hence, Benzoic acid has more tendency of losing proton compared to acetic acid hence more acidic.
           <br/>

           <br/>
           (ii) Methanal is more reactive towards nucleophilic addition reaction than ethanal because in ethanal there is a methyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon (centre for nucleophile attack) and +1 effect of the methyl group decreases the nucleophilicity of carbonyl carbon by increasing the electron density at carbonyl carbon.

           <br/>
           (b) Propanal and propanone can be distinguished using Tollen’s reagent by silver mirror test. Propanal being an aldehyde reacts with Tollen’s reagent to give silver deposition whereas propanone being a ketone does not give the reaction.

           <br/>
           (c) A secondary battery can be recharged after use, bypassing current through it in the opposite direction so that it can be used again.
           <br/>
           Example: The most important secondary cell is lead storage cell. It consists of a lead anode and a grid of lead packed with lead dioxide as a cathode. A 38% solution of sulphuric acid is used as an electrolyte.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           (a) The cell can be represented as
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 Chemistry 2019 Outside Delhi Set I Q25.2" height="491" loading="lazy" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48526643991_b33ce533a4_o.png" width="355"/>
           <br/>
           (b) For strong electrolytes, the molar conductivity is increased only slightly on dilution. A strong electrolyte is completely dissociated in solution and thus, furnishes all ions for conductance. However, at higher concentrations, the dissociated ions are close to each other and thus, the interionic attractions are greater. These forces retard the motion of the ions and thus, conductivity is low. With a decrease in concentration (dilution), the ions move away from each other thereby feeling less attractive forces from the counterions. This results in an increase in molar conductivity with dilution. The molar conductivity approaches a maximum limiting value at infinite dilution designated as ∧m0.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the case of weak electrolytes as the solution of a weak electrolyte is diluted, its ionization is increased. This results in more number of ions in solution and thus, there is an increase in molar conductivity, also there is a large increase in the value of molar conductivity with dilution, especially near-infinite dilution. However, the conductance of a weak electrolyte never approaches a limiting value. Or in other words, it is not possible to find conductance at infinite dilution (zero concentration).
           <br/>
           So, limiting molar conductivity for weak electrolytes are obtained by using Kohlrausch law, from the limiting molar conductivities of individual ions (λ0).
          </p>
          <p>
           Kohlrausch law of independent migration of ions states that limiting molar conductivity of an electrolyte can be represented as the sum of the individual contributions of the anion and the cation of the electrolyte.

           Out of chlorobenzene and p-nitrochloro-benzene, which one is more reactive towards nucleophilic substitution reaction and why? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           p-Nitro chlorobenzene would be more reactive towards nucleophilic substitution reaction compared to chlorobenzene. In chlorobenzene the carbon bearing the halogen is a part of the aromatic ring and is electron-rich due to the electron density in the ring so, it does not attract the nucleophile. The -NO
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           substitution lessens the electron density on the benzene ring due to its electron-withdrawing nature, making the electron density on ringless compared to chlorobenzene, hence p-nitro chlorobenzene attracts nucleophiles better.

           Question 7.
           <br/>
           Give reasons:
           <br/>
           (a) A decrease in temperature is observed in mixing ethanol and acetone.
           <br/>
           (b) Potassium chloride solution freezes at a lower temperature than water. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Upon mixing molecules of ethanol and acetone have strong intermolecular attractions due to which heat is evolved from the reaction system and hence cooling of mixture is observed.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Potassium chloride solution is a solution of non-volatile solute KCl and water solution. We know that, at the freezing point of a substance, the solid phase (here ice) is in dynamic equilibrium with the liquid phase. A solution freezes when its vapour pressure equals the vapour pressure of the pure solid solvent. Now, according to Raoult’s law when a non-volatile solid is added to the solvent (in this case it is KCl), its vapour pressure decreases and now it would become equal to that of solid solvent at a lower temperature. Thus, the freezing point of the solvent decreases.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Chelate complex: Chelate complexes are coordination or complex compound consisting of a central metal atom attached to a large molecule, called a ligand, in a cyclic or ring structure. The ligands are bi or polydentate i.e., they can attach to metal atom through two or more than two binding sites. An example of a chelate ring occurs in the ethylenediamine-nickel complex.

           (a) Dispersed phase of milk is liquid and the dispersion medium of milk is liquid.
           <br/>
           (b) During the process of adsorption molecules of adsorbate and adsorbent come closer to form physical or chemical bonds hence getting stabilized, in this process heat is evolved leading the overall process to be exothermic.
           <br/>
           (c) Freundlich adsorption isotherm for gases at high pressure.
           <br/>
           It is an empirical relationship between the quantity of gas adsorbed by a unit mass of solid adsorbent and pressure at a particular temperature:

           Where x is the mass of the gas adsorbed on mass m of the adsorbent at pressure p, k and n are constants which depend on the nature of the adsorbent and the gas at a particular temperature.
           <br/>
           The relationship is generally represented in the form of a curve x/m is plotted against the pressure. This curve always approaches saturation towards high pressure, thus indicating that at adsorption through increases with increase in pressure till a limit and at high pressures, no further adsorption is observed.

           (a) Tin: It is refined through liquation. In this method, a low melting metal like tin is made to flow on a sloping surface, where the higher melting impurities are left behind and the lower melting metal is collected at the sloping end.
           <br/>
           (b) Copper: It is refined through electrolytic refining. Anode is made of impure copper and pure copper stripes are taken as the cathode. They are dipped in acidified solution of copper sulphate, as an electrolyte. The net result of electrolysis is the transfer of copper in pure form from the anode to the cathode and the impurities get deposited as anode mud.

           (c) Higher oxidation state of Mn with fluorine is +4 whereas with oxygen is +7. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Transition metals show variable oxidation states because their d-orbitals are incompletely filled and different arrangements of electrons are possible according to the chemical environment of metal ion hence, the ions can occupy variable oxidation states.

           (b) E° value for Zn/Zn
           <sup>
            2+
           </sup>
           is negative because the conversion of Zn to Zn
           <sup>
            2+
           </sup>
           gives it a completely filled d
           <sup>
            5
           </sup>
           configuration and extra stability gained by Zn
           <sup>
            2+
           </sup>
           . Whereas conversion of Cu to Cu
           <sup>
            2+
           </sup>
           does not give any extra stability, hence it has a positive E
           <sup>
            0
           </sup>
           value.
           <br/>
           (c) Mn has the highest oxidation state of +4 with fluorine but with oxygen, it is +7. This is due to the ability of oxygen to form multiple bonds with the metal ion, whereas fluorine being of small size and devoid of d-orbitals can’t form multiple bonds.

           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Out of Chlorobenzene and Cyclohexyl chloride, which one is more reactive towards nucleophilic substitution reaction and why? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Cyclohexyl chloride is more reactive towards nucleophilic substitution reaction because the carbon bearing the chlorine atom is deficient in electron and seeks a nucleophile. In Chlorobenzene the carbon bearing the halogen is a part of an aromatic ring and is electron-rich due to the electron density in the ring.

           Question 7.
           <br/>
           Give reasons:
           <br/>
           (a) An increase in temperature is observed on mixing chloroform and acetone.
           <br/>
           (b) Aquatic animals are more comfortable in cold water than in warm water. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) A mixture of chloroform and acetone forms a solution with a negative deviation from Raoult’s law. This is because chloroform molecule is able to form a hydrogen bond with acetone molecule as shown by the following figure:
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 Chemistry 2019 Outside Delhi Set III Q7" height="147" loading="lazy" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48526799472_3b4b4ea261_o.png" width="206"/>
           <br/>
           This decreases the escaping tendency of molecules for each component, and consequently, the vapour pressure decreases and the temperature of the solution is increased because of stability attained by the molecule by associating and releasing energy.
           <br/>
           (b) The solubility of gases in liquids increases on decreasing temperature, hence cold water has more dissolved oxygen because of which aquatic species find themselves more comfortable in cold water as compared to hot water.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Polydentate ligands: Ligands with several donor atoms are called polydentate ligands. These can bond with the metal ion in a complex with the different donor atoms present in them.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Butter is an example of ‘Gel’ type of colloid. Here the dispersed phase is liquid and dispersion medium is solid.
           <br/>
           (b) Physisorption occurs because of physical attractive forces, like Vander Waals forces between molecules of adsorbate and adsorbent, hence that can be reversed on the application of bigger forces. Hence, when the temperature is increased, the movement of adsorbed molecules increases, resulting in disturbed attractive forces, detachment of adsorbed molecules from the adsorbent surface hence physisorption decreases.
           <br/>
           (c) When the AgNO

           <br/>
           (c) Froth-floatation process [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Hydraulic washing: This method of concentration of ores is based on the differences in gravities of the ore and the gangue particles. It is a type of gravity separation. An upward stream of running water is used to wash the powdered ore. The lighter gangue particles are washed away and the heavier ores are left behind.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Chromatography: Chromatography is a physical method of separation of a mixture in which the components to be separated are distributed between two phases, stationary and mobile phase. The stationary phase may be a solid or a liquid supported on a solid or a gel. The mobile phase may be either a liquid or a gas.
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) Froth floatation process: Froth floatation is a physicochemical method of concentrating fine minerals. This process utilizes the difference in surface properties of valuable mineral and gangue (impurity) particles. For example, removal of gangue from sulphide ores.

            4+
           </sup>
           is a strong oxidising agent. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Transition element has high effective nuclear charge and a large number of valence electrons ((n-1) d electrons). So, as a result of the greater number of electrons participating, very strong metallic bonds are formed. As a result of the strong inter-atomic metallic bonding, the transition metals have high enthalpies of atomization.
           <br/>
           (b) Manganese has a lower melting point even though it has a higher number of impaired electrons for bonding. Melting point depends on the intermolecular or interatomic forces. Stronger the forces, higher the melting point. In Mn there is half-filled 3d subshell (3d
           <sup>
            5
           </sup>
           configuration) which makes it stable and hence, it does not make additional covalent bonds with nearby atoms hence, it has less melting point.
           <br/>
           (c) Ce
           <sup>
            4+
           </sup>
           is a strong oxidising agent because Ce
           <sup>
            4+
           </sup>
           oxidizes others and itself gets reduced to the common and preferred 3+ oxidation state of lanthanoid elements.
