           Question 1.
           <br/>
           ZZ/ZW type of sex determination is seen in
           <br/>
           (a) platypus
           <br/>
           (b) snails

           (d) peacock
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (d) In ZZ/ZW case, the female has heteromorphic (ZW) sex chromosomes and the male has homomorphic (ZZ) sex chromosomes. Thus, peacock shows ZZ/ZW sex determination type.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>

           (c) The correct option is (c) as both thalassemia and Down’s syndrome are correctly matched, while the rest can be corrected as
           <br/>
           In Klinefelter’s syndrome the affected males are sterile.
           <br/>
           In Turner’s syndrome the affected females are sterile as ovaries are rudimentary.

           <br/>
           (d) Assertion is false, but Reason is true
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 13.
           <br/>
           Assertion (A) : The female external genitalia includes mons pubis, labia majora and labia minora.
           <br/>
           Reason (R) : The glandular tissue of each breast contains single mammary lobe.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (c) Assertion is true, but Reason is false.
           <br/>
           The female external genitalia includes mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora, hymen and clitoris. The mammary glands are the paired structures (breasts) that contains glandular tissue and a variable amount of fat.
          </p>
          <p>
           The glandular tissue of each breast is divided into 15-20 mammary lobes containing clusters of cells called alveoli.

          <p>
           Question 14.
           <br/>
           Assertion (A) : The predominant site for control of gene expression in prokaryotes is transcription initiation.
           <br/>
           Reason (R) : The activity of RNA polymerase is regulated by accessory proteins, which affect recognition of start sites.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion.
          </p>
          <p>
           In prokaryotes, control of the rate of transcriptional initiation is the predominant site for control of gene expression. In a transcription unit, the activity of RNA polymerase at a given promoter is inturn regulated by the interaction with accessory proteins, which affect its ability to recognise start sites. These regulatory proteins can act both positively (activators) and negatively (repressors).

           Question 15.
           <br/>
           Assertion (A) : USA patent of brazzein is an example of biopiracy.
           <br/>
           Reason (R) : Brazzein, a protein obtained from West African plant, Pentadiplandra brazzeana and the gene encoding it has been patented by USA.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion.
          </p>
          <p>
           Brazzein is produced by Pentadiplandra brazzeana and is approximately 2000 times as sweet as sugar. It is used as a low calorie sweetener. Local people have been using the super sweet berries from their plants for centuries but protein, brazzein and the gene encoding it is patented in USA.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is proposed to transfer the brazzein gene into maize and express it in maize kernels from where it can be easily extracted. This is an example of biopiracy.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 16.
           <br/>
           Assertion (A) : Predation is an interspecific interaction with a feeding strategy.
           <br/>
           Reason (R) : Predators and their prey maintain fairly stable population through time and rarely one population become abundant or scarce.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion. Predation is an interspecific interaction with a feeding strategy. The number of predator usually depends upon the population of prey, but later is also controlled by predators.
          </p>
          <p>
           Thus, predator and prey maintain a fairly stable , population through time and rarely one population 1 becomes scarce or abundant.

           Question 17.
           <br/>
           ‘The advent of birth control pills resulted in increased risks of sexually transmitted diseases’. Assess the fact given above and present your opinion on it.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The advent of birth control pills encouraged people to have unprotected sexual intercourse. Other means of contraception particularly condoms, are not used.
          </p>
          <p>
           Thus, STDs are being more readily transmitted during sexual activities due to lack of any physical mechanical barrier.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           The drugs that the authorities usually look for are cocaine and morphine.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is necessary for the authorities to conduct such tests as sports-persons often take drugs to increase their performance. Which would be unfair for those sports persons who do not consume drugs.

           Question 20.
           <br/>
           In a court case seeking to determine the actual father of a baby7, five samples were collected for DNA fingerprinting tests.
           <br/>
           The samples were collected from the mother, the baby and three potential fathers namely Man-1, Man 2 and Man 3.
           <br/>
           These samples are subjected to rigourous analysis to compare their genetic profiles and identify any similarities or differences for resolving the paternity dispute. The results of the tests are depicted in the diagram below.
           <br/>
           <img alt="v" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-153924" height="250" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-12-Biology-Set-6-with-Solutions-5.png" width="197"/>
           <br/>
           (i) Based on the result of DNA fingerprinting who is the father of child? Justify.
           <br/>
           (ii) Is there any limitatiom on DNA fingerprinting. Support your answer with a suitable explanation.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Based on the above results it can be inferred that two bands of the child matches with the mother. Whereas among the three men only man 3 has two bands that matches with the child and these bands do not match with the mother.
          </p>
          <p>
           Therefore it is possible that man 3 has provided the child with both of the bands.
          </p>
          <p>
           Hence, it can be concluded that man 3 is the father of the child.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) While DNA fingerprinting is highly accurate technique, it does not provide a 100% guarantee. As the accuracy results dependends on many factor such as quality of smaple, and the selection of appropriate genetic markers for analysis. Thus errors possibility is there.

           <br/>
           (ii) Give one example each of pyramid of number and pyramid of biomass in such cases.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Primary productivity is the amount of biomass or organic matter produce per unit area over a time period by plants. It has two aspects, i.e. Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Net Primary Productivity (NPP).
           <br/>
           (i) What is the difference between net and gross primary productivity?
           <br/>
           (ii) Why primary productivity varies in different types of ecosystems? Explain.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) The ecological pyramid shown represents the inverted pyramid of biomass wherein small standing crop of phytoplanktons supports large standing crop of zooplanktons.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Pyramid of number is inverted in tree ecosystem and that of biomass is inverted in pond ecosystem.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (i) Net primary productivity refers to the biomass/organic matter available for the consumption to heterotrophs, left after some respiratory losses. Whereas, gross primary productivity is the rate of production of biomass/organic matter by producers during photosynthesis.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The primary productivity varies in different types of ecosystem because
           <br/>
           (a) It depends upon plant species (producers) of a given ecosystem and their photosynthetic capacity.
           <br/>
           (b) It is dependent on various environmental factors, availability of nutrients.

           Question 22.
           <br/>
           The figure given below shows a biogas plant.
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 12 Biology Set 6 with Solutions 7" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-153926" height="221" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-12-Biology-Set-6-with-Solutions-7.png" width="283"/>
           <br/>
           (i) Identify the part labelled as A in the diagram above and describe biogas.
           <br/>
           (ii) Which group of microbes are observed in a biogas plant?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) A represents digester in the biogas plant, which is used to anaerobically decompose the biodegradable materials, used to produce biogas. Biogas is mainly methane rich gas fuel produced by anaerobic breakdown of waste biomass by methanogenic bacteria.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The group of microbes observed in a biogas plants are called methanogens. These bacteria grows anaerobically on cellulosic material and produces large amounts of methane along with carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas.

           Question 23.
           <br/>
           Explain the functions of seminal vesicle, acrosome and scrotum of the human male reproductive system.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Seminal Vesicle During spermatogenesis, it secretes an alkaline fluid rich in fructose and prostaglandins. High level of fructose are known to provide energy to the sperms.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Acrosome It is the cap-like structure in the head region. The acrosome contains hydrolytic enzyme, which help sperm to enter into the cytoplasm of the ovum and thus helps in fertilisation.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Scrotum It is the bag like structure made up of skin that holds and helps to protect testicles.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 24.
           <br/>
           The DNA molecule that can carry a foreign DNA segment and replicate inside the host cell is called as a vector.
          </p>
          <p>
           Plasmids and bacteriophages are used as cloning vectors. This is because plasmids and bacteriophages have the ability to replicate within the bacterial cell independent of chromosomal DNA.
          </p>
          <p>
           Bacteriophages have very high copy numbers of their genome within the bacterial cells. But in case of plasmids, some may have only one or two copies per cell whereas others may have 15-100 copies per cell.
           <br/>
           (i) Name the selectable markers in the cloning vector pBR322. Mention the role they play.
           <br/>
           (ii) Why is the coding sequence of an enzyme P-galactosidase a preferred selectable marker in comparison to the ones named above?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Selectable markers in cloning vector pBR322 are ampiciilin and tetracycline antibiotic resistance gene. They help in the selection of transformants and eliminating the non-transformants.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The selection of recombinants due to inactivation of antibiotics is a difficult process and requires simultaneous plating on two plates having different antibiotics. Thus, enzyme β-galactosidase is preferred as a selectable marker because it allows differentiation of non-recombinants from recombinants easily by insertional inactivation technique.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 25.
           <br/>
           Study the graph given below which shows the growth curve of animal population.
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 12 Biology Set 6 with Solutions 8" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-153927" height="192" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-12-Biology-Set-6-with-Solutions-8.png" width="255"/>
           <br/>
           (i) The curve ‘B’ is described by the following equation
           <br/>
           \(\)\frac{d N}{d t}\(\) = rN{\(\)\frac{K-N}{K}\(\)}
           <br/>
           What does ‘K’ stand for in this equation and mention its significance?
           <br/>
           (ii) Which one of the two curves is considered a more realistic one for most of the animal populations? Also which curve would depict the population of a species of deer if there are no predators in the habitat? Explain.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) ‘K’ stands for carrying capacity. It signifies the limit of habitat, which means that the limited resources in a given habitat support growth upto a certain level beyond which no further growth can take place.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The curve ‘B’ is considered more realistic one for most of the animal populations. It is so because in the curve ‘S’, the sources of food and space are limited and it supports the growth curve of animal populations.
          </p>
          <p>
           The curve ‘B’ would depict the population of a species of deer if there are no predators in the habitat. In the absence of predators, prey population will increase. Thus, the competition will increase due to the limited food and shelter resources within the prey population.

           Question 26.
           <br/>
           Expand VNTR and describe its role in DNA fingerprinting. List any two applications of DNA fingerprinting technique.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           VNTRs The expanded form of VNTR is Variable Number of Tandem Repeats. These are short nucleotide repeats in DNA. These are highly specific for individuals.
          </p>
          <p>
           Role of VNTR in Fingerprinting VNTRs are used as probe markers in the identification of DNA of different individuals because no two individuals can have the same VNTRs (except in case of monozygotic twins).
          </p>
          <p>
           DNA fingerprinting is a technique that shows the genetic makeup of living things. Two applications of DNA fingerprinting are as follows
           <br/>
           (a) DNA fingerprinting can identify the real genetic ’ mother, father and offspring.
           <br/>
           (b) DNA fingerprinting is very useful in the detection of crime and legal pursuits.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) The average duration of human pregnancy is called as gestation period. It is approximately 270 days in humans.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The term given to the process of delivery of foetus is called parturition.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Parturition is the birth of the fully formed foetus on completion of pregnancy or gestation. It helps in expulsion of the foetus.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (i) Testis is the primary sex organ in males. The process of gamete formation in males is called spermatogenesis.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Spermatogonium. It is diploid (2n) cell which divides to produce haploid gamete or sperm (n).
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Sertoli cells. These cells provide nourishment to developing spermatocytes.

           Question 28.
           <br/>
           State the views of Oparin and Haldane on evolution. How does SL Miller’s experiment support their views?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The theory of biogenesis was proposed by Oparin and Haldane. It states that life could have come from pre-existing non-living organic molecules (e.g. RNA, protein, etc.) and the formation of life forms was preceded by chemical evolution, i.e. formation of diverse organic molecules from inorganic constituents.
          </p>
          <p>
           In 1953, Urey and Miller conducted an experiment to prove this theory. They created the conditions of primitive earth, i.e. high temperature, volcanic storms, reducing atmosphere containing CH
           <sub>
            4
           </sub>
           , NH
           <sub>
            3
           </sub>
           , etc, at laboratory scale. They then stimulated electric discharge in a closed flask containing CH
           <sub>
            4
           </sub>
           , H
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           , NH
           <sub>
            3
           </sub>
           and water vapour at 800°C. They also observed the formation of amino acids.
          </p>
          <p>
           In similar experiments, they observed the formation of sugars, nitrogen bases, pigments and fats. These small organic molecules are the building blocks for proteins and other components. Hence, this experiment supported that life has come from pre-existing non-living organic molecules.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) A is denaturation process and B are primers. C is Tag DNA polymerase, a thermostable enzyme, which remains active during the high temperature and induces denaturation of DNA.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Role of Heat in PCR (in vitro), the DNA strands are separated by heating at 95°C for two minutes. Heating causes the breakage of H-bonds between bases of two strands leading to its unwinding.
          </p>
          <p>
           Role of Primers Primers are short lengths of DNA of about 20 bp long that are required to start DNA polymerisation in PCR. The primers hybridise to their complementary sequence on the DNA strands at 40°-50°C temperature and help in DNA polymerisation.
          </p>
          <p>
           Role of Thermus aquaticus An enzyme called Taq polymerase is isolated from Thermus aquaticus. Since, this bacteria thrives in temperature as high as 95°C, this enzyme can also tolerate high temperature without undergoing denaturation. Therefore, this enzyme is used in PCR instead of normal DNA polymerase.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           The restriction enzymes cuts the DNA molecule by cleavage in two ways.
          </p>
          <p>
           Blunt end Restriction enzymes like Alu I, Hae III, Hind II, Sma I, etc. makes cuts across both the strands of DNA in the centre of recognised sequence. Thus, DNA segments produced are with blunt ends.
          </p>
          <p>
           Sticky end In this type of cleavage, the cuts are made in two strands of DNA at two different sites, few nucleotides away from each other. As a result of this two strands with protruding ends or overhanging stretches are produced. These strands are called stick ends. e.g. EcoRI, Pst I, BamHI, etc.

           Question 32.
           <br/>
           Intrauterine devices are most widely accepted methods of contraception. These are used by females and are inserted by doctor or nurses in the uterus through vagina. However, these devices are not recommended for those who eventually intend to conceive.
           <br/>
           (i) Explain how does Cu-T prevent conception.
           <br/>
           (ii) Name the IUDs which makes uterus unsuitable for implantation.
           <br/>
           (iii) Copper ions releasing IUDs are more efficient than non-medicated methods. Why?
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>

           <br/>
           (i) Explain the menstrual phase in a human female. State the level of ovarian and pituitary hormones during this phase.
           <br/>
           (ii) Why is follicular phase in the menstrual cycle also referred as proliferative phase? Explain.
           <br/>
           (iii) Explain the events that occur in a Graafian follicle at the time of ovulation and thereafter.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Cu-T is placed in the uterus and proves to be an effective method of contraception in human females. It prevents implantation of the zygote on the uterine wall. It is a long lasting method of contraception.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Hormone releasing IUDs are progesterone and LNG-20 which make uterus unsuitable for implantation.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Cu ion releasing lUDs are more efficient methods of contraception because
           <br/>
           (a) they suppress the sperm motility and capacity of fertilising ovum.
           <br/>
           (b) it is safest long term, least expensive, reversible contraceptives available.
           <br/>
           The hormone releasing lUDs on the other hand, makes uterus unsuitable for implantation and the cervix hostile for sperms.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (i) The reproductive organs of female undergo rhythmic changes called as the menstrual cycle. The average cycle in human females is about 28-29 days. The start of menstrual cycle at puberty is known as menarche. It involves four phases menstrual follicular, ovulatory and luteal.
          </p>
          <p>
           The menstrual phase forms the first phase of menstrual cycle which occurs for 3-5 days.
          </p>
          <p>
           The endometrium linning of the uterus breaks down during this phase. The unfertilised ovum, as well as the blood vesels are discharged from the vagina. It leads to the abdominal cramps due to the contraction of the uterus and abdominal muscles. Oestrogen and progesterone levels are low during day 1 of menstrual phase which stimulates the pituitary gland to secrete FSH of follicular maturation.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The follicular phase is also known as the proliferation phase as in this phase the production and growth of the follicles take place. During this phase, one of the follicles matures to become Graafian follicle and uterus endometrium lining undergoes regeneration through proliferation.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) During mid cycle there is rapid secretion of LH hormones which causes LH surge leading to the rupture of Graafian follicle thus, releasing the ovum by the process of ovulation.
          </p>
          <p>
           During ovulation only the egg comes out of the follicles while remaining ruptured follicle remains on the surfaec of the ovary within two weeks the follicle get transformed into a structure known as corpus luteum. It releases progesterone and small amount of oestrogen, both of which maintain the thickening of the walls, of the uterus for implantation. If , pregnancy takes place the high levels of 1 progesterone are maintained and if pregnancy does not occur then the corpus luteum withers away on day 22. There is a drop in progesterone level and wall of the uterus lining falls off leading to menstruation.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 33.
           <br/>
           Sketch a schematic diagram of lac operon in switched on position. How is the operon switched off? Explain.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Describe the process of transcription in bacterium.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Lac operon consists of
           <br/>
           (i) an operator, which controls all structural genes as a unit.
           <br/>
           (ii) a regulatory gene (i gene).
           <br/>
           (iii) three structural genes (z, y, a), which code for enzymes.
           <br/>
           (iv) a promoter, where RNA polymerase binds for transcription.
          </p>
          <p>
           The regulatory gene codes for a repressor protein that has high affinity for the operator region and which prevents RNA polymerase from transcribing the structural genes, i.e. the lac operon is switched off or inactive.
           <br/>

           <br/>
           Its function in the presence and the absence of inducer is as follows
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) When inducer (lactose) is present, Lactose acts as an inducer and binds to the repressor. Thus, forming an inactive repressor. The repressor fails to bind the operon. The operon is switched off in this situation.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) When inducer (lactose) is present, Lactose acts as an inducer and binds to the repressor. Thus,
           <br/>
           forming an inactive repressor.
          </p>
          <p>
           The repressor fails to bind the operator region. The RNA polymerase binds to the operator and transcribe lac mRNA.
          </p>
          <p>
           Lac mRNA is known to be polycistronic which produces ail three enzymes, i.e. (β-galactosidase, permease and transacetyiase required for the hydrolysis of lactose. Operon is switched on in this situation.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Initiation process of transcription in bacteria RNA polymerase becomes associated transiently to an initiation factor sigma (a) and binds to specific sequence on DNA called promoter to initiate transcription.
          </p>
          <p>
           A single DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyses the transcription of all the three types of RNA.

           Elongation process of transcription in bacteria
           <br/>
           RNA polymerase facilitates opening of the DNA helix after binding to promoter. It uses ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrate and polymerises the nucleotides in a template dependent fashion following complementarity.
          </p>
          <p>
           The process continues till RNA polymerase reaches the terminator region on the DNA strand.
