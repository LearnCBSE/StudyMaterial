            Q.1. Give two examples of different types of global exchanges which took place before the 17th century, choosing one example from Asia, and one from America.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Ans.
            <br/>
           </strong>
           <strong>
            (a) Asia:
           </strong>
           The silk routes are a good example of vibrant pre-modern trade before the 17th century. The historians have identified several silk routes, overland and by sea, linking Asia with Europe and northern Africa. .These routes were used for trades in Chinese pottery, textiles and spices from India and Southeast Asia. In return, precious metals – gold and silver – came from Europe to Asia.’ Secondly, Christian missionaries and later Muslim preachers travelled through these routes. It may be mentioned here that in ancient times, Buddhism too spread in several directions through intersecting points on the silk routes.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            (b) Americas:
           </strong>
           After the discovery of the Americas by Christopher Columbus, many of our common foods such as potatoes, soya, groundnuts, maize, tomatoes, chilies came from America’s original inhabitants i.e., the American Indians. From the sixteenth century, America’s vast lands, abundant crops and minerals transformed trade and lives everywhere. Precious metals like silver from mines in Peru and Mexico enhanced Europe’s wealth and financed its trade with Asia. Legends spread in seventeenth-century Europe about South America’s fabled wealth. Many expeditions set off in search of El Dorado, the fabled city of gold. Thus there were global exchanges before the seventeenth century.

           <strong>
            (ii) Impact on meat:
           </strong>
           Till the 1870s, meat from America was shipped to Europe in the form of live animals which were then slaughtered in Europe. But live animals took up a lot of ship space. But the invention of refrigerated ships made it possible to transport meat from one region to another. Now animals were slaughtered in America, Australia or New Zealand, and then transported to Europe as frozen meat. The invention of the refrigerated ship had the following advantages :
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            This reduced shipping costs and lowered meat prices in Europe.
           </li>
           <li>
            The poor in Europe could now consume a more varied diet.
           </li>
           <li>
            To the earlier, monotony of bread and potatoes many, not all, could add meat, butter and eggs.
           </li>
           <li>
            Better living conditions promoted social peace within the country, and support for imperialism abroad.
           </li>
          </ol>

            Q.5. What is meant by the Bretton Woods Agreement ?
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Ans.
            <br/>
           </strong>
           The main aim of the post-war international economic system was to preserve economic stability and full employment in the industrial world. The United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference held in July 1944 at Bretton Woods in New Hampshire in the USA agreed upon its framework.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            The Bretton Woods Conference established the following institutions :
           </strong>
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            <strong>
             International Monetary Fund:
            </strong>
            Its aim was to deal with external surpluses and deficits of its member nations.
           </li>
           <li>
            The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development or World Bank was set “Up to finance post-war reconstruction.
           </li>
           <li>
            The above institutions are known as The Bretton Woods institutions or Bretton Woods twins. The post-war international economic system is also often described as the Bretton Woods system. It was based on fixed exchange rates. National currencies were pegged to the dollar at a fixed exchange rate. The dollar itself was anchored to gold at a fixed price of $ 35 per ounce of gold.
           </li>
           <li>
            The decision-making in these institutions is controlled by the western industrial powers. The US has an effective right of veto over key IMF and World Bank decisions.
           </li>
          </ol>
