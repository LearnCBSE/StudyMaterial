           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Answer the following questions:
           <br/>
           (A) Menstruation is a monthly cycle in females. However, if fertilisation happens, menstruation will not occur. What changes can be expected if fertilisation does not occur? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The uterus prepares itself during every ovulation cycle in anticipation of a possible pregnancy. The lining of the uterus thickens so that it can give support to the developing embryo. When fertilisation does not occur, this lining disintegrates because it is no longer required. The fragments of the lining are shed along with blood and the discarded egg through the vagina. The discharge of discarded tissue is called menstruation.
          </p>
          <p>
           (B) Sexually Transmitted Diseases are a real threat to the mankind. However, there are ways to prevent STDs. Can you give one example of STD caused by bacteria and virus each and suggest ways to prevent it. (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Gonorrhoea is caused by bacteria and AIDS is caused by virus. These diseases can be prevented by responsible sexual behaviour such as use of condom during sexual intercourse, etc.

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Answer the following questions:
           <br/>
           (A) Why did Mendel choose garden pea plant for his experiments? Write two reasons. (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Mendel choose garden pea plant for his experiments because:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Pea plant has several contrasting characters like height, flower colour, seed colour and shape.
           </li>
           <li>
            Normally allows self pollination but cross pollination can also be done.
           </li>
           <li>
            It has short life span and also is easy to cultivate.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (B) List two contrasting visible characters of garden pea used by Mendel for his experiment. (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Contrasting characters of garden pea plants:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Colour of seeds:
           </li>

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           It can be seen wire P has a length L and area of cross section A while the wire Q has a length of L and a area of cross section A/2. We know that resistance is directly proportional to length and inversely proportional to area of cross section. Hence the resistance of Q will be higher since its area of cross section is less than that of the wire P.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           We know that resistance of metals is directly proportional to the temperature. Higher temperature leads to higher resistance and vice-versa. In the graph T
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           has a higher resistance than T
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           hence the temperature T
           <sub>

           is higher than T
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           .

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 10 Science Term 2 Set 2 with Solutions 4" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-132823" height="156" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-Science-Term-2-Set-2-with-Solutions-4.png" width="288"/>

           (B) Chlorine has an atomic number of 17. By what process/es will it be able to attain a noble gas configuration. Illustrate with the help of diagram. (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Electronic configuration of chlorine is 2, 8, 7. it requires only one more electron to attain a noble gas configuration. It can do so either by sharing one electron with other chlorine atom and thus forming a chlorine molecule. Or it can accept an electron from an electropositive element such as group 1 or 2 metals and form an ionic compound. In either way, it will attain a noble gas configuration.
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 10 Science Term 2 Set 2 with Solutions 5" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-132822" height="295" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-Science-Term-2-Set-2-with-Solutions-5.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-Science-Term-2-Set-2-with-Solutions-5.png 366w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-Science-Term-2-Set-2-with-Solutions-5-300x242.png 300w" width="366"/>

          <p>
           Caution:
           <br/>
           Students may only identify with one method and miss the other interaction. Chlorine can adopt both mechanisms such as covalent interaction with another similar atom and ionic interaction with a metal. Be careful to mention both methods.

           As can be seen from the table above, we can assess the elements as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            P is a metal as it easily loose an electron to gain stability.
           </li>
           <li>
            Q is a non-metal as it can gain three electrons to gain stability.
           </li>
           <li>
            R is a non-metal as it can gain one electron to gain stability.
           </li>
           <li>
            S is an inert gas as it has a completely filled shell and is stable.
           </li>
           <li>
            Thus, amongst the above elements, R is the most reactive non-metal as it requires only one electron to attain stability and Q is also a reactive non-metal that requires only three more electrons to gain stability.

           A nonmetal is a chemical element that usually gains electrons when reacting with a metal, and which forms an acid if combined with oxygen and hydrogen. Nonmetals display more variety in colour and state than do metals. About half are coloured or colourless gases whereas nearly all metals are silvery-grey solids. They tend to be poor conductors of heat and electricity with no structural uses, in contrast to most metals.

           Mendeleev left some gaps in his Periodic Table. Instead of looking upon these gaps as defects, Mendeleev boldly predicted the existence of some elements that had not been discovered at that time. Mendeleev named them by prefixing a Sanskrit numeral, Eka (one) to the name of preceding element in the same group.

           Monoatomic ions are formed by the addition or removal of electrons from an atom’s valence shell. The inner shells of an atom are filled with electrons that are tightly bound to the positively charged atomic nucleus and so do not participate in this kind of chemical interaction, but the valence shell can be very reactive depending on the atom and its electronic configuration. The process of gaining or losing electrons from a neutral atom or molecule is called ionization.

           The electronic configuration of the element is 2, 8, 5. A look at the configuration enables us to understand the valency of the element to be 3 as it can lose three electrons to gain stability.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           When green plants are eaten by primary consumers, a great amount of energy is lost as heat to the environment Some amount goes into digestion and in doing work and the rest goes towards growth and reproduction. Only 10 percent of the energy received by them is converted into their body mass which is available for the organisms of the next trophic levels. The longer the food chain, the less is the energy available to the final members of the food chain and that energy will be insufficient for their survival. So, the food chain is generally limited to 3-4 trophic levels only.

           In a current carrying circular loop direction of magnetic field lines can be found by the Right- Hand Thumb Rule. Thumb is showing direction of current and fingers show the direction of magnetic field lines. This means magnetic field lines are around the conducting wire. But circular shape of the conductor means that field lines at different points of the loop appear to be making many rings around the periphery of the loop. It can be visualized like many small rings looping around the periphery of a big ring. Effect of number of turns in a coiL we know that if number of turns in a coil is increased, then magnetic field will also increase. Due to this, strength of magnetic field increases with increased number of turns in a coil. Magnetic field lines through a circular loop are given below:

           Answer:

           (A) An atom has electronic configuration 2, 8, 5. (2)
           <br/>
           (i) Calculate the number of protons.
           <br/>
           (ii) Is it a metal or non metal? Give reason.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) The electronic configuration represents the arrangement of electrons in different shells. Thus, it also represents the total number of electrons in an element. Atomic number of an element is represented by number of electrons as well as number of protons.
           <br/>
           Thus, number of protons is equal to 2 + 8 + 5 = 15 in the given atom.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) As we can see the electronic configuration of atom is 2, 8, 5, the element requires only 3 more electrons to attain stability. The element can gain these 3 electrons to attain stability. Thus, the element behaves as a non metal as it gains electrons for attaining

           The nonmetals are located on the upper right side of the periodic table. Nonmetals are separated from metals by a line that cuts diagonally through the region of the periodic table. The nonmetals are in a minority on the periodic table, mostly located on the right-hand side of the periodic table. The exception is hydrogen, which behaves as a nonmetal at room temperature and pressure and is found on the upper left corner of the periodic table.
          </p>
          <p>
           Under conditions of high pressure, hydrogen is predicted to behave as an alkali metal. Nonmetals have high ionization energies and electro negativities. They are generally poor conductors of heat and electricity. Solid nonmetals are generally brittle, with little or no metallic luster. Most nonmetals have the ability to gain electrons easily. Nonmetals display a wide range of chemical properties and reactivities.

           Question 12.
           <br/>
           In order to attain a noble configuration, elements tend to either lose or gain electrons. This type of interaction leads to an ionic bond formation. On the other hand, few elements adopt to an entirely different mode of interaction where they share the electrons to attain a noble gas configuration.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (A) Carbon adopts a mutual sharing of electrons, which is, covalent bond formation to attain a noble gas configuration.
          </p>
          <p>
           (B) For ionic bond formation, the two pathways can be adopted.
           <br/>
           1. If carbon loses 4 electrons, it becomes C4+. But it would require a large amount of energy to remove four electrons leaving behind a carbon cation with six protons in its nucleus holding on to just two electrons.
          </p>
          <p>
           2. If carbon accepts 4 electrons, it becomes C
           <sup>
            4-
           </sup>
           . But it would be difficult for the nucleus with six protons to hold on to ten electrons, that is, four extra electrons.
           <br/>
           Thus, it cannot form ionic interaction.
           <br/>
           Due to these reasons, carbon adopts covalent interaction. It is feasible for carbon to share the electrons rather than transfer or accept the electrons.
          </p>
          <p>
           (C) Carbon compounds are generally formed by covalent bond formation. Thus, it does not dissociate into ions. Thus, it is not possible to conduct electricity and thus are poor conductors of electricity.

           (A) A covalent bond is a chemical bond that involves the sharing of electron pairs between atoms.

           <br/>
           A woman has only daughters. Analyze the situation genetically and provide a suitable explanation. (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A woman has only daughters. We know that the sex of the child is determined at the time of fertilization when male and female gametes fuse to form zygote. The male individual contains one X chromosome and one Y chromosome (XY) and the female individual contains two X chromosomes (XX).
          </p>
          <p>
           If a sperm carrying X chromosome fertilizes an egg then the offspring will be a female child. This is because the offspring will have XX combination of sex chromosomes.
          </p>
          <p>
           If a sperm carrying Y chromosome fertilizes an egg then the offspring will be a male child. This is because the offspring will have XY combination of sex chromosomes.
          </p>
          <p>
           Thus the sex of the child is determined by the type of sperm that fuses with the ovum at the time of fertilization.

           Resistance is the property of a conductor to resist the flow of charges through it. The current which flows through a resistor is inversely proportional to its resistance, If the resistance is doubled the current gets halved. The resistance of the material depends on various factors. The resistivity of an alloy is generally higher than that of its constituent metals.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           (A) The materials with a resistivity 10
           <sup>
            -7
           </sup>
           has a lower resistivity and hence higher conductivity and hence it is a poorer insulator. That makes the other material with resistivity 10
           <sup>
            -4
           </sup>
           a better insulator owing to its higher resistivity.
          </p>
          <p>
           (B) When a wire is stretched its length increases but its area decreases in proportion to the increase in length. This is due to the fact that the mass of the material remains constant which owing to its constant density means that the volume of the wire has to remain constant. Hence by stretching the wire to 4 times its length the area decreases by 4 times. Which means R = \(\frac{\rho l}{A}=\frac{\rho(4 l)}{A}=16 \frac{\rho l}{A}\). Hence the new resistance is 16 times higher than th original. So the new resistance is 160 Ohms.
          </p>
          <p>
           (C) Mathematically any variable can be made to move around in an equation based on the availability of values of the other related variables. So mathematically it is correct. But when looked at it from the Physics point of view we see that the equation means that resistivity is proportional to resistance, area and length but that is not the case since in any material the resistivity is a constant quantity and does not depend on these three factors. Hence his friend is correct to point out that the equation is not.

          <p>
           (A) Which diseases could be caused due to indulgence in unprotected sexual intercourse? (1)
           <br/>
           (B) What do you think is the difference between miscarriage and abortion? (1)
           <br/>
           (C) Prenatal sex determination has been prohibited by law. What could be the reason for this?
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Reproduction is linked to stability of population of a species. Do you think this statement is correct? Justify the statement. (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (A) The disease include bacterial infections such as gonorrhoea and syphilis, and viral infections such as warts and HIV-AIDS.
          </p>
          <p>
           (B) Miscarriage is the unintended loss of pregnancy. Abortion is the planned and intended termination of pregnancy.
          </p>
          <p>
           (C) To lessen the indiscrimination of female foeticide, the Indian government has passed legislation prohibiting prenatal sex determination. As a result, in some parts of our culture, the child sex ratio has been dropping at an alarming rate. As a result, the child sex ratio must be maintained. Preventing crimes connected to a lower female ratio in society, such as female and child trafficking, sexual assault and abuse against women and children, increased maternal mortality owing to forced abortions, and early marriages, can be avoided in the long run by outlawing prenatal sex determination.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Every species has a threat to its life due to various factors like predators, natural calamities, diseases, etc. The natural cycle of life and death also removes a section of the population. Reproduction is a way to replenish the lost section of population. Thus, it can be said that reproduction is linked to the stability of population of a species.
