            • Organic Chemistry
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Organic chemistry is the branch of chemistry that deals with the study of hydrocarbons and their derivatives.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            The Shapes of Carbon Compounds:
           </strong>
           <br/>
           In organic or carbon compounds, s and p orbitals are involved in hybridisation. This leads to y three types of hybridisation which are sp

           <strong>
            Functional Group:
           </strong>
           The functional group are atom or group of atoms joined in a specific manner which determines the chemical properties of the organic compound. The examples are hydroxyl group (—OH), aldehyde group (—CHO) and carboxylic acid group (—COOH) etc.
           <br/>

            • Homologous Series
           </strong>
           <br/>
           A homologous series may be defined as a family of organic compounds having the same functional group, similar chemical properties and the successive members differ from each other in molecular formula by —CH2 units.
           <br/>
           The members of a homologous series can be represented by same general molecular formula.
           <br/>

            • Nomenclature of Organic Compounds
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Common name (Common system):
           </strong>
           Before the IUPAC system of nomenclature, organic compounds were named after the sources of origin, for example, urea was so named because it was obtained from the urine of mammals. Formic acid was so named since it was extracted from red ants called formica.

           </strong>
           <br/>
           According to IUPAC system, the name of an organic compound contains three parts: (i) word root, (ii) suffix, (iii) prefix.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (i) Word root:
           </strong>
           Word root represents the number of carbon atoms present in the principal chain, which is the longest possible chain of carbon atoms.

           <strong>
            (ii) Suffix:
           </strong>
           Suffix are of two types, primary suffix, secondary suffix.
           <br/>
           (a) Primary Suffix: It indicates the type of bond in the carbon atoms.
           <br/>

           <br/>
           (b) Secondary Suffix: Secondary suffix is used to represent the functional group.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (iii) Prefix:
           </strong>
           Prefix is a part of IUPAC name which appears before the word root. Prefix
           <br/>
           are of two types:
           <br/>
           (a) Primary prefix: For example, primary prefix cyclo is used to differentiate cyclic compounds.
           <br/>

           <br/>
           (b) Secondary prefix: Some functional groups are considered as substituents and denoted by secondary prefixes.
           <br/>
           For example:

            Naming of Compounds Containing Functional Groups:
           </strong>
           The longest chain of carbon atoms containing the functional group is numbered in such a manner that the functional group is attached at the carbon atoms possessing lowest possible number in the chain.
           <br/>
           In case of polyfunctional compounds, one of the functional group is selected as principal functional group and the compound is named on that basis. The choice of principal functional group is made on the basis of order of preference.
           <br/>
           The order of decreasing priority for the functional group is

            • Isomerism
           </strong>
           <br/>
           When there are two or more compounds possessing the same molecular formula but different structural formula and different physical and chemical properties, the phenomenon is called isomerism. Such compounds are called isomers.
           <br/>
           It is of two types:
           <br/>
           (1) Structural Isomerism
           <br/>
           (2) Stereoisomerism
           <br/>
           (1) Structural Isomerism: Structural isomerism is shown by compounds having the same molecular formula but different structural formulae differing in the arrangement of atoms.
           <br/>
           (2) Stereoisomerism: When isomerism is caused by the different arrangements of atoms or groups in space, the phenomenon is called stereoisomerism. The steroeoisomers have same structural formula but differ in arrangement of atoms in space. Stereoisomerism is of two types:
           <br/>
           (i) Geometrical or Cis-Trans Isomerism
           <br/>
           (ii) Optical Isomerism
           <br/>

           Fission of a covalent bond: A covalent bond can undergo Fission in two ways:
           <br/>
           (i) By Homolytic Fission or Homolysis
           <br/>
           (ii) By Heterolytic Fission or Heterolysis
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Homolytic Fission:
           </strong>
           In this process each of the atoms acquires one of the bonding electrons.

           <br/>
           The products of heterolytic fission are ions.

           <strong>
            Reaction Intermediates:
           </strong>
           Heterolytic and homolytic bond fission results in the formation of short-lived fragments called reaction intermediates. Among the important reaction intermediates are carbonium ions, carbanions, carbon free radicals and carbenes. Carbonium Ions (carbocations): Organic ions which contain a positively charged carbon atom are called carbonium ions or carbocations. They are formed by heterolytic bond fission.

            Electron Displacement Effects in Covalent Bonds:
           </strong>
           Electronic displacements in covalent bonds occurs due to the presence of an atom or group of different electronegativity or under the influence of some outside attaching group.
           <br/>
           These lead to a number of effects which are as follows:
           <br/>
           (i) Inductive effect (ii) Elecromeric effect
           <br/>
           (iii) Resonance or Mesomeric effect (iv) Hyperconjugation effect.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Inductive Effect:
           </strong>
           It involues c electron. The a electrons which form a covalent bond are seldom shared equally between the two atoms. Due to different electronegatively electrons are displaced towards the more electronegative atom.
           <br/>
           This introduces a certain degree of polarity in the bond.
           <br/>
           The more electronegative atom acquires a small negative charge (δ
           <sup>
            –
           </sup>
           ). The less electronegative atom acquires a small positive charge (δ
           <sup>

           </sup>
           ).
           <br/>
           Consider the carbon-chlorine bond
           <br/>
           As chlorine is more electronegative, it will become negatively charged with respect to the carbon atom.

            Resonance Structure:
           </strong>
           A number of organic compounds cannot be accurately represented by one structure.
           <br/>
           For example, benzene is ordinarily represented as
           <br/>

           <br/>
           Carbon-carbon double bond length = 1.34 A
           <br/>
           Carbon-carbon single bond length = 1.54A. But it has been determined experimentally that all carbon-carbon bonds in benzene are identical and have same bond length (1.39A).
           <br/>
           Thus the structure of benzene cannot be represented by single structure. It can be represented equally well by ‘he energetically similar structures I and II. The two structures are called resonance structures.
           <br/>
           <img alt="Organic Chemistry Some Basic Principles and Techniques Chemistry Chapter 12 img-16" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-135996" height="96" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Organic-Chemistry-Some-Basic-Principles-and-Techniques-Chemistry-Chapter-12-img-16.png" width="300"/>
           <br/>
           Actual structure of benzene is resonance hybrid of structures I and II.

           The actual structure of nitromethane is a resonance hybrid of the two canonical forms I and II. Resonance energy: The difference in the energy between the most stable contributing structure for a compound and its resonance hybrid is called as resonance energy or resonance stabilisation energy.

           The polarity produced in the molecule by the interaction of two π-bonds or between a π-bond and a lone pair of electrons present on an adjacent atom. There are two types of resonance or mesomeric effects designated as R or M effect.

           Such structures are arrived at by shifting the bonding electrons from an adjacent C —H bond to the electron deficient carbon. In this way, the positive charge originally on carbon is dispersed to the hydrogen.
           <br/>
           This way of electron release by assuming no bond character in the adjacent C—H bond is called No-Bond Resonance or Hyperconjugation.

            • Orbital Concept of Hyperconjugation

           <br/>
           It involues delocalisation of o electrons of C—H bond of an alkyl group which is attached directly to an atom of unsaturated system or to an atom with an unshared p-orbital.

           (ethyl cation) in which the positively charged carbon atom has an empty p-orbital. One of the C—H bonds of the methyl group can align in the plane of this empty p-orbital and electron constituting the C—H bond in plane with this p-orbital can then be delocalised into the empty p-orbital as in Fig.

           In general, greater the number of alkyl groups attached to a positively charged carbon atom, the greater is the hyperconjugation.

           <br/>
           The organic substance is mixed intimately with about three times its weight of dry copper oxide. The mixture is then placed in a hard glass test-tube fitted with a bent delivery tube. The other end of which is dipping into lime water in another test tube.
           <br/>
           The mixture is heated strongly and the following reactions take place.

           Acidify a portion of ‘sodium extract’ with dilute nitric acid and add to it silver nitrate solution. White ppt. soluble in ammonia indicates Chlorine.
           <br/>
           Yellow ppt. sparingly soluble in ammonia indicates Bromine.
           <br/>
           Yellow ppt. insoluble in ammonia indicates Iodine.
           <br/>
           When nitrogen or sulphur is also present in the compound, the sodium extract before testing for halogens is boiled with strong nitric acid to decompose the cyanide and the sulphite formed during the sodium fusion. If not removed, these radicals will form a white and black precipitate respectively on the addition of silver nitrate.

           the nitrogen in it is converted to ammonium sulphate. The resultant liquid is then treated with excess of alkali and the liberated ammonia gas absorbed in excess of standard acid. The amount of ammonia is determined by finding the amount of acid neutralised by back filtration with some std. alkali.
