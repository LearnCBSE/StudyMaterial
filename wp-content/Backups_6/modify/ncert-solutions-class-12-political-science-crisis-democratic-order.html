           1. Janata party lacked direction, leadership and a common programme.
           <br/>
           2. Janata party government could not bring a fundamental change in policies pursued by Congress.
           <br/>
           3. There was a split in Janata Party and the government led by Morarji Desai which lost its majority in less than 18 months.
           <br/>
           4. Charan Singh government was formed due to support of Congress party which later decided to withdraw its support resulting resignation of Charan Singh government within four months.
           <br/>
           5. All the above mentioned reasons led midterm elections of 1980, which defeated Janata Party and again Congress led by Indira Gandhi came back to power by winning 353 seats.

           Emergency was proclaimed in response to petition filed by Raj Narain to declare Indira Gandhi’s election invalid.
           <br/>
           (i) On June 25, 1975, the government declared the threat of internal disturbances to invoke Article 352 of constitution.
           <br/>
           (ii) Article 352 can declare emergency on ground of either internal or external disturbances.
           <br/>
           (iii) The government decided a grave crisis to be arisen to proclaim emergency to bring law and order, restore efficiency and implement pro-poor welfare programmes.
           <br/>
           (iv) The President Fakhruddin Adi Ahmad proclaimed emergency which became the most controversial episode in Indian Politics.

           </span>
           The 1977 elections were evolved as a shock to everyone as Congress party was defeated for the very first time and opposition party came into power:
           <br/>
           1. The opposition adopted the slogan ‘Save democracy’ against imposition of emergency earlier.
           <br/>
           2. The opposition campaigned non- democratic character of rule which provided various excesses.
           <br/>
           3. The opposition party highlighted the preventive detention and press censorship to favour public opinion.
           <br/>
           4. Janata Party also ensured not to divide non-Congress votes.
           <br/>
           5. Middle section of north India was moving away from Congress for whom Janata Party became a platform.
           <br/>
           6. Hence, elections of 1977 emerged many other factors instead about emergency only.

           The emergency brought out weaknesses and strengths both to India’s democracy:
           <br/>

           2. Secondly, it amended that internal emergency could be proclaimed only on the grounds of armed rebellion, on the advice to the president to proclaim emergency must be given in writing by council of ministers.
           <br/>
           3. Thirdly, emergency made everyone more aware of civil liberties as well as courts also took an active role in protecting civil liberties of individuals.

           <strong>
            There were many acts of dissent and resistance to the Emergency. Many political workers who were not arrested in the first wave, went ‘underground’ and organised protests against the government. Newspapers like the Indian Express and the Statesman protested against censorship by leaving blank spaces where news items had been censored. Magazines like the Seminar and the Mainstream chose to close down rather than submit to censorship. Many journalists were arrested for writing against the Emergency. Many underground newsletters and leaflets were published to bypass censorship. Kannada writer Shivarama Karanth, awarded with Padma Bhushan, and Hindi writer Fanishwarnath Renu, awarded with Padma Shri, returned their awards in protest against the suspension of democracy. By and large, though, such open acts of defiance and resistance were rare.

             Answer:
            </strong>
           </span>
           (i) The emergency of 1975 at once brought out both the weaknesses’ and the strengths of India’s democracy. Though there are many observers who think that India ceased to be democratic during the emergency, it is noteworthy that normal democratic functioning resumed within a short span of time. Thus, one lesson of Emergency is that it is extremely difficult to do away with democracy in India.
           <br/>
           (ii) It brought out some ambiguities regarding the emergency provision in the constitution that have been rectified since. Now ‘internal’ emergency can be proclaimed only on the grounds of ‘armed rebellion’ and it is necessary that the advice to the President to proclaim emergency must be given in writing by the Council of Ministers.
           <br/>
           (iii) The Emergency made everyone aware of the value of civil liberties. The courts, too, have taken an active role after the emergency in protecting the civil liberties of the individuals. This is in response to the inability of the judiciary to protect civil liberties effectively during the emergency. Many civil liberties organizations came up after this experience.

             Answer:
            </strong>
           </span>
           (a) Effects on Civil Liberties of Citizens:
           <br/>
           1. The government made large scale arrests under preventive detention.
           <br/>
           2. Arrested political persons could not challenge arrest even under Habeas Corpus petition.
           <br/>
           3. Despite filing many petitions government claimed it not to be necessary to be informed of grounds to arrested persons.
           <br/>
           4. In April 1976, finally it was proved that the government could taken away citizen’s right to life and liberty by over ruling of high courts under supreme court and accepted government’s plea.
           <br/>
           (b) Impact on Relationship between Parliament and Judiciary:
           <br/>
           1. The parliament brought in many new changes in constitution which made an amendment declaring that election of Prime Minister, President and Vice¬president could not be challenged in the court.
           <br/>
           2. The forty-second amendment (42nd) was also passed to bring a series of changes in constitution like duration of legislatures, elections can be postponed by one year during an emergency.
           <br/>
           (c) Functioning of Mass Media:
           <br/>
           1. Press censorship took place
           <br/>
           which banned freedom of press is newspapers were supposed to seek prior approval before they publish any material.
           <br/>
           2. Protests, strikes and public agitations were also banned.
           <br/>
           3. Various fundamental rights were also suspended including even Right to move to Court for Restoration of Fundamental Rights.
           <br/>
           4. Kannada writer Shivarama Karnata awarded with Padma Bhushan and Hindi writer Fanishwarnath Renu with Padmashri returned their awards on protest against suspension of democracy.
           <br/>

           </span>
           The 1977 elections were evolved as a shock to everyone as Congress Party was defeated for the very first time and opposition party came into power:
           <br/>
           1. The opposition adopted the slogan ‘save democracy’ against imposition of emergency earlier.
           <br/>
           2. The opposition campaigned non- democratic character of rule which provided various excesses.
           <br/>
           3. The opposition party highlighted the preventive detention and press censorship to favour public opinion.
           <br/>
           4. Janata Party also ensured not to divide non-Congress votes.
           <br/>
           5. Middle section of North India was moving away from Congress for whom Janata Party became a platform.
           <br/>
           6. Hence, elections of 1977 emerged many other factors instead about emergency only.

           </span>
           The Naxalites were the Marxist and Leninist agricultural workers of Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar and adjoining areas which organised massive agilations against economic injustice and inequality and demanded redistribution of land to cultivators.
           <br/>
           Role in Indian Politics:
           <br/>
           1. Naxalite, did not participate in the elections formally but these were actively associated with parties.
           <br/>
           2. Naxalites ensured a better representation of demands of deprived social sections in party politics.
           <br/>
           3. These movements retained associations or relations alongwith the political parties either as an individual or as an organisations.
