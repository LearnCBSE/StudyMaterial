          <p>
           <strong>
            1.
           </strong>
           After double fertilisation, the following changes occur:
           <br/>
           (i)Endosperm and embryo development.
           <br/>
           (ii)Maturation of ovule(s) into seed(s).
           <br/>
           (iii)Maturation of ovary into fruit.
           <br/>
           These are collectively termed
           <strong>
            post-fertilisation
           </strong>
           events.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            2
           </strong>
           .Post-fertilisation changes in floral parts:
           <br/>
           (i)Sepals fall down or persist in few.
           <br/>
           (ii)Petals, stamen, stigma and style fall down.
           <br/>
           (iii)Ovary changes into fruit.
           <br/>
           (iv)Ovules become seeds.
           <br/>
           (v) Synergids and antipodal cells degenerate.
           <br/>
           (vi) Central cell become endosperm. May persist or get consumed.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            3
           </strong>
           .Endosperm development takes place by three methods:
           <br/>
           (i)Nuclear type (ii)Cellular type (iii)Helobial type
           <br/>
           (a)In nuclear type, which is a common method, the Primary Endosperm Nucleus (PEN) undergoes repeated mitotic division without cytokinesis. At this stage, the endosperm is called free nuclear endosperm.
           <br/>
           (b)Cell wall formation occurs and the endosperm becomes cellular type. The number of free nuclei formed before cellularisation varies greatly, e.g. in coconut the water is free nuclear endosperm and surrounding white kernel is cellular endosperm

          <p>
           <strong>
            4.Embryo formation
           </strong>
           occurs when certain amount of endosperm is formed.
           <br/>
           (i) Zygote divides by mitosis and forms proembiyo.
           <br/>
           (ii)This results in the formation of globular and heart-shaped embryo that finally becomes horse shoe-shaped (mature embryo) having cotyledon.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            5.
           </strong>
           Dicot embryo consists of two cotyledons and an embryonal axis between them:
           <br/>
           (i)The part of embryonal axis above the level of cotyledons is the epicotyl which becomes plumule (shoot).
           <br/>
           (ii)The part of embryonal axis below the level of cotyledons is the hypocotyl which becomes radicle (root).
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            6
           </strong>
           .Monocot embryo consists of only one cotyledon (called scutellum in grass family),
           <br/>
           e.g. rice, maize plants, etc.
           <br/>
           (i)Embryonal axis has the radicle on its lower end (hypocotyl), the radicle is covered over by an undifferentiated sheath called coleorhiza.
           <br/>
           (ii)At the upper end (epicotyl), the embryonal axis has plumule. It is covered by a hollow foliar sheath called coleoptile.

           <strong>
            7.
           </strong>
           Seed or fertilised ovule is the final product of sexual reproduction:
           <br/>
           (i)It consists of seed coat, cotyledons and an embryo axis.
           <br/>
           (ii)
           <strong>
            Non-albuminous
           </strong>
           seeds have no residual endosperm as it is completely consumed in embryo development, e.g. pea, groundnut.
           <br/>
           (iii)
           <strong>
            Albuminous
           </strong>
           seeds retain a part of endosperm as it is not completely used up during embryo development, e.g. wheat, maize, castor, sunflower, etc.
           <br/>
           (iv)In some seeds such as black pepper and beet, remnants of nucellus are also persistent (perisperm). Integuments of ovules harden as tough protective seed coat.
           <br/>
           (v) Micropyle remains as a small pore in the seed coat to allow the entry of oxygen and water.
           <br/>
           (vi) On the availability of favourable conditions, seeds germinate and later dispersed by abiotic and biotic agents.
           <br/>
           Seeds have following advantages:
           <br/>
           (i)Seeds help the species to spread in other areas by dispersal.
           <br/>
           (ii)They generate new combinations leading to variations.
           <br/>
           (iii)Seeds are stored and used as food throughout the year.
           <br/>
           (iv)They can be used in favourable seasons depending on their viability.
          </p>
          <p>
           8.Ovary develops into a fruit. The wall of the ovary develops into the fruit wall called
           <br/>
           <strong>
            pericarp.
           </strong>
           Types of fruits:
           <br/>
           (i)
           <strong>
            False fruits
           </strong>
           Thalamus also contributes in fruit formation, e.g. apple, strawberry, cashewnuts, etc.
           <br/>
           (ii)
           <strong>
            True fruits
           </strong>
           These fruits develop from ovary, e.g. grapes, cucumber, etc.
           <br/>
           (iii)
           <strong>
            Parthenocarpic fruits
           </strong>
           These fruits develop without fertilisation, e.g. banana. parthenocarpy can be induced through growth hormones and such fruits are seedless.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            9.Special Cases
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (i)Apomixis
           </strong>
           is the special mechanism to produce seeds without fertilisation, e.g. grass. It is a form of asexual reproduction that mimics sexual reproduction. It is useful for the hybrid industry.
           <br/>
           The modes by which apomictic seeds can be produced are agamospery, adventive embryony, etc.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (ii)Polyembryony
           </strong>
           is the presence of more than one embryo in a seed. In many Citrus and mango varieties, some of the nucellar cells surrounding the embryo sac start dividing, protrude into the embryo sac and develop into embryos.

            1.Banana is a true fruit but is also a parthenocarpic fruit. Give reason.[Foreign 2010]
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           The fruit of banana is formed from the ovary, so it is a true fruit. It is a parthenocarpic fruit because the ovary develops into fruit without fertilisation and is thus, seedless.
          </p>

           <strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           In apple, the thalamus also contributes to fruit formation. So, apples are called false fruits.

            Ans.
           </strong>
           (i)Embryo development occurs after endosperm development in angiosperms.
           <br/>
           (ii) The three methods of endosperm development are:
           <br/>
           (a)nuclear type (b) cellular type
           <br/>
           (c)helobial type
           <br/>
           (iii) Nuclear type is the common method in which triploid Primary Endosperm Nucleus (PEN) undergoes repeated mitotic division without cytokinesis. This stage is called free-nuclear endosperm.
           <br/>
           (iv)Cell wall formation starts from the periphery and the endosperm becomes completely cellular, e.g. coconut, rice, etc.
           <br/>
           (v)Cells of the endosperm store food materials.
           <br/>
           (vi)Endosperm may be completely utilised by the developing embryo before the maturation of seeds as in pea, bean, mustard, etc. These seeds are called non-albuminous or endospermic seeds.
           <br/>
           (vii) In seeds like castor, maize, coconut, rice, etc., a portion of it may remain in the mature seeds, such seeds are called albuminous or endospermic seeds

           .(i)Parthenocarpy is development and production of seedless fruits in the absence of fertilisation, whereas apomixis refers to development of seeds and fruits, without fertilisation. So, the main difference between apomixis and parthenocarpy is that seeds are formed in former, while absent in later.
           <br/>
           (ii) The two modes by which apomictic seeds can be produced are:
           <br/>

           (b)
           <strong>
            Adventive embryony
           </strong>
           The method in which diploid cells surrounding the embryo sac, e.g nucellus and integument protrude into the sac and develops into embryo. This may also lead to formation of more than one embryos in an embryo sac or ovule, leading to condition called polyembryony, e.g. Citrus,Opuntia.

This phenomenon of developing embryo and seeds without fertilisation is called apomixis and such seeds produced are referred to as apomictic.

            Development of endosperm
           </strong>
           <br/>
           (i)Embryo development occurs after endosperm development in angiosperms.
           <br/>
           (ii) The three methods of endosperm development are:
           <br/>
           (a)nuclear type (b) cellular type
           <br/>
           (c)helobial type
           <br/>
           (iii) Nuclear type is the common method in which triploid Primary Endosperm Nucleus (PEN) undergoes repeated mitotic division without cytokinesis. This stage is called free-nuclear endosperm.
           <br/>
           (iv)Cell wall formation starts from the periphery and the endosperm becomes completely cellular, e.g. coconut, rice, etc.
           <br/>
           (v)Cells of the endosperm store food materials.
           <br/>
           (vi)Endosperm may be completely utilised by the developing embryo before the maturation of seeds as in pea, bean, mustard, etc. These seeds are called non-albuminous or endospermic seeds.
           <br/>
           (vii) In seeds like castor, maize, coconut, rice, etc., a portion of it may remain in the mature seeds, such seeds are called albuminous or endospermic seeds

            Embryo development in dicot plant
           </strong>

           (i) Embryo formation starts after a certain amount of endosperm is formed.
           <br/>
           (ii) Zygote divides by mitosis to form a proembryo.
           <br/>
           (iii) Formation of globular and heart-shaped embryo occurs which finally becomes horse shoe-shaped mature embryo.
           <br/>
           (iv) In dicot plant, embryo consists of two cotyledons and an embryonal axis between them.
           <br/>
           (v)The portion of embryonal axis above the level of attachment of cotyledons is epicotyl and terminates in the plumule.
           <br/>
           (vi)The portion of embryonal axis below the level of attachment of cotyledon is the hypocotyl, it becomes radicle (root tip).

           (a)The embryo development starts only after a certain amount of endosperm is formed. It is an adaptation for assured nutrition of the developing embryo. Therefore, endosperm development precedes embryo development. The role of endosperm in mature albuminous seeds is storage of reserve food for growing embryo.

           (ii) Endosperm formation
           <br/>
           (a)Primary endosperm cell divides repeatedly and forms triploid endosperm nucleus.
           <br/>
           (b)Primary endosperm nucleus undergoes successive free nuclear divisions to give rise to a number of free nuclei. At this stage, it is called free nuclear endosperm.
           <br/>
           (c)Wall formation takes place from the periphery and proceeds towards the centre and the endosperm becomes cellular.
           <br/>
           (d)In albuminous seeds, some amount of endosperm persists in the mature seed as the developing embryo does not consume it completely,

           e.g. wheat /maize.
           <br/>
           (e)In exalbuminous seeds, the endosperm is completely consumed by the developing embryo before seed maturation,
