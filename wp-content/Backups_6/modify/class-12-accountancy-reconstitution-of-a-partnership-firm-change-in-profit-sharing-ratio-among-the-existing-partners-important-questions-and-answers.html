           (i) Calculation of Change in Profit Share of Partners
           <br/>
           Sacrificing/(Gaining) Share = Old Share – New Share
           <br/>
           Anant’s Sacrifice/(Gain) = \(\frac { 5 }{ 10 }\) – \(\frac { 1 }{ 3 }\) = \(\frac { 15-10 }{ 30 }\) = \(\frac { 5 }{ 30 }\) Sacrifice
           <br/>
           Gulab’s Sacrifice/(Gain) = \(\frac { 3 }{ 10 }\) – \(\frac { 1 }{ 3 }\) = \(\frac { 9-10 }{ 30 }\) = (\(\frac { 1 }{ 30 }\)) Gain
           <br/>
           Khushbu’s Sacrifice/(Gain) = \(\frac { 2 }{ 10 }\) – \(\frac { 1 }{ 3 }\) = \(\frac { 6-10 }{ 30 }\) = (\(\frac { 4 }{ 30 }\)) Gain

           (ii) Calculation of Share of Goodwill
           <br/>
           Anant = 2,40,000 × \(\frac { 5 }{ 30 }\) = ₹ 40,000 30
           <br/>
           Gulab = 2,40,000 × \(\frac { 1 }{ 30 }\) = ₹ 8,000 30
           <br/>
           Khushbu = 2,40,000 × \(\frac { 4 }{ 30 }\) = ₹ 32,000

           1. Calculation of Sacrificing or Gaining Ratio
           <br/>
           Sacrificing Ratio = Old Share – New Share
           <br/>
           Radhika = \(\frac{2}{6}-\frac{3}{6}=\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)\) = Bani = \(\frac{3}{6}-\frac{2}{6}=\frac{1}{6}\) Chitra = \(\frac { 1 }{ 6 }\) – \(\frac { 1 }{ 6 }\) = Nil

           2. Firms Goodwill = ₹ 1,80,000
           <br/>
           Radhika gains and Bani sacrifice = 1,80,000 × \(\frac { 1 }{ 6 }\) = ₹ 30,000

           Kumar, Gupta and Kavita were partners in a firm sharing profits and losses equally. The firm was engaged in the storage and distribution of canned juice and its godowns were located at three different places in the city. Each godown was being managed individually by Kumar, Gupta and Kavita. Because of increase in business activities at the godown managed by Gupta, he had to devote more time.
           <br/>
           Gupta demanded that his share in the profits of the firm be increased, to which Kumar and Kavita agreed. The new profit sharing ratio was agreed to be 1 : 2 : 1.
           <br/>
           For this purpose the goodwill of the firm was valued at two years’ purchase of the average profits of last five years. The profits of the last five years were as follows

           Goodwill = Average Profits × Number of Years’ Purchase
