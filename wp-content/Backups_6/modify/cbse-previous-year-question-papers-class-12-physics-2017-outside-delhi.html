           Question 14.
           <br/>
           Using photon picture of light, show how Einstein’s photoelectric equation can be established. Write two features of photoelectric effect which cannot be explained by wave theory. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           Einstein’s photoelectric equation : Einstein explained the various laws of photo¬electric emission on the basis of Planck’s quantum theory. According to Planck’s quantum theory, light radiations consist of tiny packets of energy called quanta. One quantum of light radiation is called a photon which travels with the speed of light.
           <br/>
           The energy of a photon is given by,
           <br/>
           E=hv
           <br/>
           where h is Planck’s constant and u is the frequency of light radiation. Einstein assumed that one photo electron is ejected from a metal surface if one photon of suitable light radiation falls on it. Consider a photon of light of frequency u, incident on a photosensitive metal surface. The energy of the photon (= hv) is spent in two ways :
           <br/>
           (a) A part of the energy of the photon is used in liberating the electron from the metal surface which is equal to the work function Φ
           <sub>
            0
           </sub>
           of the metal.
           <br/>
           (b) The rest of the energy of the photon is used in imparting the kinetic energy to the emitted photo electron. If V
           <sub>
            max
           </sub>
           is the maximum velocity of the emitted photoelectron and m is its mass, then
           <br/>
           Max. K.E. of the photoelectron,
           <br/>

           <br/>
           This equation is called Einstein’s photoelectric equation.

           Features of photoelectric effect which can not be explained by wave theory:
           <br/>
           1. The wave theory could not explain the instantaneous process of photoelectric effect.
           <br/>
           2. Maximum fcinetic energy’ of the emitted photoetectrous is independent of intensity of incident light.

           (a) Biot-Savart Law :
           <br/>
           It states that the magnetic field strength (dB) produced due to a current element I and length dl at a point having position vector \(\vec{r}\) relative to current element is
           <br/>
           (i) directly proportional to the current I i.e., dB ∝ I
           <br/>
           (ii) directly proportional to the length dl of the element i.e., dB ∝ dl.
           <br/>
           (iii) directly proportional to sin θ, where θ is the angle between dl and r, i.e., dB ∝ sin θ .

           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a)The device X is a capacitor.
           <br/>
           (b) The curves A,B and C represents power consumption,voltage and currentrespectively. Since, it is given V = V
           <sub>
            0
           </sub>
           sin ωt; this sinusoidal variation is represented by the curve B. In case of capacitor, current (I) leads the voltage by 90° which is being represented by curve C. Now, we know power is given by
           <br/>
           P = V× I
           <br/>
           So, the power would be positive for those cycles where both V and I are either positive or negative. Power would be negative when one of the two voltage or current, is negative. This illustration is followed by the curve A.

           <br/>
           This is the snell’s law of refraction.
           <br/>
           (b) When a beam of white light is passed through a medium containing particles whose size is of the order of wavelength of light, then the beam gets scattered. When the scattered light is viewed through an analyser in a direction at the right angle to the direction of incidence, it is found to be plane polarised. This is called polarization by scattering.

           <br/>
           (a) Photoelectric current in a photocell increases with the increase in the intensity of the incident radiation.
           <br/>
           (b) The stopping potential (V
           <sub>
            0
           </sub>
           ) varies linearly with the frequency (v) of the incident radiation for a given photosensitive surface with the slope remaining the same for different surfaces.
           <br/>
           (c) Maximum kinetic energy of the photo electrons is independent of the intensity of incident radiation.
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           (a) Since number of photo electrons emitted is directly proportional to the intensity of incident radiation therefore, as intensity increases the electron-hole pairs also increases.

           Question 1.
           <br/>
           What is the direction of induced currents in metal rings 1 and 2 when current I in the wire is increasing steadily ?
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 Physics 2017 Outside Delhi 60" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-127012" height="165" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Physics-2017-Outside-Delhi-60.png" width="225"/>
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Ring – 1 → Clockwise
           <br/>
           Ring – 2 → Anticlockwise
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           In which directions do the electric and magnetic field vectors oscillate in an electromagnetic wave propagating along the x-axis ? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Electric component → Y – axis
           <br/>
           Magnetic component → Z – axis
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Why does current in a steady state not flow in a capacitor connected across a battery ? However momentary current does flow during charging or discharging of the capacitor. Explain. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           When there is change in the electric flux there will be a displacement current and when flux is fixed the displacement as well as conduction current will be zero.

           Question 4.
           <br/>
           The ground state energy of hydrogen atom is -13.6 eV. If an electron makes a transition from an energy level – 1.51 eV to – 3.4 eV, calculate the wavelength of the spectral line emitted and name the series of hydrogen spectrum to which it belongs. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When energy is -1.51 eV then n = 3. When energy is – 3.4 eV then n- 2.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The value of R has to be increase because on heating, the conductivity of a semiconductor increases, i.e. resistance of S decreases on heating.

           Working : In photodiode an electric field exists across the junction from n-side to p-side. When visible light with energy hv greater than energy gap (E
           <sub>
            g
           </sub>
           ) illuminates the junction, then electron-hole pairs are generated in the depletion layer. Due to electric field electron moves towards n side and holes towards p-side give rise to an emf. when an external load is connected current flows.
