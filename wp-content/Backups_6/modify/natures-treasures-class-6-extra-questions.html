           Question 7.
           <br/>
           What is atmosphere?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Our earth is surrounded by a thin layer of air. This layer is called atmosphere. It extends up to many kilometres above the surface of the earth.

          <p>
           Question 8.
           <br/>
           Why is atmosphere called the place where exchange of gases in nature occurs?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           We know that various gases are found in air. Now some organisms live on land, some in water and some deep under the soil. But all need oxygen to respire. The terrestrial organisms take oxygen from the atmosphere. You know that during respiration by living beings and burning of materials, carbon dioxide is produced along with some other gases. Also CO&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is used by the plants in the process of photosynthesis in which oxygen is released. All gases go into the atmosphere. Thus, it is a place in nature for gaseous exchange.

           The mountaineers carry oxygen cylinder with them while climbing high mountains. Why?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The availability of air decreases gradually as we go up in the atmosphere.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 10.

           Question 6.
           <br/>
           What is rainwater harvesting? Describe the method of rainwater harvesting.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Rainwater harvesting is the collection of rainwater and storing for future use. In this system rainwater in collected from the rooftops by means of pipes into storage tank for later use. Recycling water and water harvesting also help in saving water.
          </p>
          <p>
           Methods of Rainwater Harvesting:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Rooftop rainwater harvesting. In this system, the rainwater from the rooftop is collected in a storage tank, through pipes.
           </li>
           <li>
            Another method, a big pit is dug near house for collecting rainwater. This pit is filled with different layers of bricks, coarse gravels and sand or granite pieces.
           </li>

            Forests Class 6 Extra Questions
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           What are forests?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Forests are large areas with dense growth of various types of plants (herbs, shrubs and trees). Forests are a natural home for many wild animals, including birds and insects. Forests provide food and shelter to them.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Why should we worry about the conditions and issues related to forests far from us?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           We should worry about the conditions and issues related to forests even far from us because forests play an important role for the sustenance of life on earth. The following points illustrate the importance of forests for us :
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Forests help in maintaining the ratio of oxygen and carbon dioxide in air.
           </li>
           <li>
            Forests provide habitat to a wide variety of plants and animals.
           </li>
           <li>
            Forests provide firewood, timber, medicines, fruits, rubber, gum, resins, honey, bee-wax, paper and many other products.
           </li>
           <li>
            Forests reduce the speed of flowing water and help in controlling floods.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Explain how animals dwelling in the forest help it grow and regenerate.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           We can see a bunch of seedlings sprouting in a decaying heap of animal droppings especially in rainy seasons. These seedlings are the herbs and shrubs. The animals also disperse the seeds of certain plants and help the forest to grow and regenerate. The decaying animal dung also provides nutrients to the seedlings to grow.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Explain how forests prevent floods.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Raindrops in a forest do not hit the ground directly. The uppermost layer of the forest canopy intercepts the raindrops, and most of the water comes down up to soil through the branches and the stems of the trees. From the leaves it drops slowly over the branches of the shrubs and herbs. Also forest trees have extensive deep roots that absorb and store rain water. Thus forests act as a natural absorber of rainwater and allows it to seep and therefore help in controlling floods.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Explain Van-Mahotsav.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Van-Mahotsav is a week-long event celebrated across the country during the month of July. It is a forest festival during which new plants and trees are planted and awareness about respecting forests is raised.

          <p>
           Question 6.
           <br/>
           Explain the role of forest in maintaining the balance between oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Plants release oxygen as a by product during the process of photosynthesis. This oxygen is inhaled by animals for respiration. This respiration process releases carbon dioxide which is used again by plants during photosynthesis. In this way, use and consumption of oxygen and carbon dioxide goes on. Thus, they maintain the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

           Question 7.
           <br/>
           How does the forest floor look like?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The forest floor looks dark- coloured and is covered with a layer of dead and decaying leaves, fruits, seeds, twigs and small herbs. The decaying matter is moist and warm. Walking over the dead leaf layer on the forest floor is like walking over a spongy carpet.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 8.
           <br/>
           What is the importance of dense bushes and tall grasses for animals living in the forest?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The dense bushes and the tall grasses provide the food and shelter to the animals. They also protect them from carnivores that live in the forest.
