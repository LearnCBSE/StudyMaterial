            1. In this chapter you have read that health is a wider concept than illness. Look at this quote from the Constitution and explain the terms ‘living standard’ and ‘public health’ in your own words.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            An important part of the Constitution says it is the “duty of the state to raise the level of nutrition and the standard of living and to improve public health. ”

               </li>
               <li>
                If one leads a comfortable life, the living standard is said to be of a higher level.

           <strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Water and sanitation are the basic necessities for the maintenance of our health. Poor quality of water causes a lot of health problems. Similarly, poor sanitation causes many epidemics giving birth to dangerous insects and worms. Recently we saw the spread of Dengue caused by Aedes (a mosquito). Malaria is also caused by a mosquito called anopheles. Improvement in water and sanitation can control these happenings.

           It is because women’s health concerns are considered to be less important than the health of men in the family.

            Answer:
           </strong>
           The common definition of health is the ability of a person to remain free of illness and injuries. But health is not only about the disease. It is something more than that. Apart from disease, we need to think of other factors such as safe drinking water, clean surroundings, etc. because they affect our health in various ways. If people fail to get these basic amenities of life, they will fall ill. Being active and in good spirits are also an essential part of health. We also need to be without mental stress, because we cannot be healthy for a long time if we are under mental strain.

            Answer:
           </strong>
           The court said that the difficulty that Hakim Sheik had to face could have cost him his life. If a hospital cannot provide timely medical treatment to a person, it means that the protection of life is not being given. The court also said that it was the duty of the government to provide the necessary health services, including treatment in emergency situations. Hospitals and medical staff must fulfill their duty of providing essential treatment. As various government hospitals refused to admit him, the State Government was asked to give Hakim Sheik the money that he had spent on his treatment.

           <strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           We can say without any doubt that adequate healthcare is not available to all in our country. The reason is that private services are increasing but public services are not. As a result, private services are mainly available to people. But these services are concentrated in urban areas and are very expensive.
          </p>
          <p>
           Poor people hardly afford them whenever there is an illness in the family, they either borrow money or sell some of their possessions to pay for the expenses. Thus, medical expenses cause great hardship for the poor. Therefore, they avoid going to the doctor unless it is very urgent.
          </p>
          <p>
           It has been found that women are not taken to a doctor in a prompt manner. Their health concerns are easily ignored. Many tribal areas have few health centres and they do not run properly.

            Answer:
           </strong>
           (a) Public health services are run by the government while private health services are managed by individuals or companies.
           <br/>
           (b) Public health services provide health care facilities either free or at a low cost so that even the poor can seek treatment easily. Thus, money-making is not the goal of public health services. So far private health services are concerned, they are run mainly for profit. They usually prescribe expensive medicines. It is common for private doctors to prescribe unnecessary medicines, injections or saline bottles when tablets or simple medicines can suffice.
           <br/>
           (c) Public health services are found both in rural and urban areas. But private health services are concentrated in urban areas.
           <br/>
           (d) We often find huge rush at the government hospitals. People have to wait for hours in a long queue. But private hospitals are maintained properly. People don’t face such long queues there.

            Answer:
           </strong>
           Costa Rica is a country in North America. It is considered to be one of the wealthiest countries on the continent. The Costa Rican govt gave much importance to the health of its citizens. It took an important decision and decided not to have an army. In this way, it saved money and began to spend this money on health, education, and other basic needs of the people. The Costa Rican government believes that a country has to be healthy for its development and pays sincere attention to the health of its people.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Costa Rican government provides all the basic services and amenities to all the people of the country. It provides clean drinking water, sanitation, nutrition, and housing. Health education has been made an important part of education and at all levels, students are provided knowledge about health. The Costa Rican approach towards health is praiseworthy and inspiring.

           <strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           The Kerala government made some major changes in the state in 1996. It gave 40% of the entire state budget to panchayats so that they could plan and provide for their requirements. This made it possible for a village to make sure that proper planning was done for water, food, women’s development, and education.
          </p>
          <p>
           In this way water supply schemes were checked, the working of schools and anganwadis were ensured and specific problems of the village were taken up. Health centres were also improved.
          </p>
          <p>
           In spite of all these efforts, some problems such as shortage of medicines, insufficient hospital beds, not enough doctors still exist and these are needed to be solved.
