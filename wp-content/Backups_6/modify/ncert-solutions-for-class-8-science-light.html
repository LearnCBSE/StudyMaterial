          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Suppose you are in a dark room. Can you see objects in the room? Can you see objects out¬side the room? Explain.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When we are in a dark room then we cannot see objects in the room. We can see the objects outside the room, because out of the room the light is available and the rays of light can enter our eyes after reflection from the objects.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Differentiate between regular and diffused reflection. Does diffused reflection mean the failure of the laws of reflection?
           <br/>

            Regular reflection will take place because the surface is plane and polished.
           </li>
           <li>
            Diffused reflection will take place because the surface is rough.
           </li>
           <li>
            Diffused reflection will take place because the surface is rough.
           </li>
           <li>
            Regular reflection will take place because the surface is smooth and plane.

           Question 4.
           <br/>
           State the laws of reflection.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The laws of reflections are:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The incident ray, the normal and the reflected ray, all lie in the same plane.
           </li>
           <li>
            The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Describe an activity to show that the incident ray, the reflected ray and the normal at the point of incidence lie in the same plane.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Activity: To show that the incident ray, reflected ray and the normal at the point of incidence lie in the same plane.
           <br/>
           Materials Required: Plane mirror, holder, ray box, etc.
           <br/>
           Procedure: Fix sheet of white paper, a little beyond the edge of the board. Place a plane mirror strip vertically to the paper using a stand. Throw light from a ray box on the mirror. Look at the reflected ray. Mark the incident ray, normal ray and reflected ray. Fold the paper which is beyond the edge of the board. You will observe that the reflected ray is not seen in the folded portion of the chart paper. Now bring the folded portion back to its original position. The reflected ray of light is again seen on the page.
           <br/>
           Conclusion: The sheet on the board can be considered as a plane. The incident ray, the reflected ray, the normal at the point of incidence lie in the same plane.

           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Describe the construction of a kaleidoscope.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Kaleidoscope is a device based on the principle of multiple reflections. It consists of three long and narrow strips of plane mirrors inclined at an angle of 60° to one another forming prism. This is fitted in a tube. One end of this tube is closed by a cardboard disc having a hole at its centre. To the other end touching the mirrors plane glass plate is fixed on which broken pieces of coloured bangles are placed. This end of the tube is closed by a ground glass plate.

           Question 13.
           <br/>
           What is the angle of incidence of a ray if the reflected ray is at an angle of 90° to the incident ray?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Here, the angle of reflection is 90°. As we know, according to the laws of reflection that angle of incidence is equal to angle of reflection.
           <br/>
           Here, the angle between the incident ray and reflected ray is 90°.
           <br/>
           i.e., ∠i + ∠r = 90°
           <br/>
           Since, ∠i = ∠r
           <br/>
           We can write, ∠i + ∠i = 90°
           <br/>
           ⇒ 2∠i = 90°
           <br/>
           ⇒ ∠i = 45°
           <br/>
           Angle of incidence = 45°.

           Question 14.
           <br/>
           How many images of a candle will be formed if it is placed between two parallel plane mir¬rors separated by 40 cm?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Here, mirrors are placed parallel to each other 40 cm apart. Therefore, the infinite number of images will be formed.

           <br/>
           Fix a white sheet of paper on a drawing board or a table. Take a comb and close all its openings except one in the middle. You can use a strip of black paper for this purpose. Hold the comb perpendicular to the sheet of paper. Throw light from a torch through the opening of the comb from one side (Fig. 16.5). With slight adjustment of the torch and the comb you will see a ray of light along the paper on the other side of the comb. Keep the comb and the torch steady. Place a strip of plane mirror in the path of the light ray (Fig. 16.5). What do you observe?

           Perform Activity 16.1 again. This time use a sheet of stiff paper or a chart paper. Let the sheet project a little beyond the edge of the Table (Fig. 16.6). Cut the projecting portion of the sheet in the middle. Look at the reflected ray. Make sure that the reflected ray extends to the projected portion of the paper. Bend that part of the projected portion on which the reflected ray falls. Can you still see the reflected ray? Bring the paperback to the original position. Can you see the reflected ray again? What do you infer?

           A source of light 0 is placed in front of a plane mirror PQ. Two rays OA and OC are incident on it (Fig. 16.7). Can you find out the direction of the reflected rays?
           <br/>
           Draw normals to the surface of the mirror PQ, at the points A and C.Then draw the reflected rays at the points A and C. How would you draw these rays? Call the reflected rays AB and CD, respectively. Extend them further. Do they meet? Extend them backward. Do they meet now? If they meet, mark this point as I. For a viewer’s eye at E (Fig. 16.7), do the reflected rays appear to come from the point I. Since the reflected rays do not actually meet at I, but only appear to do so, we say that a virtual image of the point O is formed at I. As you have learnt already in Class VII, such an image cannot be obtained on a screen.

           Jake two plane mirrors. Set them at right angles to each other with their edges touching (Fig. 16.10).To hinge them you can use adhesive tape. Place a coin in between the mirrors. How many images of the coin do you see (Fig. 16.10)?
           <br/>

           <br/>
           Now hinge the mirrors using the adhesive tape at different angles, say 45°, 60°, 120°, 180°, etc. Place some object (say a candle) in between them. Note down the number of images of the object in each case.
           <br/>
           Finally, set the two mirrors parallel to each other. Find out how many images of a candle placed between them are formed (Fig. 16.11).
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           (i) When two plane mirrors are joined at right angles, then three images are formed.
           <br/>
           (ii) When two plane mirrors are joined at 45°, 7 images are formed.
           <br/>
           (iii) When two plane mirrors are joined at 60°, 5 images are formed.
           <br/>
           (iv) When two plane mirrors are joined at 120°, 2 images are formed.
           <br/>
           (v) When two plane mirrors are joined at 180°, 1 image is formed.
           <br/>
           (vi) When the plane mirrors are parallel to each other, infinite images are formed.

           Activity 6 (NCERT Textbook, Page 206)
           <br/>
           To make a kaleidoscope, get three rectangular mirror strips each about 15 cm long and 4 cm wide. Join them together to form a prism as shown in Fig. 16.12(a). Fix them in a circular cardboard tube or tube of a thick chart paper. Make sure that the tube is slightly longer than the mirror strips. Close one end of the tube by a cardboard disc having a hole in the centre, through which you can see [Fig. 16.12(b)]. To make the disc durable, paste a piece of transparent plastic sheet under the cardboard disc. At the other end, touching the mirrors, fix a circular plane glass plate [Fig. 16.12(c)]. Place on this glass plate several small pieces of coloured glass (broken pieces of coloured bangles). Close this end of the tube by a ground glass plate. Allow enough space for the colour pieces to move around.

           Activity 7 (NCERT Textbook, Page 205)
           <br/>
           Get a plane mirror of a suitable size. Place it in a bowl (katori) as shown in Fig. 16.13, Fill the bowl with water. Put this arrangement near a window in such a way that direct sunlight falls on the mirror. Adjust the position of the bowl so that the reflected light from the mirror falls on a wall. If the wall is not white, fix a sheet of white paper on it. Reflected light will be seen to have many colours. How can you explain this?

           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           The mirror and water form a prism and breaks up the light into its colours. Splitting of light into its colours is known as dispersion of light. Rainbow is a natural phenomenon showing dispersion.

           Activity 8 (NCERT Textbook, page 206)
           <br/>
           Look into your friend’s eye. Observe the size of the pupil.Throw light on her
           <br/>
           eye with a torch. Observe the pupil now. Switch off the torch, and observe her pupil once again. Do you notice any change in the size of the pupil? In which case was the pupil larger? Why do you think it was so?
           <br/>
           In which case do you need to allow more light in the eye, when the light is dim or bright?
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           When the light from the torch falls on the pupil, its size becomes smaller to allow less amount of light to enter into the retina. When light is switched off, pupil enlarges to allow more light to enter into the retina. Thus, pupil controls the amount of light entering into the eye.

           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Yes, the cross disappears. The disappearance of the cross or the round mark shows that there is a point on the retina which cannot send messages to the brain when light falls on it.

           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Yes, we can seethe bird in the cage.Thus, impression of an image persist in retina for about 1/16th of a second.

            Answer:
           </span>
           <br/>
           The water droplets suspended in the air after the rain act as prisms. When the sun is towards the horizon the inclined rays pass through the water drops to disperse into the seven colours of the specturm.

            Question 7.
           </span>
           <br/>
           Why does white light disperse when it passes through a glass prism ?
           <br/>
           <span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer:
           </span>
           <br/>
           White light is a combination of seven colours of light. The speed of each colour is different. So, while passing through the glass prism each colour deviates by different amounts. Therefore, despersion of light into a spectrum takes place.

            Answer:
           </span>
           <br/>
           The day birds can see clearly during the day but not at night. The day birds have more cones and less rods. The cones are sensitive to bright light and can sense colours. Night birds can see clearly at night but not cjuring the day. Their eyes have a large cornea and pupil to allow more lighted pass. Also their retina has mostly rods and few cones. Rods are more sensitive to dim light. –

            Answer:
           </span>
           <br/>
           Visually impaired people can communicate by following methods :
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            By using the Braille system which employs groups of dots to represent printed letters and numbers.
           </li>
           <li>
            in 1980, Braille computer software was developed. It can input, output and translate documents to and from Braille.
           </li>
           <li>
            by speech technology that can convert ordinary text into speech.

            Answer:
           </span>
           <br/>
           Every character in the Braille code is based on the arrangement of one to six raised dots. Each dot has a numbered position in the Braille cell. These characters make up the letters of the alphabet, punctuation marks, numbers and everything else that can be printed does not have a separate alphabet of capital letters as there is in a print.

           </span>
           <br/>
           Differentiate between regular and diffused reflection. Does diffused reflection mean the failure of the laws of reflection ? [NCERT]

            Answer:
           </span>
           <br/>
           When the reflected rays are parallel to each other, it is known as regular reflection. When the reflected rays are not parallel, the reflection is known as diffused or irregular reflection. Diffused reflection is not due to the failure of the laws of reflection. It is caused by irregularities in the reflecting surface.

           </span>
           <br/>
           To make a kaleidoscope, get three rectangular strips of glass 15 cm long and 4 cm wide each. Join them together to form a prism. Fix them with a few thick chart papers in a slightly long circular tube. Close one end of the tube by a cardboard disc having a hole in centre. At the other end touching the mirrors fix a circular plane glass sheet. Invert the tube and place some broken small pieces of coloured bangles on the glass plate. Close this end of the tube by a ground glass plate.
