           Six point charges, each of the same magnitude q, are arranged in different manners as shown in Column – II. In each case, a point M and a line PQ passing through M are shown. Let E be the electric field and V be the electric potential at M (Potential at infinity is zero) due to the given charge distribution when it is at rest. Now, the whole system is set into rotation with a constant angular velocity about the line PQ. Let B be the magnetic field at M and p be the magnetic moment of the system in this condition. Assume each rotating charge to be equivalent to a steady current. [2009]

           As here battery remains attached to the circuit V=constant. Now as due to lowering of plates in the oil, capacity will increase gradually and as q=CV the charge on capacitor will increase. This gradual increase in q results in current drawn from the battery.If at any instant, y length of plate is dipped in oil, the system will be equivalent to two capacitors in parallel, one with air and the other with oil as dielectric so that
