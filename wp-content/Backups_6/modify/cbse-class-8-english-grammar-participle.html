           . Here we have given CBSE Class 8 English Grammar Participle.
          </p>
          <h2>
           CBSE Class 8 English Grammar Participle
          </h2>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Read the sentence :
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Going on the road, the boy met with an accident.
           <br/>
           The word ‘going’ qualifies the noun ‘boy’ as an adjective does. It is formed from the word ‘go’. The word ‘going’ therefore has something of an adjective and something of a verb too. Such words are called Participle. It may be called a verbal Adjective.
           <br/>
           Def. A participle is a form of verb which takes the nature of both—a verb and an adjective. .
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            2. Study the following sentences with participles :
           </strong>
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <ol>
           <li>
            We met a boy carrying books.
           </li>
           <li>
            Knocking at the gate, he was crying bitterly.
           </li>
           <li>
            Thinking about the problem, he sat down.
           </li>
           <li>
            He fell down fighting.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           The participles used in the above sentences end with-ing. They are called present participles. Please note that present participles represent an action in progress or we may say the action which is incomplete and going on.
          </p>
          <p>
           3. However, a participle can represent an action which has been completed. In such cases the third, form of the verb is used. Such participles are called Past Participle.
           <br/>
           Study the following sentences :
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Blinded by dust, the man stopped on the road.
           </li>
           <li>
            Deceived by friends, he felt very sad.
           </li>
           <li>
            Time wasted is the time lost.
           </li>
           <li>
            Tired by walking, he called a cab.
           </li>
           <li>
            I saw a plant laden with flowers.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           Besides the Present Participle and the Past Participle, we have Perfect Participle too. It represents an action completed at some past time.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Use of Participle
           </strong>
           <br/>
           4. You can easily see that the ‘continuous tense’ is formed from the ‘present partici¬ple’ with the verb ‘be’.
           <br/>
           I am reading. I was reading. I shall be reading.
           <br/>
           Similarly, the Perfect Tense is formed with Past Participle with the verb ‘have’.
           <br/>
           I have read. I had read. I shall have read.
          </p>
          <p>
           5. We have seen that the participles serve the purpose of an adjective. They may be used before or after the noun they qualify :
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) Before the noun ; (attributively)
           <br/>
           The moving wheel moves on.
           <br/>
           The tired man needs rest.
           <br/>
           The finished picture was a beauty.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           (ii) After the noun. (Predicatively)
           <br/>
           He seems worried.
           <br/>
           He kept me waiting.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Absolutely with a noun or pronoun before it.
           <br/>
           It being fine, I went out.
           <br/>
           The teacher having arrived, the boys became quiet.
           <br/>
           Weather permitting, the match will start.
           <br/>
           God willing. I shall be rich.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Note:
           </strong>
           It should be noted that in the above sentences, (iii) the participle forms a phrase independent of the rest of the sentence. In the above sentences these phrases are—It being fine. The teacher having arrived : Weather permitting and God willing. These phrases are called Absolute Phrases and the noun or pronoun used in these phrases are called Nominative Absolute.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>
            Errors In The Use of Participles
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           6. The participles must refer to a ‘subject’. Without it the sentence is incorrect, e.g..
           <br/>
           Walking on the road, a truck hit him.
           <br/>
           This sentence is wrong, because, we are not told who it was that was walking. As it is, it means that the truck was walking.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           7. In some cases, the usage permits use of participle without a proper subject of reference. Taking everything into consideration. I decided to move on.
           <br/>
           Frankly speaking. I want to go now.
          </p>
          <p>
           8. Sometimes, the participle is understood. Pistol in hand, he rushed towards the door.
           <br/>
           Here ‘being’ is understood between ‘pistol’ and ‘in’.
          </p>
