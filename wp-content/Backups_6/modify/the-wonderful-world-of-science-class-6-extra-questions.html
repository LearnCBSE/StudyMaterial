          <p>
           Question 6.
           <br/>
           Explain the scientific method using the example of a pen that stops writing.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Scientific Method and Pen Example: When a pen stops writing, the scientific method involves observing the problem, asking why it happened, guessing possible reasons (hypotheses), and testing these guesses. For instance, one might guess that the ink is finished and check the refill. If the ink Ts not finished, another guess might be that the ink dried up. Testing this hypothesis could involve trying to unclog the pen. This step-by-step process of hypothesizing and testing is the essence of the scientific method.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           Observation and Experimentation: Observation and experimentation are fundamental components of the scientific method. Observation involves carefully noting and recording phenomena, while experimentation tests hypotheses through controlled and repeatable procedures. The passage illustrates this with the example of troubleshooting a pen or cooking mishaps, where careful observation leads to formulating hypotheses, and experimentation helps verify them. These steps are essential for drawing accurate conclusions and advancing scientific knowledge.

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Why could we say that Science is everywhere around us?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Science is Everywhere Around Us: Science is omnipresent by highlighting its application in various aspects of daily life, from cooking and repairing bicycles to understanding natural phenomena and exploring outer space. Science helps explain the behaviour of water, the growth of plants, and the materials used in everyday objects. This pervasive presence of Science underscores its relevance and importance in understanding and improving our world.

           Question 11.
           <br/>
           What steps should one follow to find answers to scientific questions?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Steps to Find Scientific Answers: To find scientific answers, one should follow these steps: observe an interesting phenomenon, ask questions about it, formulate a hypothesis (a possible answer), test the hypothesis through experiments or further observations, and analyze the results to see if they support the hypothesis. This systematic approach helps in drawing accurate conclusions and building a body of scientific knowledge.
