           Question 1.
           <br/>
           What are ‘floes’, formed during secondary treatment of sewage ? (Delhi 2019)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Floes are masses of bacteria held together by slime and fungal filaments to form mesh-like structures. They are used during the secondary sewage treatment in the aeration tank to increase the rate of decomposition.

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Why do we add an inoculum of curd to milk for curdling it? (Delhi 2015C)
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Why is ‘starter’ added to set the milk into curd? Explain. (All India 2014C)
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Name the nutrient that gets enhanced while curdling of milk by Lactobacillus? (All India 2014C)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When a small amount of curd as starter or inoculum is added to fresh milk, millions of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) present in the starter grow in milk and convert it into curd. During this process, acids are produced by LAB that coagulate and partially digest the milk proteins (casein). LAB increase vitamin-B
           <sub>
            12
           </sub>
           content along with other vitamins in the curd.

          <p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           How is lactic acid bacteria beneficial to us other than helping in curdling the milk? (All India 2015C)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Two benefits of LAB are given below
          </p>

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker’s yeast) when added to dough causes its fermentation and releases CO
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           gas which is responsible for the puffed appearance of dough.

           Question 8.
           <br/>
           Mention the information that the health workers derive by measuring BOD of a water body. (All India 2010)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Biological Oxygen Demand or BOD value indicates the quantity of organic matter present in the water. Higher the BOD of water body, more is its polluting potential and vice-versa.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Why is sewage water treated until the BOD is reduced? Give a reason. (Delhi 2010C)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The higher the BOD of sewage water, more is its polluting potential. So, the sewage water is treated, till its BOD-is reduced which further indicates the reduction in the organic matter present in it.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Distinguish between the roles of flocks and anaerobic sludge digesters in sewage treatments. (Delhi 2016)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In sewage treatment, floes consume major part of the organic matter, converting it into microbial biomass and releasing lot of minerals.
           <br/>
           It reduces the BOD of sewage, while in anaerobic sludge digesters, many anaerobic bacteria are present, which digest the organic mass. During this digestion, methane, CO
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           etc. are produced.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 11.
           <br/>
           List the events that reduce the Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) of a primary effluent during sewage treatment. (Delhi 2016)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           To reduce the BOD of primary effluent during sewage treatment, it is passed into large aeration tanks with constant mechanical agitation and air supply. This allows vigorous growth of aerobic microbes into floes which consume major part of organic matter in the effluent. Hence, BOD of effluent is reduced.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 12.
           <br/>
           Explain the different steps involved during primary treatment phase of sewage. (All India 2015)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Primary treatment of sewage involves the physical removal of large and small particles from sewage through filtration and sedimentation.
           <br/>
           The steps involved in this process are
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Floating debris is removed by sequential filtration by passing through wire mesh screens.
           </li>
           <li>
            After this, the grit (soil and small pebbles) is removed by sedimentation in settling tanks. The sediment is called primary sludge and the supernatant forms the primary effluent.
           </li>
           <li>
            The effluent is then taken for the secondary treatment.

           Question 14.
           <br/>
           Bottled fruit juices are clearer as compared to those made at home. Explain. (Foreign 2015)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Bottled fruit juices are clearer as compared to those made at home because, in these juices pectinase enzyme is added, which digests the pectin and other fibres present in juices.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 15.
           <br/>
           Name two groups of organisms which constitute ‘floes’. Write their influence on the level of BOD during biological treatment of sewage. (All India 2014C)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The groups of organisms that constitute mesh-like structures called ‘floes’ are bacteria and fungi.
           <br/>
           These bacterial masses associated with fungal filaments called floes, consume the major part of organic matter present in effluent, thereby reducing the BOD of the waste significantly during biological or secondary treatment of sewage.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 16.

           Question 25.
           <br/>
           Secondary treatment of the sewage is also called biological treatment. Justify this statement and explain the process. (All India 2017)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The secondary treatment of sewage is also called biological treatment because in this treatment, sewage is subjected to biodegradation. It means that it involves the participation of microorganisms. The process of secondary treatment involves following steps
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Primary effluent is passed into large aeration tanks with constant mechanical agitation and air supply. This allows vigorous growth of useful aerobic microbes into floes (masses of bacteria and fungi filaments).
           </li>
           <li>
            These microbes consume major part of organic matter in the effluent, while growing. This reduces the BOD of the effluent.
           </li>
           <li>
            When BOD of sewage gets reduced, it is passed into settling tank. The bacterial floes settle in tank and the sediment is called activated sludge. A, small amount of activated sludge is pumped back into the aeration tank to serve as inoculum.
           </li>
           <li>
            The remaining major part of the sludge is pumped into large tanks called anaerobic sludge digesters, where other kinds of bacteria, which grow anaerobically, digest the bacteria and the fungi in the sludge.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           During this process, bacteria produce a mixture of gases, such as methane, hydrogen sulphide and the carbon dioxide, which form biogas. The effluent from secondary treatment is generally released into natural water bodies. It helps to reduce water pollution and water borne diseases.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 26.
           <br/>
           Describe how do ‘floes’ and ‘activated sludge’ help in sewage treatment. (Delhi 2017)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Roles of ‘floes’ and ‘activated sludge’ in sewage treatment are as follows
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Floes These are masses of bacteria held together by slime and fungal filaments to form mesh-like structures. These are used during the secondary sewage treatment in the aeration tank to increase the rate of decomposition.
           </li>
           <li>
            The microbes digest a lot of organic matter, converting it into microbial biomass and releasing a lot of minerals. As a result, BOD of the sewage reduces. As the BOD of waste is reduced to 10-15% of raw sewage, it is passed into settling tank. In these tanks, floes are allowed to undergo sedimentation.
           </li>
           <li>
            Activated sludge The sediment of settling tank is called’activated sludge. A part of it is used as inoculum in aeration tanks.
           </li>
           <li>
            The remaining part is passed into a large tank called anaerobic sludge digester. In these tanks, anaerobic microbes are present that digest the organic mass as well as aerobic microbes of activated sludge. The remaining sludge is used as manure or compost.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Question 27.
           <br/>
           Make a list of three household products along with the names of the microorganisms producing them. (All India 2016)
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Curd : Lactobacillus
           </li>
           <li>
            Bread : Saccharomyces cerevisiae
           </li>
           <li>
            Swiss cheese : Propionibacterium shermanii.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Question 28.
           <br/>
           Determination of Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) can help in suggesting the quality of a water body. Explain. (Delhi 2015)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           BOD is the amount of dissolved oxygen required for the microbial breakdown of biodegradable organic matter. Aerobic organisms use a lot of oxygen and as a result, there is a sharp decline in Dissolved Oxygen (DO) in the water body. This can cause death of fishes and other aquatic species.
          </p>
          <p>
           Determination of BOD is thus, an important parameter in determining the quality of a water body. The presence of more organic waste increases the microbial activity thus, decreasing the DO. BOD is higher in polluted water and lesser in clean water.

           <br/>
           The sequence of events occurring in a biogas plant are as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The biogas plant tank is fed with a slurry of dung.
           </li>
           <li>
            A floating cover is placed over the slurry, which keeps on rising as the gas is produced in the tank due to the microbial activity.
           </li>
           <li>
            Methanogens like Methanobacterium grows anaerobically on cellulosic plant material in cow dung to produce large amount of methane, CO

            </sub>
            .
           </li>
           <li>
            The plant has an outlet, which is connected by a pipe to supply biogas in nearby houses.
           </li>
           <li>
            The spent slurry is removed through another outlet and used as biofertilisers.
            <br/>
            A-Sludge tank
            <br/>
            B-Gas holder
            <br/>
            C-Dung water
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Question 62.
           <br/>
           (i) Why do farmers prefer biofertilisers to chemical fertilisers these days? Explain.
           <br/>
           (ii) How do Anabaena and mycorrhiza act as biofertilisers? (Delhi 2011)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) A farmer relies on biofertilisers then chemical fertilisers because
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Chemical fertilisers significantly increase the soil pollution and reduce quality of soil, cause water pollution, when it drains into nearby water bodies, after rain.
           </li>
           <li>
            Overuse of chemical fertiliser makes the soil unfit for raising any crop.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (ii) Anabaena fixes atmospheric nitrogen, thus enriching the nitrogen content of the soil, as well as the organic matter.
          </p>
          <p>
           In mycorrhiza, the fungal symbiont absorbs phosphorus from the soil and passes it to the plant and provides resistance to root borne diseases. Since, they fulfil the nitrogen and phosphorus requirement, they act as biofertilisers.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 63.
           <br/>
           Name the genus to which baculoviruses belong. Describe their role in the. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programme. (Delhi 2011; Foreign 2011)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Baculoviruses belong to the genus-Nucleopolyhedrovirus.
           <br/>
           Their role in IPM is as follows
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Baculoviruses are pathogens that attack insects and other arthropods.
           </li>
           <li>
            The majority of baculoviruses act as biocontrol agents.
           </li>
           <li>
            These viruses are excellent for species-specific, narrow spectrum insecticidal applications.
           </li>
           <li>
            They do not show negative impacts on plants, mammals, bird, fish or even non-target insects. Therefore, they play an important role as biocontrol agent.
           </li>
          </ul>

           Question 64.
           <br/>
           An organic farmer relies on natural predation for controlling pests and diseases. Justify by giving reasons, why this is considered to be a holistic approach? (Foreign 2010)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Organic farming is a holistic approach that seeks to develop an understanding of the webs of interaction among the myriads of organisms that form the flora and fauna of the field.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            An organic farmer works to create a system, where the insects are not eradicated, but kept at manageable level by a complex system of checks and balance within a living and vibrant ecosystem.
           </li>
           <li>
            Organic farming states that the eradication of pests is not only possible, but also undesirable, because many beneficial predatory and parasitic insects cannot survive without them.
           </li>
           <li>
            This use of biocontrol methods reduces the use of chemical pesticides and thereby pollution.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Question 65.
           <br/>
           What are biofertilisers? Describe their role in agriculture. Why are they preferred to chemical fertilisers? (Foreign 2015)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Biofertilisers are the living organisms that promote the growth of plants by replenishing the nutrients in the soil. These include bacteria, fungi and cyanobacteria.
          </p>
          <p>
           Role of Biofertlisers in Agriculture Some biofertilisers such as Rhizobium bacteria live in symbiotic association with plants. They live within the root nodules of leguminous plants. These bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen and enrich the nitrogen content of soil.
          </p>
          <p>
           Fungi such as Glomus forms symbiotic association with plants (mycorrhiza) by absorbing phosphorus and passing it to plants. Cyanobacteria such as Nostoc and Anabaena fix atmospheric nitrogen and act as biofertilisers especially in paddy fields.
          </p>
          <p>
           Biofertilisers are preferred over chemical fertilisers. Refer to Answer No. 26 (i).
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 66.

           <br/>
           (i) Statin
           <br/>
           (ii) Citric acid
           <br/>
           (iii) Penicillin
           <br/>
           (iv) Butyric acid
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Statin – Monascus purpureus
           <br/>
           (ii) Citric acid – Aspergillus niger
           <br/>
           (iii) Penicillin – Penicillium notatum
           <br/>
           (iv) Butyric acid – Clostridium butylicum
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 67.
           <br/>
           Choose any four microbes, from the following which are suited for organic farming which is in great demand these days for various reasons. Mention one application of each one chosen.
           <br/>
           Mycorrhiza, Monascus, Anabaena, Rhizobium, Methanobacterium, Trichoderma.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The four microbes that can be chosen for organic farming are
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Rhizobium The nodules on the roots of leguminous plants are formed by the symbiotic association of Rhizobium bacteria.
            <br/>
            These bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen into its organic form, which is used by the plants as nutrient.
           </li>
           <li>
            Mycorrhiza (Glomus) Many members of genus-Glomus form symbiotic association with plants called mycorrhiza. The fungal symbiont absorbs phosphorus from soil and passes it to the plant. Mycorrhiza shows resistance to root-borne pathogens, tolerance to salinity and drought and helps in overall increase in plant growth and development.
           </li>
           <li>
            Anabaena It is a cyanobacteria that is used as a biofertiliser. It fixes atmospheric nitrogen.
           </li>
           <li>
            Trichoderma It is a free-living fungi that is very common in the root ecosystems. It is a very effective biocontrol agent of several plant pathogens.
           </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
           Question 68.
           <br/>
           (i) How do organic farmers control pests? Give two examples.
           <br/>
           (ii) State the difference in their approach from that of conventional pest control methods.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) The organic farmers control pests by the use of insect pests resistant varieties. The two examples are
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The Pusa Gaurav variety of Brassica is resistant to aphids.
           </li>
           <li>
            Pusa Sawani variety of okra is resistant to shoot and fruit borer.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (ii) The use of resistant variety is safer to control the pests as it does not involve chemical pesticides which are used in conventional method of controlling pests. Thus, it is environmental friendly method and reduces soil pollution.
