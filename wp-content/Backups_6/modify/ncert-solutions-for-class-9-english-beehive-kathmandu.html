            II. Answer each question in a short paragraph.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           What difference does the author note between the flute seller and the other hawkers?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The author finds a difference in selling the articles. The flute seller does not shout out his wares. He makes a sale in a curiously offhanded way as if this was incidental to his enterprise.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           What is the belief at Pashupatinath about the end of Kaliyug?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           People believe that when a small shrine emerges fully on Bagwati river, the goddess inside will escape, and the evil period of the Kalyug will end on earth.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           The author has drawn powerful images and pictures. Pick out three examples each of
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            the atmosphere of ‘febrile confusion’ outside the temple of Pashupatinath (for example: some people trying to get the priest’s attention are elbowed aside…)
           </li>
           <li>
            the things he sees
           </li>
           <li>
            the sounds he hears
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           Answer:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            The author describes the monkey’s fight vividly and graphically. A fight breaks out between two monkeys. One chases the other, who jumps onto a shivalinga, then runs screaming around the temples and down to the river.
           </li>
           <li>
            The author observes a princess of the Nepalese royal house. Everyone bows to her. He sees monkeys. He sees felt bags, Tibetan prints and silver jewellery. He looks at flute sellers, hawkers of postcards, shops selling western cosmetics, etc.
           </li>
           <li>
            He hears film songs from the radios, car horns, bicycle bells, stray cows low and vendors shout out their wares. He also listens to the various flutes played by the flute seller.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           <strong>
            III. Answer the following questions in not more than 100-150 words each.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Compare and contrast the atmosphere in and around the Baudhnath shrine with the Pashupatinath temple.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           At Pashupatinath there is an atmosphere of ‘febrile confusion’. Priests, hawkers, devotees, tourists, cows, monkeys, pigeons and dogs roam through the grounds. There are so many worshippers that some people trying to get the priest’s attention are elbowed aside by others pushing their way to the front. At the Baudhnath stupa, the Buddhist shrine of Kathmandu, there is a sense of stillness. Its immense white dome is ringed by a road. Small shops stand on its outer edge. Most of the shops are owned by Tibetan immigrants. There are no crowds and this is a haven of quietness in the busy streets around.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           How does the author describe Kathmandu’s busiest streets?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The author says that Kathmandu is vivid, mercenary, religious, with small shrines to flower-adorned deities along the narrowest and busiest streets. There are fruit sellers, flute sellers, hawkers of postcards, shops selling western cosmetics, film rolls and chocolate or copper utensils and Nepalese antiques. Film songs blare out from the radios, car horns sound, bicycle bells ring, stray cows low, vendors shout out their wares. The author buys a com-on- the-cob roasted in a charcoal brazier on the pavement. He also buys coca cola and orange drink.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           “To hear any flute is to be drawn into the commonality of all mankind.” Why does the author say this?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The author says this because he is aware of the fact that music appeals to senses. It gives pleasure to every listener. The flute seller does not sell only one kind of flute. He has various types of flutes that represent different customs and culture. The flute seller is a wise sales person. He does not shout out his wares. He plays melodious tunes which fascinate others. Mankind does not have multiple appearances and shapes. It is universal and cosmopolitan. Music soothes everyone’s heart irrespective of their caste, colour and creed. So the author says that to hear any flute is to be drawn into the commonality of all mankind.

           Dear Diary,
          </p>
          <p>
           Today I feel pleasure to note down my experience to the visit to Pashupatinath Temple in Kathmandu with Vikram Seth. The visit was indeed exciting for me, though there was too much tumult at Pashupatinath Temple. I saw crowds of priests, hawkers, devotees, tourists at the temple. We offered a few flowers to God. Inside the temple I saw a large number of worshippers trying to get the priest’s attention and some of them were elbowed aside by others who were pushing their way to the front.
          </p>
          <p>
           Outside the temple, I saw a party of saffron- clad westeners struggle for permission to enter the temple. The policeman did not allow them to enter the temple because they were not Hindus.
          </p>
          <p>
           There is no doubt that the place is worth visiting. We feel aesthetic satisfaction by visiting such religious place.
           <br/>

            A Visit to Agra
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           It was January 2003.1 woke up before dawn and took the Shatabdi Express at 6.15 a.m. from Delhi bound for Agra. I met a newly married couple who belonged to Himachal Pradesh. We talked with one another and got off the train. I entered the once grand city, Agra. I saw the dense traffic, numerous rickshaw pullers, cars, people and vendors selling religious artifacts, plastic toys, spices and sweets. I went to the Taj Mahal which is one of the seven wonders of the world. It was entirely of white marble and had a magical quality of colour changing with varying of light and shadow. The white marble of Taj Mahal has gemstones of multi coloured engraved in it. The reflection of the Taj Mahal could be seen in the pond. There were many tourists, school children and tourist guides.
