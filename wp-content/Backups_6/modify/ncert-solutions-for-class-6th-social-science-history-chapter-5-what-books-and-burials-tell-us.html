            3. In what ways are the books we read today different from the Rigveda?
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Ans:
           </strong>
           The books we read today are written and printed. The Rigveda was recited and heard rather than read. For many years from generation to generation, the process continued. It was written down several centuries after it was first composed and printed less than 200 years ago.

            4. What kind of evidence from burials do archaeologists use to find out whether there were social differences amongst those who were buried?
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Ans:
            <br/>
           </strong>
           Sometimes, archaeologists find a circle of stone boulders or a single large stone standing on the ground. These are the only indications that there are burials beneath.
          </p>
          <p>
           All these burials have some common features. Generally, the dead were buried with distinctive pots, which are called Black and Red Ware. Also found are tools and weapons of iron and sometimes, skeleton of horses, horse equipment and ornaments of stone and gold.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           Several kinds of evidences from burials do archaeologists use to find out that there were social differences amongst those who were buried underneath the megaliths. They think that objects found with a skeleton probably belonged to the dead person. Sometimes more objects were found in one grave than in another. For instance in Brahmagiri, one skeleton was buried with 33 gold beads, 2 stone beads, 4 copper bangles and one conch shell. Other skeletons had only a few pots. Perhaps there were differences in status amongst the people who were buried. Perhaps some were rich, others poor, some chiefs, others followers.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            5. In what ways do you think that the life of a ‘raja’ was different from that of a ‘dasa’ or ‘dasi’?
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Ans:
           </strong>
           In the society, ‘raja’ was one of the highest civil positions. ‘Rajas’ were the kings of the community, whereas the ‘dasas’/’dasis’ were the lowest position in society. The ‘dasas’/’dasis’ were slaves who were used for work. They were treated as the property of their owners. They were captured in war.

            1. How have people in society been depicted in the Rigveda?    [V. Imp.]
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Ans:
           </strong>
           According to the Rigveda, there are two groups of people in terms of their work: (i) The priests, called Brahmins, and (ii) The ‘rajas’.
          </p>
          <p>
           The priests performed various vituals while the ‘rajas’ ruled. These rajas’ did not, however, have capital cities, palaces or armies, nor did they collect taxes. Two words were used to refer to the people of the community as a whole — those wo^ds were ‘jana’ and Vish’.
          </p>
          <p>
           The people who composed the hymns referred to themselves using the word ‘Aryas’ and called their opponents ‘Dasas’ or ‘Dasyus’, The ‘dasas’ were later slaves and were treated as the property of their owners.
