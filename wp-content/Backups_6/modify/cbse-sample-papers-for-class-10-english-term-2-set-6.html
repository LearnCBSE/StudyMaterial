           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below.
           <br/>
           Once upon a time, there lived a young boy named Sammy. He was good at studies, obedient towards his elders, more hardworking than a lot of other boys in his class and kind to everyone. Grown-ups as well as those younger than Sammy loved him very much. This aroused jealousy in some boys who longed to be as loved as him. A boy named Timmy studied in the same class as Sammy.
          </p>
          <p>
           5. Unlike Sammy, he was not good at studies and always liked to play during school hours. He misbehaved with his parents, bullied his classmates and even ill-treated Sammy. He always tried to put Sammy down and belittled him before the other kids in class. But no matter what he did, Sammy’s grades kept getting bette. Whether in studies or in sports, Sammy kept getting accolades from everywhere. On his eighth birthday, Sammy got a beautiful pen as a gift from his parents.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           10. He brought it to the school so that he could use it to take down the notes of the lectures that the teachers gave in class. When Timmy saw it, he felt jealous.
           <br/>
           He asked Sammy, “Hey, where did you get that? Did you buy it?” “My parents gave it as a birthday gift to me,” replied Sammy. Timmy was overcome with anger and jealousy. The bad boy that he was, rarely got any presents from his parents. He decided to steal Sammy’s pen.
          </p>
          <p>
           15. During recess, when everyone had gone out from the class, Timmy opened Sammy’s bag and took out his pen. Then he hid it inside his bag and went out to have his lunch. When Sammy came back and could not find his pen, he informed his class teacher about it. The class teacher ordered the class monitor to check every student’s bag. The missing pen was soon found from Timmy’s bag and the furious teacher asked the errant boy, “Now Timmy, what do you have to say about this?” 20. Timmy was in tears. He had nothing to say. When Sammy saw Timmy cry, he felt pity on the boy. The kind boy that he was, Sammy had no ill-feeling against his classmate. He requested his class teacher not to take any action against Timmy, now that his stolen pen was found.
           <br/>
           On the basis of your understanding of the passage, answer ANY FIVE questions from the following. (1 × 5)
           <br/>
           (A) What do you infer about Sammy in the following context, “He requested his class teacher not to take any action against Timmy, now that his stolen pen was found.” (1)
           <br/>
           (B) Rewrite the following sentence by replacing the underlined phrase with a word that means the same from lines 1-10.
           <br/>
           The wonders of nature always cause to increase my feelings towards the secret behind them. (1)
           <br/>
           (C) State any two reasons behind Timmy’s action of stealing. (1)
           <br/>
           (D) Why do you think Sammy forgave Timmy? (1)
           <br/>
           (E) List one likely impact of Sammy’s kind behaviour towards Timmy. (1)
           <br/>
           (F) Which of these quotes best justifies the central idea of the passage? Give reason.
           <br/>
           (i) Surely it is much more generous to forgive and remember, than to forgive and forget.
           <br/>
           (ii) A misbehaving child is a discouraged child. (1)

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Read the following excerpt from a case study titled ‘Challenges of Remote Teaching’.
           <br/>
           The rapid shift to e-learning, prompted by the pandemic, has exposed long-standing issues of inequality and a digital divide in India that must be addressed by future economic, education and digitalization policies. While the government endorses India as the flag-bearer of the digital revolution and acknowledges that it is a diverse and multilingual country, e-learning platforms

          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

          <p>
           5. cannot replicate the various dialects, varied contexts and different lived experiences that are brought together by physical classrooms. If e-learning is to be the ‘new normal’, the NEP and related policies must go further to address the feasibility of digitalization to ensure equity and quality in education. The potential scope of e-learning is enormous and can help realize the potential of each student, but e-learning offers both opportunities and challenges for the

          <p>
           10. government and the private sector. The aim should be to ensure equal and adequate access to such platforms as the country continues to globalize and catch up with advanced economies. If the Indian education system aims to transit to blended education with more online learning in future, it must emphasize policies that bridge the digital divide and move the country closer to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. In reality, the majority of government
          </p>
          <p>
           15. schoolteachers and students currently lack the tools and infrastructure to be a part of this digitalization process – unless these core shortcomings are addressed, educational inequalities will continue to widen. These sentiments are echoed by other key actors in the education sector, such as the CEO of Azim Premji Foundation. In an interview with the BBC, he said, “The education of children cannot be done effectively online and to do so would damage education

          <p>
           20. deeply and exacerbate inequities. Most disadvantaged children,” he added, “did not have “any support to handle online education at home and are in families combating deep livelihood crises, making them unable to cope with other challenges.” One critical factor as countries move towards using more technology to complement classroom-based learning (or as an alternative to face-to-face teaching) is the capacity of the teachers.

           25. teachers must be reduced, and they must be prepared, consulted and situated within an enabling ecosystem to lead this process. Students, teachers and parents are still getting used to the switch from learning in classrooms to learning from home. For the teachers, the move from interacting with a classroom 30. of around 40 students to trying to teach from their homes via mobile phones or laptops has been a learning experience fraught with challenges. From coping with the basics of internet connectivity and India’s notoriously unreliable power supply to more structural issues such as curriculum and teaching methods, educators have come under tremendous stress since India’s schools began shutting down.
