         <br/>
<strong>
          OR
         </strong>
<br/>
         The amount of data that can be transmitted in a fixed amount of time is known as bandwidth. For digital devices, the bandwidth is usually expressed in bits per second (bps) or bytes per second. For analog devices, the bandwidth is expressed in cycles per second, or Hertz (Hz).

          Switch is a device used to segment network into different sub-networks so switch will exist in all the blocks. Since distance between BLOCK-D and BLOCK-C is large so repeater will be install between BLOCK-D and BLOCK-C.

          The most economic way to connect it with a reasonable high speed would be the use radiowave transmission, as they are easy to install, can travel long distance and penetrate buildings easily, so they are used for communication, both indoors and outdoors. Radiowaves also have the advantage of being omni-directional. They can travel in all the directions from the source, so that the transmitter and receiver do not have to be carefully aligned physically.

           Answer:

</span>
<br/>
         The first benefit of XML is that because you are writing your own markup language, you are not restricted to a limited set of tags defined by proprietary vendors.
         <br/>
         Rather than waiting for standards bodies to adopt tag set enhancements (a process which can take quite some time), or for browser companies to adopt each other’s standards with XML, you can create your own set of tags at your own place.

         A firewall is a part of a computer system or network, that is designed to block unauthorized access while permitting authorized communi-cations. It is a device or set of devices configured to permit, deny, encrypt, decrypt, or proxy all (in and out) computer traffic between different security domains based upon a set of rules and, other criteria. 1

<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
           Answer:
          </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<strong>
          Freeware,
         </strong>
         the name derived from the words “free” and “software”. It is a computer software that is available for use at no cost or for an optional fee. Freeware is generally proprietary software available at zero price, and is not free software. The author usually restricts one or more rights to copy, distribute, and make derivative works of the software.
         <br/>
         Shareware is usually offered as a trial version with certain features only available after the license is purchased, or as a full version, but for a trial period. Once the trial period has passed, the program may stop running until a license is purchased. Shareware is often offered without support, updates, or help menus, which only become available with the purchase of a license. The words “free trial” or “trial version” are indicative of shareware.

<br/>
         A trojan horse is a term used to describe malware that appears to the user, to perform a desirable function but, in fact, facilitates unauthorized access, to the user’s computer system.
         <br/>
         A computer worm is a self-replicating computer program. It uses a network to send copies of itself to the other nodes (computers on the network) and it may do so without any user intervention.

         What is the difference between trojan horse and virus in terms of computers ?
         <br/>

           Answer:
          </strong>
</span>
<br/>
         A trojan, sometimes referred to as a trojan horse, is non-self-replicating malware that appears to perform a desirable function for the user but instead facilitates unauthorized access to the user’s computer system. The term is derived from the trojan horse story in greek mythology.
         <br/>
         A computer virus is a computer program that can copy itself and infact a computer. A true virus can only spread from one computer to another.
         <br/>
         The chief difference between a trojan horse and a virus is that a trojan horse does not replicate itself. A virus does. 1
