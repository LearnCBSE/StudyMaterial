           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below carefully: [8]
           <br/>
           Generally, it is the lionesses that do the work of hunting for food. They work together in the most remarkable way. A typical hunt involves some members of the pride stalking and driving a herd of grazing animals towards other lionesses lying in ambush. At the last moment the ambush party break cover and bring down one or two selected members of the herd. The main prey animals include wildbeast, zebra, impala, waterbuck, kudu and buffalo. Other big cats include the leopard, races of ’ which are found in both Africa and Asia. Leopards are good tree climbers and they often ambush prey by lying in wait on trees. Dark-haired leopards are known as panthers. The jaguar is the only big cat found in the America. It was once widespread, but it no longer exists in North America and is in danger of becoming extinct in South America. It feeds mainly on peccaries and other small animals.

          <p>
           The cheetah is also usually included among the big cats, as it rests with its feet held out in front (smaller cats tuck their front feet underneath them). However, it cannot roar and, unlike any other cats, it cannot retract its claws. It is therefore placed in a different genus to the other big cats. The cheetah is a very fast runner, but it has no power of endurance. It stalks a prey animal and then rushes at it from a few metres away. If it does not catch its intended victim within about 400 m (440 yds), it has to give up. The cat family includes a number of smaller species. Among these are the rare snow leopard of Southeast Asia, the manul of Central Asia, the European lynx, the bobcat , and puma of North America, the caracal and
           <br/>
           serval of Africa and the ocelot and pampas cat of South America.
          </p>
          <p>
           The domestic cat belongs to the genus Felis. It was almost certainly bred from the African bust cat, rather than the ferocious, tabby-life wild cat of Europe. Other members of this genus include the jungle cat of southeat Asia, the sand cat of Africa, the rare African golden cat and the endangered Geoffrey’s cat of South America. One of the largest is the beautiful Temminck’s golden cat of southeast Asia \which measures over 1 m (3 ft) in length.
           <br/>

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow : [12]
           <br/>
           This is a pivotal moment for India, for reasons that are not always obvious. Let me start with demographics. Already the world’s largest democracy and one of its most diverse countries, India is set to overtake China as the most populous nation. At the same time, India’s population is relatively young. Because education has the power to transform society, India’s youthfulness leaves it poised for an educational leap, at the very time education is being transformed by access and technology.

          <p>
           We use new ways to employ technology to enhance teaching and life-long learning. This is not about video-taped lectures posted online; this is a feedback loop of deep congitive research and practical application of a new kind of interactive learning. The focus is not on the tools, but on the outcomes for each student. The resulting teachniques have proven to the faster and more effective than traditional classroom curricula in a variety of subjects.
          </p>
          <p>
           At the same time, these techniques can create new access to learning at relatively little cost. Closely connected to research in artificial intelligence and machine learning, the technology-enhanced learning techniques being refined in laboratories at various universities, could fuel a dramatic transformation of education in India. Technology can be a powerful equaliser, levelling the playing field for millions of people in a short time. When technology is- changing quickly, developing countries have an opportunity to leapfrog existing standards, going directly to newer, better tools and methods. Think of the cell phone, which rapidly proliferated in India and other developing nations that were not deeply inversted in landlines. Now think of that technological leapfrogging in the field of education, the foundation for human success and new ideas that benefit society. The scholars are probing the intersection of technology and human possibility, and then translating their findings into practical application. These scholars are deeply grounded in the sciences and technologies they come to study, but also are increasingly adept at innovation and independent problem-solving that leads to new inventions, new companies and whole new fields.
           <br/>
           (a) What are the benefits of having young population in India? [2 × 4 = 8]
           <br/>
           (b) How is technology used for lifelong learning?
           <br/>
           (c) How are the new techniques different from traditional classroom?
           <br/>
           (d) How are the scholars trying to help in the field of education?

           Sub: Problem Of Stray Animals On Road
           <br/>
           Sir,
           <br/>
           Through the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I wish to draw the attention of the Municipal Corporation towards the problem to stray animals which are a constant threat to vehicles on the road. Sometimes these stray animals start behaving in a strange manner all of a sudden which can jeopardize the lives of the passerby. MCD should open parks or provide some grassy areas where these animals can feed without causing any disturbance.
           <br/>
           MCD should also take care of the arrangement of water for these animals. People should be made aware that they should not feed the animals on the road. The should feed them at their designated places only.
           <br/>
           Hope these steps would solve the problem and save many lives of humans as well as that of animals.
           <br/>
           Thanking You Your truly,
           <br/>

           ‘GIRL CHILD’
           <br/>
           By x y z
           <br/>
           A girl Child is the most beautiful and extremely sensitive creation of the Almighty. But the irony is that this beautiful creation is not loved or liked by the society much. The girl child is considered a burden even before her birth and is ill-treated by her own parents.
           <br/>
           The parents hesitate to send their lovely daughters to schools for education, as they feel it is the wastage of time and money as at last, girls will only have to manage their houses. Though the girls are successful in all the spheres of life, our society is still not ready to accept them as equal citizens of the society.
           <br/>
           In this regard, the government has announced a number of schemes and policies to encourage girls to get higher education so that they can contribute to the society. It is high time we stop under¬estimating their calibre and talents because no country can prosper without half of its population. Girls should get the best education and best treatment at home for a better future.

           Radhika was very happy when she came to a new town with her parents. She got admission in a good school as she had secured very good marks. The first day when she came to school. She was very excited to meet her new friends but she was shocked to see that everyone started laughing at her dark skin and short height. Some girls started calling her by funny names. She felt bad that , even the teacher in the class did not scold them. She went inside the class and wanted to sit on a desk. Noboby offered her a desk. Finally, she went to the desk at the end of the room. She wanted to cry because she was missing her old friends of previous school who loved her so much. All the children played together. There was no such difference among the children.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           The parents of the young seagull were very wise. On seeing that their child was quite weak and scared and is afraid to fly, they, at once, decided to be strict with him. They warned him that they would not feed him anymore as he was a grown up seagull. He would starve to death if he did not fly. They tempted him by showing flesh and eating it in front of him but they did not offer it to him. Hunger provoked the young seagull to fly and ultimately, he made efforts and was successful.
           <br/>
           OR
