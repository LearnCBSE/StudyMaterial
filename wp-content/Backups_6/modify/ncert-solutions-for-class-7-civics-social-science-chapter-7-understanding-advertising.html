            Answer:

           I don’t think there is any problem. Mother is undoubtedly the only person in the family who takes the greatest care of her child.

            Answer:
           </strong>
           (a) Here are two social advertisements. In the first advertisement the target audience is the disabled children. In the next advertisement the target audience is common mass.
           <br/>
           (b) Freedom is birthright to the disabled children also. Unless they get education, this freedom won’t come to them. Hence, they have every right to get education.

            Answer:
           </strong>
           Yes, the two ways in which we think advertising affects issues of equality in a democracy are:
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <ol>
           <li>
            The branded products are costly than those available in the open market because they include the cost of the product, its package, and its advertisement. Those people buy this product who can afford it. But there are numerous people who can not buy them because of the higher cost. Hence, the principle of equality is marred.
           </li>
           <li>
            Only large companies can get their products branded due to the large involvement of amounts of money. Small companies cannot get their product branded as they are not able to spend large amounts of money. Hence, there is a question of inequality in branding.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           <strong>
            6. Making an advertisement requires a lot of creativity. Let us imagine a situation in which a manufacturer has just made a new watch. She says that she wants to sell this watch to school children. She comes to your class and asks you all to create a brand name as well as an advertisement for the watch. Divide the class into small groups and each group creates an advertisement for this watch. Share it with the class.

           Sometimes there are two or more advertisements of a similar product. This makes the consumer confused because it becomes difficult for him to differentiate one product from the other/others.

           <strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Daals (pulses) are usually sold loose in the market. There are different types of daals in the market such as arahar ki daal, masoor ki dual, urad ki daal, etc. These names are not brand names. When a company takes particular daal such as urad ki daal and puts it into a packet, it will need to give the daal a specific name. It needs to do this so that we don’t confuse the daal is that particular packet with the daal that is sold loose.

            Answer:
           </strong>
           In such a situation the consumer is confused. He cannot decide which product he should buy. The manufacturer, being aware of this has to give the consumer a reason to refer a particular brand of a product. Just naming a product does not help sell it. So, advertisers began claiming certain special values for their brand. In this way, they try to differentiate it from other similar products.

           The two daals namely Top Taste Daal’ and ‘Best Taste Daal’ are saying two different things. Top Taste Daal is appealing to our social tradition of treating guests extremely well. On the other hand ‘Best Taste Daal is appealing to our concern for our children’s health and that they eat things that are good for them. Values such as treating our guests well and making sure and children get nutritious food are used by brands to create brand values. These brand values are conveyed through the use of visuals and words to give us an overall image that appeals to us.

           <strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           The Care Soap advertisement uses the mother’s concern for her child. It tells the mother that her love and care is best shown through using this particular brand of soap. Because of this, mothers begin to feel that using this soap is a sign of how much they love their child. In this way, the advertisement uses the love of a mother for her child to sell this expensive soap.
           <br/>
           Just think about those mothers who cannot afford this soap. They might begin to feel that they are not giving their children the best care.

            Answer:
           </strong>
           Advertisements play a major role in our lives. They influence us to a great extent. We watch advertisements, discuss them, and often judge people according to the brand products they use. Whenever we see cricket heroes and film stars advertising different products we feel tempted to buy those products. It is because persons whom we consider our heroes tell us that they are worth buying.
          </p>
          <p>
           Advertisements tell us how we should live our lives, what we should aspire and dream for, how we should express our love, what it means to be smart, successful, and beautiful. Thus, advertisements have a significant role in our lives. In the present scenario, we cannot think of life without advertisements.

           <strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Advertising a product is a costly affair no doubt but this is the only way to sell products in the market. Large companies have no dearth to money and therefore they can easily advertise their products. But these are small businessmen also who have no money to show their products on television or national newspapers and magazines. They often have to sell their products in weekly markets and neighbourhood shops.
          </p>
          <p>
           Advertising also makes us believe that packaged and branded things are better than things sold loose. We often forget that the quality of a product has little to do with the packaging that it comes in. This shift to packaged products negatively affects the sales of several small businesses forcing people out of their livelihoods.

           <strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Advertising shows certain drawbacks which are as follow:
           <br/>
           (a) We are citizens of a democratic country. It means we all are equal. But advertising always focuses on the lives of the rich and influential persons. It tends to promote a certain lack of respect for the poor. They are not the faces we most often see in advertisements and therefore we cease to think about them.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Advertising uses the personal emotions of the people. Those who are capable to buy certain brands feel exalted but there are many who cannot afford to buy them. The personal emotions of these people are hurt badly.
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) Advertising promotes the sale of packaged products. This negatively affects the sale of things which do not come in packets. This forces many people out of their livelihoods.
          </p>
          <p>
           (d) Advertising by focussing on the lives of the rich and famous helps us forget about issues of poverty, discrimination, and dignity, all of which are central to the functioning of equality in a democracy.
