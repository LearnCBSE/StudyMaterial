           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Write the main functions of the following :
           <br/>
           (a) sensory neuron
           <br/>
           (b) cranium
           <br/>
           (c) vertebral column
           <br/>
           (d) motor neuron. (Board Term I, 2017)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Sensory neuron occur in sense organs and receive stimuli through their dendrites. The sensory neurons transmit impulses towards the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) with the help of their axons.
           <br/>
           (b) Cranium : The bones of cranium or brain box protect the brain from mechanical injury.
           <br/>
           (c) Vertebral column : Major function of the vertebral column is protection of the spinal cord and carries the weight of the upper body.
           <br/>
           (d) Motor neuron: The dendrites of these neurons synapse with axons of interneurons in central nervous system. They transmit impulses from central nervous system towards effectors (muscles or glands). The latter respond to stimuli.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Why does the flow of signals in a synapse from axonal end of one neuron to dendritic end of another neuron take place but not in the reverse direction? Explain. (AI 2019)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           At the synapse, (functional junction between neurons) axon terminal comes in close proximity to the dendron terminal of next neuron. Axon terminal is expanded to form pre-synaptic knob and the other dendrite terminal forms post- synaptic depression.
          </p>
          <p>
           In between the two, lies a narrow fluid filled space called synaptic cleft. As the nerve impulse reaches the pre-synaptic knob, the synaptic vesicles get stimulated to release neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitter molecules diffuse across the gap to come in contact with post-synaptic membrane. In this way, nerve impulse passes across the minute gap to stimulate dendron of other neuron. The synapse acts as a one-way valve to conduct impulse in one direction only. This is so because chemical substance called neurotransmitter is secreted only on one side of the gap, i.e., on axon’s side. It carries impulse across the synapse and passes it to the dendron of the other neuron. In this way, impulses travel across the neurons only in one direction, i.e., from axon of one neuron to dendron of other neuron through a synapse.

          <p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           “Reflex arcs continue to be more efficient for quick responses”. Justify this statement giving reason. (Board Term I, 2017)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Reflex action is an automatic and spontaneous response to a stimulus. The pathway taken by nerve impulses and responses in a reflex action is called a reflex arc. It consists of receptor, sensory nerve (afferent), spinal cord, motor nerve (efferent) and effector (muscles or glands). Reflex arc is evolved in animals because the thinking process of the brain is not fast enough. Reflex arc enables the body to give quick responses to harmful stimuli so that chances of damage to body are decreased. It also prevents overloading of brain, so prevents its fatigue. Many animals have very little or none of the complex neuron network needed for thinking. So, it is likely that reflex arc has evolved as an efficient way of functioning in the absence of true thought processes. However, even after complex neuron networks have came into existence, reflex arcs continue to be more efficient for quick responses.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 6.
           <br/>
           (a) Define reflex arc.
           <br/>
           (b) Trace the sequence of events which occur in our body when a bright light is focussed on your eyes. (Board Term I, 2016)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The pathway taken by the nerve impulses in a reflex action, from receptor organ to spinal cord and back to effector organ of reflex action is called reflex arc. Receptor organ could be a sense organ such as eyes, skin, etc., and effector organ could be muscles, glands, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) When a bright light is focussed on eye, receptor cell receives the stimulus and an impulse is generated. This impulse is passed on to sensory neuron, then it goes to brain, brain sends the impulse to the motor neuron which contracts the pupil. Sequence of events can be summarised as : Photoreceptors in eye → Sensory (Receptor) neuron → Brain → Motor (Effector) neuron → Eye muscle → Constriction of pupils

          </p>
          <p>
           (b) (i) Forebrain which includes cerebrum, olfactory lobes and diencephalon, is the main thinking part of the brain.
           <br/>
           (ii) Cerebellum, part of hindbrain is responsible for maintaining the posture and balance of the body.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 8.
           <br/>
           Mentioh three major regions of brain. Write one function of each. (Board Term I, 2014)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Brain is divided into three main regions forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain.
           <br/>
           (i) Forebrain consists of cerebrum, olfactory lobes and diencephalon. Its main function is thinking and controlling various activities such as touch, smell, hearing, speech and sight.
           <br/>
           (ii) Midbrain controls reflex movements of the head, neck and trunk in response to visual and auditory stimuli.
           <br/>
           (iii) Hindbrain has three centres called pons, cerebellum and medulla. This part is responsible for regulating respiration, maintaining posture and balance of body and controlling involuntary actions such as heartbeat, breathing, swallowing, coughing, sneezing, vomiting, etc.
          </p>

           Question 9.
           <br/>
           State one example of chemotropism. (Board Term I, 2015)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Growth of pollen tube towards the ovule due to chemical stimulus during the process of fertilisation in a flower is an example of chemotropism.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 10.
           <br/>
           What is meant by tropic movements? (Board Term I, 2013)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Directional movements or orientations of specific part of a plant in response to external stimuli are called tropisms or tropic movements.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           Question 11.
           <br/>
           State the two types of movements seen in plants. Give one example of each type. (Board Term I, 2016)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Two types of movements seen in plants are:
           <br/>
           (i) Nastic movements are movements independent of growth that are non-direclional and occur due to turgor changes, e.g., closing of leaves in response to touch stimulus in ‘touch me not’ plant.
           <br/>
           (ii) Tropic movements or tropism are movements due to growth, that are directional and very slow, e.g., movement of a part of the plant in response to light.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 12.
           <br/>
           Define geotropism. Draw a labelled diagram of a plant showing geotropic movement of its parts. (2020)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Geotropism refers to the upward and downward growth of shoots and roots respectively in response to the pull of earth or gravity. If the plant part moves in the direction of gravity, it is called positive geotropism. Likewise, if the plant part moves against the direction of gravity, it is termed as negative geotropism. Shoots are usually negatively geotropic and roots are usually positively geotropic. A well labelled diagram of plant showing geotropism is:

          </p>
          <p>
           Question 13.
           <br/>
           What are plant hormones? Name the plant hormones responsible for the following :
           <br/>
           (i) Growth of stem
           <br/>
           (ii) Promotion of cell division
           <br/>
           (iii) Inhibition of growth
           <br/>
           (iv) Elongation of cells (Delhi 2019)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Plant hormones or phytohormones are chemical substances produced naturally in plants and capable of translocation and regulating one or more physiological processes when present in low concentration. These are also known as plant growth substances or plant growth regulators.
          </p>
          <p>
           The plant hormones responsible for different functions are as follows:
           <br/>
           (i) Growth of stem : Gibberellins (Gibberellic acid) promote growth in stems.
           <br/>
           (ii) Promotion of cell division : Cytokinins promote cell division in plants.

           Question 14.
           <br/>
           Define phototropism. Name the plant hormone which is responsible for phototropism. (Board Term I, 2016)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Phototropism is the movement of a part of the plant in response to light. Shoots generally grow towards light and are said to be positively phototropic, while roots grow away from light and are said to be negatively phototropic.
           <br/>
           The growth movement of the plant part (stem) is caused by the action of auxin hormone. Auxin causes cell elongation. Thus, causing growth of stem towards the light stimulus.

           (b) What happens when a growing plant detects light? Explain in brief. (Board Term I, 2017)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Phytohormones are chemical substances produced naturally in plants and are capable of translocation and regulating one or more physiological processes when present in low concentration. Plant hormones help to coordinate growth, development and responses to the environment. Plant hormones are also known as plant growth substances or plant growth regulators.
           <br/>
           Types of hormone and their site of synthesis are as follows:

           (b) Plants respond to light by showing growth movement towards light (phototropism). This growth movement of the plant part (stem) is caused by the action of auxin hormone. The auxin hormone is synthesised in the meristematic tissue at the tip of the stem. Auxin diffuses uniformly down the stem in plants that are kept in the open and receive sunlight from above. Due to presence of auxin equally on both the sides, the stem grows up straight because both the sides of the stem show growth at the same place. But when sunlight is unidirectional, auxin- gets accumulated towards the shady region of (he shoot. This causes the cells to elongate and stem to bend towards light.

           Answer question numbers 18 to 21 on the basis of your understanding of the following information and related studied concepts :
           <br/>
           Thyroid gland is a bilobed structure situated in our neck region. It secretes a hormone called thyroxine. Iodine is necessary for the thyroid gland to make thyroxine. Thyroxine regulates carbohydrates, protein and fat metabolism in the body. It promotes growth of body tissues also. When there is an excess of thyroxine in the body, a person suffers from hyperthyroidism and if this gland is underactive it results in hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism is diagnosed by blood tests that measure the levels of thyroxine and Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH). Hypothyroidism is caused due to the deficiency of iodine in our diet resulting in a disease called goitre. Iod;sed salt can be included in our diet to control it.

           Women are at greater risk for developing abnormal TSH levels during menstruation, while giving birth and after going through menopause. Around 5% of women in the United States have some kind of thyroid problem compared to 3% of men. Despite claims that high TSH increases your risk for heart disease, a 2013 study found no link between high TSH and heart diseases. But a 2017 study showed that older women are especially at risk for developing thyroid cancer if they have high TSH levels along with thyroid nodules.

           A squirrel is in a scary situation. Its body has to prepare for either fighting or running away. State the immediate changes that take place in its body so that the squirrel is able to either fight or run. (2020)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When squirrel is in a scary situation then its nervous system stimulates the adrenal glands to secrete more adrenaline hormone into blood.
          </p>
          <p>
           This adrenaline hormone increases heartbeat, breathing rate, blood flow into muscles and causes liver to put more stored glucose into its blood. All these actions of adrenaline hormone produces a lot of energy in squirrel’s body. In this way, squirrel prepares itself for fighting or running away action.

           Question 31.
           <br/>
           Why is chemical communication better than electrical impulses as a means of communication between cells in a multicellular organisms? (2020)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In animals, the message communicated in the form of nerve impulses, from receptors to central nervous system and from latter to effectors is very quick. But nerve impulses can reach only those animal cells which are connected by the nervous tissue. These cells after generation and transmission of nerve impulses, take sometime to reset their mechanism before a new impulse is generated and transmitted. It means, cells cannot continuously generate and transmit electrical impulses. This is the reason most multicellular organisms use another means of communication called chemical communication. In chemical communication information spreads out throughout the body by blood and its effects lasts longer. Chemical communication is however slow but it can reach all the cells of body regardless of nervous connections.

           Question 32.

           A cheetah, on seeing a prey moves towards him at a very high speed. What causes the movement of his muscles? How does the chemistry of cellular components of muscles change during this event? (2020)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The cheetah senses its prey by photoreceptors and the information is sent to the central nervous system. The response is then carried by neurons. Along with nervous system, the hormonal system also plays a role. Adrenaline hormone produced by the adrenal glands triggers the flight or fight action. On seeing a prey, these hormones are released into the cheetahs blood stream. It speeds up heartbeat, breathing increases blood flow into leg muscles and causes liver to put more stored glucose into cheetahs blood. All these actions of adrenline hormone produces a lot of energy which helps cheetah to run fast.

           Question 40.
           <br/>
           (a) Name one organ each where growth hormone is synthesised in man and plant.
           <br/>
           (b) List the sequence of events that occur when a plant is exposed to unidirectional light, leading to bending of a growing shoot. Also name the hormone and the type of movement. (Board Term I, 2014)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) In man, growth hormone is synthesised by pituitary gland which is present below the brain. Growth hormone controls the growth of human body.
           <br/>
           In plants, auxins promote the plant growth. Auxins are produced by growing apices of the stems and roots. They migrate to the regions of their action, and initiate cell division and cell elongation.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) (i) When a plant is exposed to unidirectional light, the shoot tips synthesise phytohormone called auxin.
           <br/>
           (ii) Auxins slowly diffuse towards the shady side.
           <br/>
           (iii) As auxins help the plant to grow, cells on the shady side grow longer than the ones which are exposed to light.
           <br/>
           (iv) Hence, causing the plant to bend towards light. This type of movement caused due to hormone auxin is called phototropism.
           <br/>
           Shoots generally grow towards the light hence show positive phototropism and roots grow away from light and show negative phototropism.

           42.State how concentration of auxin stimulates the cells to grow longer on the side of the shoot which is away from light ?
           <br/>
           Answer. When light falls on the side of the shoot auxin diffuses towards the shady side of the shoot. This concentration of the auxin stimulates the cell to grow longer on the side of the shoot which is away from light. Thus plant appears to bend towards light.

           43. What is synapse ? In a neuron cell how is an electrical impulse created and what is the role of synapse in this context ?
           <br/>
           Answer. A synapse is the gap between the two neurons. Here the axon terminal of one neuron is in close proximity to the dendrite of the second neuron. When a nerve impulse reaches the knob like nerve ending of an axon, a tiny amount of a chemical substance is released in the synapse. This chemical substance is called as the neurotransmitter. At synapse the electrical signals converted into chemicals, that can easily cross over the gap and pass on to the next neurons where it again converted into electrical signals.

           47.(a) Name the hormone which is released into the blood when its sugar level rises. Explain the need of Chemical communication in multicellular organisms the organ which produces this hormone and its effect on blood sugar level. Also mention the digestive enzymes secreted by this organ with one function of each.
           <br/>
           (b) Explain the need of Chemical communication in multicellular organisms.
           <br/>
           Answer.
           <br/>
           (a) Glucose is needed by cells for respiration. It is important that the concentration of glucose in the blood is maintained at a constant level. Insulin is a hormone produced by the a-cells that regulates glucose levels in the blood.
           <br/>
           In order for multicellular organisms to function properly, their cells must communicate. For instance, your muscles must contract when your brain sends a message to contract.
           <br/>
           Pancreas produces insulin and p-cells which increase glucose in blood. It also – produces digestive enzyme (pancreatic amylase).
           <br/>
           (b) Cell-to-cell signaling is a critical component of coordinating cellular activities. Through this communication, messages are carried from signaling cells to receiving cells, also known as target cells. This signaling occurs with proteins and other types of signaling molecules. Other things which happens in our body due to cell communication are – growth and development, cellular reproduction, tissue repair, sensing pain, etc.

           53.State the functions of plant hormones. Name four different types of plant hormones.
           <br/>
           Answer. Plant hormones help to coordinate growth, development and responses in environment.
           <br/>
           Four different types of plant hormones are – Auxins, Gibberellins, Cytokinins, Ethylene and Abscisic acid.
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Auxins control the tropic (growth related) movements of the plants in response to light, gravity, touch etc by increasing the size of cells. Under the influence of auxins, the plant stem bends towards unidirectional light where as the roots bend away from it.
           </li>
           <li>
            Gibberellins stimulate stem elongation and leaf expansion. Its application causes stem elongation in small plants such as cabbage. Spraying gibberellins on sugarcane plant increases the stem size and hence the yield.
           </li>
           <li>
            Cytokinins are produced in regions of the plant body where rapid cell division occur, such as root tips, developing shoot buds, young fruits and seeds. Cytokinins promote growth by stimulating cell division. They also help in production of new leaves and chloroplasts in leaves.
           </li>
           <li>
            Ethylene causes ripening of the fruits.
           </li>
           <li>
            Abscisic acid inhibits (i.e., slows down) the growth in different parts of the plant body. It also inhibits germination of seeds. It increases the tolerance of plant to different kinds of stresses such as temperature changes. So, it is also called the stress hormone in plants. It also causes the drying and falling of older leaves, flowers and fruits.
           </li>
          </ol>

           <br/>
           (b) Name two main parts of hind brain and state the functions of each.
           <br/>
           Answer.
           <br/>
           (a) Brain is covered by a three layered membrane called meninges. In between the layers of meninges and brain, cavity fluid named Cerebro Spinal Fluid (CSF) is filled. The hard skull covers the meninges. Thus Meninges, CSF and Skull protects our brain for a certain extent.
           <br/>
           (b) Two main parts of hind-brain are — Medulla and Cerebellum. Their functions are:
           <br/>
           Medulla : Involuntary actions such as blood pressure, salivation and vomiting.
           <br/>
           Cerebellum : It is responsible for precision of voluntary actions and maintaining the posture and balance of the body.

           57.(a) Explain how auxins help in bending of plant stem towards light.
           <br/>
           (b) State the objective of the experiment for which experimental set-up is shown in the given diagram.
           <br/>
           Answer.
           <br/>
           (a) In plant shoots, the role of auxin is to cause a positive phototropism, i.e. to grow the plant towards the light. When light is incident on a plant from one direction, it causes the auxins to redistribute towards the shaded side of the plant. One function of auxin is to cause cell elongation. The redistribution causes the cells on the shaded side to elongate more than those on the side with the light shining on them. This causes the shoot to bend towards the light.
           <br/>
           (b) The objective of the experiment is to show phototropic movement of plant.

           <li>
            Sensory organ carries message in the form of sensory impulse to the spinal cord.
           </li>
           <li>
            The spinal cord acts as modulator : The neurons of spinal cord transmit the sensory nerve impulse to motor neuron.
           </li>
           <li>
            Motor never conducts these impulses to the effectors like leg muscles which responds by pulling back the organ away from the harmful stimulus.

           <br/>
           (b) What is the need for a system of control and coordination in human

           beings?
           <br/>
           Answer.(a) The two main constituents of the Central Nervous System in human beings are the brain and the spinal cord.
           <br/>
           (b) A living being does not live in isolation. It has to constantly interact with its external environment and has to respond properly for its survival. For example; when a hungry lion spots a deer, the lion has to quickly make a move so that it can have its food. On the other hand, the deer needs to quickly make a move to run for its life. The responses which a living being makes in relation to external stimuli are controlled and coordinated by a system; especially in complex animals. So, control and coordination . is essential in maintaining a state of stability and a steady state between the internal conditions of an organism and the external environment.
