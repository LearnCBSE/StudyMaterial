           What is the direction of electric field E at P and R?
           <br/>
           (a) At P, E is to the left and at R, E is upward
           <br/>
           (b) At P, E is to the right and at R, E is downward
           <br/>
           (c) At P, E is to downward and at R, E is to the left
           <br/>
           (d) At P, E is to upward and at R, E is to the right
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) At P, E is to the left and at R, E is upward
          </p>
          <p>
           Electric field lines are perpendicular to the equipotential surfaces and point in the direction of decreasing potential. So, at point P, electric field E is to the left and at point R, E is upward.

           (a) 1 and 3 both correspond to forward bias of junction
           <br/>
           (b) 3 corresponds to forward bias of junction and 1 corresponds to reverse bias of junction
           <br/>
           (c) 1 corresponds to forward bias and 3 corresponds to reverse bias of junction
           <br/>
           (d) 3 and 1 both correspond to reverse bias of junction
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (b) 3 corresponds to forward bias of junction and 1 corresponds to reverse bias of junction
          </p>
          <p>
           When p-n junction is forward biased, it opposes the potential barrier junction, when p-n junction is reverse biased, it supports the potential barrier junction, resulting in increase in potential barrier across the junction.
           <br/>
           So, 3 corresponds to forward bias of junction and 1 corresponds to reverse bias of junction.

           <br/>
           Assertion (A) If optical density of a substance is more than that of water, then the mass density of substance can be less than water.
           <br/>
           Reason (R) Optical density and mass density are not related. [1]

           (a) If both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A.
          </p>
          <p>
           Optical density and mass density are not related to each other. Mass density is mass per unit volume. Optical density is the ratio of the speed of light in two medium.

           Question 20.
           <br/>
           The focal length of a thin bi-convex lens is 20 cm. When an object is moved from a distance of 25 cm infront of it to 50 cm, the magnification of its image changes from m25 to m50. Find the ratio of m25/m50. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Since, magnification, m = \(\frac{f}{f+u}\)

          <p>
           m
           <sub>

           = \(\frac{25}{20-25}\) = -4

           Question 24.
           <br/>
           An electron, α-particle and a proton have the same de-Broglie wavelengths. Which of these particle has
           <br/>
           (i) minimum kinetic energy?
           <br/>
           (ii) maximum kinetic energy and why?
           <br/>
           In what way has the wave nature of electron beam exploited in electron microscope?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           According to de-Broglie matter wave equation,
           <br/>
           λ = \(\frac{h}{p}\) = \(\frac{h}{\sqrt{2 m k}}\)
           <br/>
           where, K is kinetic energy and m is mass of the particle.
           <br/>
           K = \(\frac{h^2}{2 m \lambda^2}\) [for same wavelength λ]
           <br/>
           ⇒ K ∝ \(\frac{1}{m}\)

           (i) α-particle possesses minimum kinetic energy.
           <br/>
           (ii) Electron has maximum kinetic energy.
           <br/>
           The magnifying power of an electron microscope is inversely related to wavelength of radiation used. Smaller wavelength of electron beam in comparison to visible light increases the magnifying power of microscope.

           Question 27.
           <br/>
           Draw V-I characteristics of a p-n junction diode. Answer the following questions giving reasons.
           <br/>
           (i) Why is the current under reverse bias almost independent of the applied potential upto a critical voltage? [1]
           <br/>
           (ii) Why does the reverse current show a sudden increase at the critical voltage? [1]
           <br/>
           (iii) Why energy is released, when a p-n junction diode is forward biased? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           V-I characteristics of p-n junction is shown below.
           <br/>
           <img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-156159" height="210" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-12-Physics-Set-8-with-Solutions-15.png" width="247"/>
           <br/>
           (i) Under the reverse bias condition, the holes of p-side are attracted towards the negative terminal of the battery and the electrons of the n-side are attracted towards the positive terminal of the battery. This increases the depletion layer and the induced potential barrier is also increased. However, the minority charge carriers are drifted across a junction producing a small current. At any temperature, a number of minority charge carriers is constant, so there is the small current at any applied potential. This is the reason for the current under reverse bias known as reverse saturation current which is almost independent of applied potential. At the certain level of voltage, avalanche breakdown takes place which results in a sudden flow of large current.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) At the critical voltage, the voltage at which breakdown takes place, the holes in the n-side and conduction electrons in the p-side are accelerated due to the reverse bias voltage. These minority carriers acquire sufficient kinetic energy from the electric field and collide with a valence electron. Thus, the bond is finally broken and the valence electrons move into the conduction band resulting in enormous flow of electrons and thus, formation of electron-hole pairs. Thus, there is a sudden increase in the current at the critical voltage.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) When p-n junction is forward biased, then energy released due to recombination of free electrons and holes.

           Questions 28.
           <br/>
           Would the Bohr’s formula for the H-atom remains unchanged, if proton had a charge (+4/3)e and electron had a charge (-3 /4)e, where e = 16 × 10
           <sup>
            -19
           </sup>
           C. Give reasons for your answer. [3]
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Positronium is just like a H-atom with proton replaced by the positively charged anti-particle of the electron (called the positron which is as massive as the electron). What would be the ground state energy of positronium? [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           According to Bohr’s theory, centripetal force required by the electron for its motion around the nucleus = Electric force between the proton and electron.
           <br/>
           ⇒ \(\frac{m v^2}{r}\) = \(\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0}\) ⋅ \(\frac{\left(q_p\right)\left(q_e\right)}{r^2}\)
           <br/>
           where, r = atomic radius,
           <br/>
           q
           <sub>
            p

            e
           </sub>
           = charge of electron = – e
           <br/>
           ⇒ \(\frac{m v^2}{r}\) = \(\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0}\) ⋅ \(\frac{(e)(-e)}{r^2}\)
           <br/>
           = \(\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0}\) ⋅ \(\frac{-e^2}{r^2}\)
           <br/>
           Now, given charge on proton, q
           <sub>
            p
           </sub>
           = + \(\frac{4}{3}\)e

           Charge on electron, q
           <sub>
            e
           </sub>
           = – \(\frac{3}{4}\)e
           <br/>
           Putting the new value (keeping after factors unchanged),
           <br/>
           \(\frac{m v^2}{r}\) = \(\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0}\)
           <br/>

           where signs are as usual but m is the reduced mass of electron and proton. Also, the total energy of the electron in the ground state of the hydrogen atom is -13.6 eV. For H-atom, reduced mass is m
           <sub>
            e

           whereas the positronium, the reduced mass is m = \(\frac{m_e}{2}\).
           <br/>
           Hence, the total energy of the electron in the ground state of the positronium atom is

           \(\frac{-13.6 \mathrm{eV}}{2}\) = -6.8eV.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Conductivity: The reciprocal of resistivity of a conductor is known as conductivity. It is expressed as
           <br/>
           σ = \(\frac{1}{ρ}\)
           <br/>
           The SI unit of conductivity is mho per metre (Ω
           <sup>
            -1
           </sup>
           -V

            -1
           </sup>
           ).
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The best conductor is silver because electrical conductivity is inversely proportional to the resistivity and resistivity of silver is least.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) The given situation is shown below.

           (i) A conductor of length l is connected to a DC source of potential V. If the length of the conductor is tripled by gradually stretching it, keeping V constant, how will

           (a) drift speed of electrons and
           <br/>
           (b) resistance of the conductor be affected? Justify your answer. [4]
           <br/>
           (ii) For wiring in the home, one uses Cu wires or Al wires. What considerations are involved in this? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) When a wire is stretched, then there is no change in the material of the wire, hence its volume remains constant.
           <br/>
           The potential V = constant, l’ = 3l
           <br/>
           (a)
           <br/>
           v oc \(\frac{1}{l}\) [∵ other factors are constants]
           <br/>
           So, when length is tripled, drift velocity gets one-third.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) ∵ Volume remains constant for conductor,
           <br/>
           V

            2
           </sub>
           (3l)
           <br/>
           [∵ length is tripled after stretching]
           <br/>
           ∴ A
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           = \(\frac{A_1}{3}\)
           <br/>
           i.e. When length is tripled, area of cross-section is reduced to \(\frac{A}{3}\).
           <br/>
           Hence, R = ρ \(\frac{l’}{A’}\) = ρ \(\frac{3l}{\frac{A}{3}}\) = 9ρ \(\frac{l}{A}\) = 9R
           <br/>
           Thus, new resistance will be 9 times of its original value.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The Cu wires or Al wires are used for wiring in the home.The main considerations involved in this process are cost of metal and good conductivity of metal.

           Question 32.
           <br/>
           (i) What are the different ways by which emf can be induced in a conductor? [2]
           <br/>
           (ii) Using Faraday’s law, derive the expression for motional emf induced in a straight conductor moving in a uniform magnetic field in a plane perpendicular to the direction of magnetic field. [2]
           <br/>
           (iii) How can we find the polarity of induced emf ? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Since, according to Faraday’s law, the emf induced in a conductor whenever magnetic flux through it changes is given by
           <br/>
           ε = -N \(\frac{d \phi}{d t}\)
           <br/>
           where, N = Number of turns of coil (conductor)
           <br/>
           and ϕ = flux through the conductor
           <br/>
           But ϕ = BA cos θ
           <br/>
           where, B = magnetic field,
           <br/>
           A = area of conductor
           <br/>
           and θ = angle between B and A (Area vector).
           <br/>
           ε = -N \(\frac{d}{d t}\)(BA cosθ)
           <br/>
           Thus emf can be induced by
           <br/>
           (a) changing the number of turns of coil, N
           <br/>
           (b) change the intensity of magnetic field, B
           <br/>
           (c) changing the area linked with field, A
           <br/>
           (d) changing the orientation of coil, θ
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Motional electromotive force and Faraday’s law: Consider a uniform magnetic field B confined to the region ABCD and a coil PQRS is placed inside the magnetic field. At any time t, the part P’Q = S’R = y of the coil is inside the magnetic field. Let l be the length of the arm of the coil.
           <br/>
           <img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-156166" height="132" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-12-Physics-Set-8-with-Solutions-22.png" width="254"/>
           <br/>
           Area of the coil inside the magnetic field at time t,
           <br/>
           ∆S = QR × RS’ = ly
           <br/>
           Magnetic flux linked with the coil at any timef,
           <br/>
           ϕ = B∆S = Bly
           <br/>
           The rate of change of magnetic flux linked with the coil is given by,
           <br/>
           \(\frac{d \phi}{d t}\) = \(\frac{d}{d t}\) (Bly)
           <br/>
           = BI \(\frac{d y}{d t}\) = BIv
           <br/>
           where, v is the velocity with which the coil is pulled out of the magnetic field.
           <br/>
           If e is the induced emf, then according to Faraday’s law, e = – \(\frac{d \phi}{d t}\) or e = -BIv
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Polarity of induced emf can be given by Lenz’s law.
           <br/>
           According to Lenz’s law, the polarity of induced emf is such that, it tends to produce a current which opposes the change in magnetic flux that produced it.
           <br/>
           From the Fleming’s right hand rule, the induced current due to induced emf will flow from the end R to Q, i.e. along SRQP in the coil.
