           Question 4.
           <br/>
           When sodium bicarbonate reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid, the gas evolved is:
           <br/>
           (A) Hydrogen; it gives a pop sound with burning match stick.
           <br/>
           (B) Hydrogen; it turns lime water milky.
           <br/>
           (C) Carbon dioxide; it turns lime water milky.
           <br/>
           (D) Carbon dioxide; it blows off a burning match stick with a pop sound.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (C) Carbon dioxide; it turns lime water milky.
          </p>
          <p>
           Explanation: When sodium hydrogen carbonate (sodium bicarbonate) is treated with dil. hydrochloric acid, a brisk effervescence is observed.
           <br/>
           This is due to the release of carbon dioxide gas.

           Question 8.
           <br/>
           Stomata are the tiny, kidney, or bean-shaped pores or openings present in the epidermis of the cell. Opening and closing of stomata is due to:
           <br/>
           (A) high pressure of gases inside the cells.
           <br/>
           (B) movement of water in and out of the guard cells.
           <br/>
           (C) stimulus of light in the guard cells.

           </sub>
           in and out of the guard cells.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (B) movement of water in and out of the guard cells.
          </p>
          <p>
           Explanation: The opening and closing of the stomatal pore is the function of guard cells. They swell when water flows into them, causing the stomatal pore to open and on the loss of turgidity the guard cells become flaccid leading to the closure of the stomatal pore.

           Question 21.
           <br/>
           Dil. HCl is added to Zn granules. How will you prove that chemical change has taken place here? Support your response with two arguments.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When zinc granules are added to dil. HC1, it leads to the formation of zinc chloride salt with the evolution of hydrogen gas. The evolved gas is colourless and odourless. Its chemical change can be detected by measuring the temperature change, by observing the change in colour of zinc from silver-grey to black, or by bubbles of gas.

           Why do arteries have thick and elastic walls, whereas veins have valves?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The main purpose of making urine in the body is to filter out nitrogenous waste products like urea and uric acid from the blood. The urinary bladder and urethra are the organs that store and release the urine, respectively.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           The blood emerges from the heart under high pressure and flows through arteries. Therefore, to resist this pressure, the arteries have thick and elastic walls. Veins have valves, which ensure that the blood flow occurs in one direction only.

           (b) Why was there a sharp drop in the amount of ozone in the atmosphere in the 1980s?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The amount of ozone in the atmosphere began to drop sharply in the 1980s. This decrease is due to synthetic chemicals like chlorofluorocarbons which are used as refrigerants and in fire extinguishers.

           Question 28.
           <br/>
           “Two different forms of carbon – diamond and graphite have different structures and very different physical properties even though their chemical properties are same.” Explain why.
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
          <p>
           Diamond and graphite are allotropes of carbon. Allotropes are the different forms of the element having different physical properties. The element carbon occurs in various forms in nature with different physical properties but nearly same chemical properties. Diamond is a giant molecule of carbon atoms in which each carbon atom is bonded to four other carbon atoms forming a rigid three-dimensional structure, which is responsible for its hardness. Graphite crystal consists of a layer of carbon atoms in which each carbon atom is bonded to three other carbon atoms in the same plane giving a hexagonal array. Graphite structure is formed by hexagonal array being placed in layer one above the other.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Tendrils are sensitive to touch. When they come in contact with any support, the part of the tendril in contact with the object does not grow as rapidly as the part of the tendril away from the object. This causes the tendril to circle the object and thus cling to it.
          </p>
          <p>
           Auxin is the hormone that promotes the growth of the tendril around the support as it is synthesized in the tip of the shoot and stimulates the growth of the cells on the opposite side which causes the coiling of the tendril around the support.

           <br/>
           (iii) Complete the ray diagram of the above scenario, when the light ray comes out of the plastic block from the top flat end.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) The refractive index of a medium concerning air is given by
           <br/>
           n = \(\frac{Speed of light in air}{Speed of light in the medium}\)
           <br/>
           Since the speed of light in the medium is always less than the speed of light in air, the refractive index of any material concerning air is always greater than 1.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The ray of light is undergoing normal incidence at the air-plastic block interface and for normal incidence, there is no deviation.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) As the light comes out of the plastic block from the top flat end, it moves away from the normal.

           <br/>
           (a) The current drawn from the mains.
           <br/>
           (b) Electric energy consumed if the motor is used for 5 hours daily for 6 days.
           <br/>
           (c) Total cost of energy consumed if the rate of one unit is ₹ 5.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Given,
           <br/>
           Voltage (V) = 220 V
           <br/>
           Power (P) = 1100 W
           <br/>
           (a) Power (P) is given by the expression,
           <br/>
           P = V × I
           <br/>
           1100 = 220 × I
           <br/>
           I = \(\frac{1100}{220}\)
           <br/>
           = 5A
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Electrical energy (E)
           <br/>
           \(\begin{aligned}
           <br/>
           &amp; =\frac{P(\text { in watt }) \times t(\text { in hour per day })}{1000} \times \text { No.of days } \\
           <br/>
           &amp; =\frac{1100 \mathrm{~W} \times(5 \mathrm{~h} / \text { day })}{1000} \times 6 \text { days }
           <br/>
           \end{aligned}\)
           <br/>
           = 33 units
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) Total cost = Energy × Rate
           <br/>
           = 33 units × \(\frac{\text { Rs. } 5}{\text { unit }}\) = Rs. 165

           Question 33.
           <br/>
           Anannya responded to the question: Why are electrical appliances with metallic bodies connected to the mains through a three-pin plug, whereas an electric bulb can be connected with a two-pin plug?
           <br/>
           She wrote: Three-pin connections reduce heating of connecting wires.
           <br/>
           (i) Is her answer correct or incorrect? Justify.
           <br/>
           (ii) What is the function of a fuse in a domestic circuit?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Anannya’s answer is incorrect. Electrical appliances with metallic bodies need an earth wire that provides a low-resistance conducting path to the flow of current. In case, there is an accidental leakage of current through the conducting body of the appliances.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) An electrical fuse is a safety device that operates to protect against the overflow of current in an electrical circuit. An important component of an electrical fuse is a metal wire or strip that melts when excess current flows through it.

           Question 35.
           <br/>
           Given below are certain situations. Analyse and describe its possible impact on a person
           <br/>
           (i) Testes of a male boy are not able to descend into the scrotum during his embryonic development.
           <br/>
           (ii) The vas deferens of a man is plugged.
           <br/>
           (iii) Prostate and seminal vesicles are not functional.
           <br/>
           (iv) Egg is not fertilized in a human female.
           <br/>
           (v) The placenta does not attach to the uterus optimally.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (i) A doctor has advised Sameer to reduce sugar intake in his diet and do regular exercise after checking his blood test reports. Which disease do you think Sameer is suffering from? Name the hormone responsible for this disease and the organ producing the hormone.
           <br/>
           (ii) Which hormone is present in the areas of rapid cell division in a plant and which hormone inhibits the growth?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Formation of the sperm will be adversely affected because this process requires a lower temperature than the body temperature.
           <br/>
           (ii) If the vas deferens of a man is plugged, sperms will not be transferred further because it is a passage for the transfer of sperms.
           <br/>
           (iii) When prostate and seminal vesicles are not functional, they will not secrete fluid for nourishment and medium for the transport of sperms.
           <br/>
           (iv) When an egg is not fertilized in a human female, it lives for about one day. Then, menstruation occurs in which the thickened lining of the uterus breaks leading to the discharge of blood and mucus along with the run fertilised egg.
           <br/>
           (v) When the placenta does not attach to the uterus optimally, nutrition and oxygen will not be provided to the growing embryo affecting its growth.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (i) Sameer is suffering from diabetes. Insulin is the hormone responsible for this disease and it is produced by the pancreas.
           <br/>
           (ii) Cytokinins are present in the areas of rapid cell divisions in a plant and abscisic acid inhibits the growth.

           Question 36.
           <br/>
           (a) A lens produces a magnification of -0.5. Is this a converging or diverging lens? If the focal length of the lens is 6 cm; draw a ray diagram showing the image formation in this case.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The image will be real and inverted since the magnification has a negative value. The lens that can produce a real and inverted image is a converging/ convex lens.

           (b) A girl was playing with a thin beam of light from a laser torch by directing it from different directions on a convex lens held vertically. She was surprised to see that in a particular direction, the beam of light continued to move along the same direction after passing through the lens. State the reason for her observation. Draw a ray diagram to support your answer.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The girl must have directed the ray of light along the direction of the optical centre of the lens because the ray of light passes straight through the optical centre of the lens.

           (a) Position 2
           <br/>
           (b) Position 3
           <br/>
           (ii) Find the potential difference across each lamp, when lit.
           <br/>
           (iii) Calculate the current
           <br/>
           (a) in each 12 Ω lamp, when lit.
           <br/>
           (b) in each 4 Ω lamp, when lit.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Show with calculations, which type of lamp, 4.0 Ω or 12 Ω has the higher power.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) (a) When switch A is connected to position 2, then 12 Ω lamps will switch ON only.
           <br/>
           (b) When switch A is connected to position 3, then 4 Ω lamps will switch ON.
           <br/>
           (ii) All the lamps are connected parallel to each other, hence the potential difference will be 12V for all the lamps.
           <br/>
           (a) 12 Ω lamps are ON when the wire is connected to position 2.
           <br/>
           The voltage across both 12 Ω lamps = 12V
           <br/>
           From V = IR (Ohm’s law),
           <br/>
           I = \(\frac{V}{R}=\frac{12}{12}\) = 1A
           <br/>
           (b) 4 Ω lamps are ON when the wire is connected to position 3.
           <br/>
           The voltage across both 4 Ω lamps = 12 V
           <br/>
           Hence, I = \(\frac{V}{R}=\frac{12}{4}\) = 3A
           <br/>
           (iii) The power is given by P = \(\frac{V^2}{R}\)
           <br/>
           All lamps are in parallel and hence V for all lamps are same.
           <br/>
           For 4 Ω lamps, P = \(\frac{12 \times 12}{4}\) = 36 W
           <br/>
           For 12 Ω lamps, P = \(\frac{12 \times 12}{12}\) = 12 W
           <br/>
           Hence, 4 Ω lamps will have higher power.
