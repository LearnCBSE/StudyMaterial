           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the following passage.
          </p>
          <p>
           1. Drishti was a young woman who had always been fascinated by the supernatural. She had read countess books and watched numerous documentaries about ghosts and otherworldly beings. So, when the heard about an abandoned hotel on the outskirts of town that was said to be haunted, she kntw she had to investigate.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           2. One night, Drishti decided to sneak into the dilapidated hotel with a few of her friends. As they made their way through the dark, eerie corridors, they heard strange noises and felt cold spots. They were convinced that they were not alone.
          </p>
          <p>
           3. Suddenly they came across a room that was different from the rest. It was filled with old cooking equipment and strange symbols etched into the walls. Drishti felt a chill run down her spine as she entered tile room. She knew that this was where the most paranormal activity occurred. As they were examining the room, they heard a loud bang coming from the hallway. They froze in fear, not knowing what was coming their way. They could hear footsteps approaching, and they knew they had to hide.
          </p>
          <p>
           4. They quicklV ducked behind some old shelves as the footsteps grew louder. The sound of breathing was gettingrloser and closer until, finally, they saw a figure appear in the doorway. It was a man wearing a clsf’s hat, with a face that was twisted in a sinister smile. Drishti and her friends felt their blood rrm cold as the man approached them. They could feel his cold breath on their faces as he leaned in, whispering in a deep voice, “You shouldn’t be here.”
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           5. Drishti and henfriends were frozen with fear as they stared into the chefs eyes. But, suddenly, the lights flickered in and the figure disappeared. They looked around the room and everything seemed normal. They tiaa been so scared that they hadn’t realised they were in a room with faulty wiring.
          </p>
          <p>
           6. Disappointed, they realised that their ghost hunt had been a bust. They left the hotel feeling deflated and let down. They had hoped for an exciting, spine-tingling adventure but all they got was a scary moment caused by faulty wiring. As they drove home, they couldn’t help but feel foolish for getting so worked up over nothing. They had been so convinced that they would find evidence of the paranormal that they had overlooked the simple explanation for the noises they had heard.
          </p>
          <p>
           7. Drishti learned an important lesson that night. Sometimes, the scariest things are the ones that we create in our own minds. She realised that she didn’t need to chasdafter the supernatural to experience thrills and excitement. The world around her was full of mystery and wonder, and she was content to experience it without the need for ghosts and ghouls.

          <p>
           Answer the following questions, based on the passage above.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           (i) How does the setting contribute to the overall mood and atmosphere of the story? (1)
           <br/>
           (a) It creates a sense of nostalgia
           <br/>
           (b) It provides a sense of false security
           <br/>
           (c) It adds to the suspense in the story
           <br/>
           (d) It presents a contrast with the real world
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (c) It adds to the suspense in the story
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) List two ways how the disappointment that Drishti and her friends felt after their ghost hunt is analogous to the feeling of waking up from a dream. Answer in 30 – 40 words. (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The disappointment that Drishti and her friends felt after their ghost hunt is analogous to the feeling of waking up from a dream simply because both involve a sense of disappointment that reality didn’t live up to their expectations. In both cases, they may have had high hopes for what they would experience, only to find that it was not as exciting or satisfying as they had hoped. Just as waking up from a dream can leave us feeling let down, Drishti’s realisation that the haunted hotel was not as spooky as she had imagined was a letdown for her and her friends.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) What is the main flaw in Drishti’s approach to investigating the hauntep hotel? (1)
           <br/>
           (a) She was too focused on finding evidence of the paranormal.
           <br/>
           (b) She was too skeptical and refused to believe in the possibility of ghosts.
           <br/>
           (c) She relied too heavily on other people’s accounts of the supernatural.
           <br/>
           (d) She didn’t take enough precautions to ensure her safety.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) She was too focused on finding evidence of the paranormal.
          </p>
          <p>
           <img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 10 English Communicative Set 1 with Solutions" height="16" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Learn-CBSE.png" width="116"/>
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) After which paragraph of the story, would the following paragraph mostlikely be placed? (1)
           <br/>
           They commenced walking through the hotel, Drishti’s torchlight barely illuminating the darkness around her. Suddenly, they heard a loud creaking noise behind them. Drishti whipped around, pointing her flashlight in the direction of the noise. Nothing. Shaken, they all quickened their pace.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           It would be placed after paragraph 2, because Drishti and her friends had just begun exploring. This , paragraph segues into paragraph 3 as it begins with ‘Suddenly…’, indicating that something happens 1 after ‘they all quickened their pace’. The other likely paragraphs could have been 3, 4 and 5 but they
           <br/>
           aren’t suitable as the apparent encounter has already taken place.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) Briefly explain (in 30 – 40 words) any two elements that classify the story as scary. (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The story creates a sense of suspense, unease and tension through its use of foreshadowing, eerie descriptions and unexplained phenomena. The hotel setting contributes to the overall sense of fear and dread, with its dilapidated and abandoned state. Further, the unexplained noises, movements, and apparitions suggest the presence of supernatural forces or entities.
          </p>
          <p>
           (vi) Substitute the underlined word in the following sentence with a word/ phrase from paragraphs 4 – 6, that means the same. (1)
          </p>
          <p>
           The sound of the footsteps outside the door left her
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            petrified
           </span>
           and the rasping breathing added to her horror.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           terrified
          </p>
          <p>
           (vii) What is the most significant lesson that Drishti learns from haunted hotel? (1)
           <br/>
           (a) The importance of avoiding risk – taking.
           <br/>
           (b) The need to be more sceptical of the supernatural.
           <br/>
           (c) The value of evaluating your weaknesses
           <br/>
           (d) The power of imagination to create suspense.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (b) The need to be more sceptical of the supernatural.
          </p>
          <p>
           (viii) Complete the following appropriately. (1)
          </p>
          <p>
           Based on the use of the word ‘dilapidated’ to describe the hot/1, in Paragraph 2, we can infer that its condition was …………..
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           in a state of decay, disrepair and neglect. It was old, damaged and possibly unsafe
          </p>
          <p>
           (ix) Complete the sentence appropriately. (1)
          </p>
          <p>
           If the title, The Hotel Haunting is given to this passage, it would be an inappropriate title, as compared to The Unsettling Encounter at the Abandoned Hotel because …………..
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           it makes assumptions about the presence of ghosts unlike the appropriate title which accurately reflects a spooky and unsettling experience at an abandoned hotel.
          </p>
          <p>
           (x) State whether the given assertion is True or False. (1)
          </p>
          <p>
           The reason Drishti and her friends visited the abandoned hotel was to prove the existence of ghosts.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           False.
           <br/>
           While Drishti and her friends did visit the abandoned hotel to investigate the rumors of ghosts, they didn’t do it to prove their existence. Their goal was to have an exciting adventure and to prove their bravery by spending a night in a supposedly haunted place.

           Answer the following questions, based on the table above.
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) Identify the person who is likely to ask many “why” questions, and support your choice with one reason. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Aryan is likely to ask many “why” questions.
           <br/>
           Reason (anyone):
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Aryan’s personal qualities include curiosity, creativity, and a love of learning. These qualities suggest that he is likely to ask many “why” questions to better understand the world around him.
           </li>
           <li>
            Aryan’s academic achievements and co-curricular activities demonstrate his strong critical thinking skills, which would likely lead him to ask thoughtful and insightful questions.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (ii) Which house captain is most likely to struggle the most with handling stress during the school’s annual inter-house sports tournament? [1]
           <br/>
           (A) Rohit
           <br/>
           (B) Sanya
           <br/>
           (C) Rajat
           <br/>
           (D) Ananya
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (A) Rohit
          </p>
          <p>
           Explanation:
           <br/>
           While all the house captains have different strengths and weaknesses, Rohit may struggle the most with handling the stress of the inter-house sports tournament due to his tendency to be overly competitive. This could lead to added pressure and anxiety during the tournament, which could impact his performance and ability to lead his team effectively. Sanya, Raj at, and Ananya all have personal qualities that could help them handle the stress of the tournament, such as compassion, perseverance, and confidence.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Give two justifications for Sanya being the best fit to lead a school-wide initiative to promote mental health and well-being among students. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Justification: (any two)
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Her motto “Service before self shows a commitment to helping others, which is essential for promoting mental health and well-being.
           </li>
           <li>
            Her co-curricular activities in the social service club and drama club demonstrate a desire to work with others and address important issues.
           </li>
           <li>
            Her personal qualities of compassion, organization, and responsibility would be valuable in leading such an initiative.
           </li>
           <li>
            Her academic achievements and awards, such as the Best Orator Award, demonstrate strong communication skills that are essential in promoting mental health and well-being.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (iv) Select the correct option to fill in the blank and complete the analogy.
           <br/>
           ________: paint brush:: Rajat: tabla [1]
           <br/>
           (A) Rohit
           <br/>
           (B) Sanya
           <br/>
           (C) Aryan
           <br/>
           (D) Ananya
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (D) Ananya
          </p>
          <p>
           Explanation:
           <br/>
           The question is asking for an association between a house captain and their respective co- curricular activity instrument. Rajat is associated with music and so is likely to engage with a tabla. To find the house captain that is going to engage with a paint-brush, we need to look for someone who is associated with Art. Ananya is the only house captain in the table that has Art as a co- curricular activity, making her the correct answer.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) Based on the personal qualities of the House Captains, why is Rajat the most likely to be a collaborative worker? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Rajat the most likely to be a collaborative worker because of his personal qualities of being a team player and an adaptable person.
          </p>
          <p>
           (vi) Complete the given sentence with the appropriate reason, regarding the information in the table.
           <br/>
           We can infer that Aryan’s overall performance may be negatively impacted by his weakness in time management because ………………. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           … because his drawback is procrastination which means that he may struggle with completing tasks on time, [While the other house captains may also have weaknesses or areas for improvement, the information provided in the table specifically highlights Aryan’s procrastination issue as a potential drawback that could affect his overall performance.]
          </p>
          <p>
           (vii) Explain briefly why situation (b), from the three situations given below, showcases Ananya’s motto, “Lead by example”? [1]
           <br/>
           (a) During a group project, Ananya assigns each team member specific tasks and sets a high standard for the project’s quality. She tells them to actively participate in the project and take it to fruition.
           <br/>
           (b) During a house debate competition, Ananya notices that a few of her house members are struggling to articulate their arguments effectively. Ananya takes the time to listen to their concerns and provides constructive feedback and support.
           <br/>
           (c) During a fund raising event, Ananya volunteers to be in charge of organising and coordinating the event but she frequently delegates tasks to others and attends to her school assignment while her team completes the task successfully.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The second situation (b) aligns with Ananya’s motto because she actively listens to her team members and provides support, ultimately helping them to succeed by leading through her actions and setting a positive example.
           <br/>
           [The first situation does not align with this motto because Ananya is not actively participating in the project herself, which is not leading by example. The third situation also does not align with this mottobecause Ananya is delegating tasks to others and not actively participating in the fund raising effort, which is also not leading by example.]
          </p>
          <p>

           This is regarding the upcoming inter-school dance competition on 12th September, 20XX, Friday, at the mandated venue, I would like to request to schedule transportation for our team from the school premises at 8:30 a.m. Our school’s participation is only in the senior category with 6 students. Hence, a mini-van would suffice instead of the school bus.

           Write a factual description, in not more than 100 words, of a potted plant that you and your sibling recently chose, to gift your parent. [4]

           Answer:
           <br/>
           We recently chose a potted plant called the Hibiscus as a gift for our mother. It was a small shrub with a height of about 1.5 feet. The leaves looked dark green, and shiny, and had a slightly serrated edge. The plant had several buds and appeared to be healthy and one large, fully blossomed deep-red flower had five petals and a prominent central stamen. The plant came in a small clay pot with a diameter of about 10 inches. It had a simple yellow and red abstract design that complemented the plant well. The soil in the pot looked moist and well-draining along with being enriched with organic matter.

          <p>
           Through the medium of this letter, I would like to request the inclusion of popular fiction and non-fiction titles in Braille and audiobooks in the City Library. I truly believe that the library should strive to promote inclusion and accessibility for all readers, including those with visual and other impairments. Many readers with visual impairment are often unable to access the same titles as others. By adding Braille and audiobooks to the library’s collection, we can ensure that these readers have the same access to a wide range of books and can engage with the world of literature as fully as anyone else.
          </p>
          <p>
           I urge you to consider this matter and add Braille and audiobooks to the library’s collection.
           <br/>
           I believe this move will help promote inclusion and accessibility in our community and help everyone to enjoy the benefits of reading.

           B. You are a sports scout. Write a letter to the Governor of your region, drawing attention to the need for creating and upgrading sport facilities and following practices to enable the local/indigenous sporting talent from your city, to hone their skills. Include specific recommendations. Write the letter in not more than 120 words using ideas from Unit 1: Health and Medicine, along with your own.

          <p>
           This is to draw your attention to the pressing need for creating and upgrading sports facilities in our region to support the development of local and indigenous sporting talent. Areas like Wagheilly have a vast pool of untapped taient, and there is a pressing need to provide them with the necessary infrastructure to heip them hone their skills.
          </p>
          <p>
           As an experienced sports scout, I can vouch for the fact that facilities like multi-purpose indoor sports complexes, outdoor sports fields, and running tracks with proper maintenance and lighting facilities are needed: Access to training and fitness centres and physiotherapy clinics, scholarships, mentorship programs, and tournaments can also promote talent and offer opportunities for local athletes to showcase their skills and earn recognition.
          </p>
          <p>
           By investing in sports and promoting iocal talent, we can create a culture of excellence and inspire the youth to take up sports as a career. I hope you my suggestions would be taken into consideration and will help create a city that promotes sports and the growth of local and indigenous sporting talent.

           (a) Choosing Your Travel Style: The Benefits and Drawbacks of Solo and Group Travel —by Hema Joseph, X-C
           <br/>
           Travelling is one of life’s greatest pleasures, and the way we prefer to travel varies from person to person. Some prefer solo travel, while others enjoy travelling in a group. Each preference has its advantages and disadvantages.
           <br/>
           Solo travel allows for complete independence and the freedom to choose the itinerary and pace. It also provides an opportunity for self-discovery and personal growth. However, solo travel can be lonely, especially during meal times and at night. Besides this, it can be more expensive, as accommodation and transportation costs are not shared.
           <br/>
           Travelling in a group can be a great way to meet new people and make friends. It is also less expensive, as costs are shared among the group. However, group travel requires more planning and coordination, and sometimes compromises must be made. Additionally, some people may feel restricted by the group’s itinerary and activities.
           <br/>
           Factors that influence travel preferences include personality type, budget, destination, and the purpose of travel. Extroverts may prefer group travel, while introverts may opt for solo travel. Budget constraints may make group travel more feasible, while adventure destinations may be better suited for solo travel.
           <br/>
           Ultimately, the decision to travel solo or in a group is a personal one. Both options have their pros and cons, and travellers should weigh them carefully before embarking on their journey.

           (b) Space Tourism: Balancing Opportunity and Responsibility — by Jagmeet Singh, X-D
           <br/>
           Space tourism, the idea of sending tourists into space for a few minutes or days, is becoming a reality. However, the opportunities and challenges of space tourism are complex, and ethical considerations need to be taken into account.
           <br/>
           One opportunity of space tourism is that it could inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers, providing a new way to get people interested in space exploration. However, space tourism also presents many challenges, including the potential impact on the environment. Space debris is already a major problem, and increased space traffic from tourism could exacerbate this issue.
           <br/>
           What also causes concern is that it could contribute to the commodification of space, turning it into a playground for the rich rather than a shared resource for all humanity. There is also the question of putting paying tourists at risk for the sake of leisure activities.
           <br/>
           As we move ahead with this exciting new industry, we must remain mindful of the impact on our planet, our society, and the future of space exploration.

           (B) ANTONY: If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
           <br/>
           You all do know this mantle: I remember
           <br/>
           The first time Caesar put it on;
           <br/>
           ‘Twas on a summer’s evening, in his tent,
           <br/>
           That day he overcame the Nervii:
           <br/>
           Look, in this place ran Cassius’ dagger through:
           <br/>
           See what a rent the envious Casca made:
           <br/>
           Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb’d;
           <br/>
           And as he pluck’d his cursed steel away,
           <br/>
           (Julius Caesar)
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) How does Antony use visual imagery to make his point about the assassination of Caesar? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Antony uses vivid and evocative descriptions of the wounds inflicted on Caesar by his assassins, to stir up emotions in his audience and to create a sense of horror and outrage.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) What is the significance of the mantle that Antony refers to, in his speech? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The mantle represents Caesar’s power and authority and serves as a symbol of the leader’s ability to inspire loyalty and devotion in his followers.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Identify the tone of Antony’s statement when he says, “If you have tears, prepare to shed them now”. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           emotive and urgent [as he seeks to move his audience to tears and to evoke a sense of shared grief and loss]
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) What does Antony’s reference to the Nervii suggest about Caesar’s military prowess? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Antony’s reference to the Nervii, whom Caesar defeated in battle, highlights Caesar’s skill as a military leader and his ability to conquer even the most formidable enemies.
          </p>
          <p>
           (C) “Well,” I said, “we’re leaving on Monday. Is there anything I can do for you before we go?”
           <br/>
           Nicola shook his head, but suddenly Jacopo said, “Sir,” he burst out, “every Sunday we
           <br/>
           make a visit to the country, to Poleta, 30 kilometres from here. Usually, we hire bicycles.
           <br/>
           But tomorrow, since you are so kind, you might send us in your car.”
           <br/>
           I had already told Luigi he might have the Sunday off. However, I answered, “I’ll drive
           <br/>
           you out myself.”
           <br/>
           There was a pause. Nicola was glaring at his young brother in vexation. “We could not
           <br/>
           think of troubling you, sir.”
           <br/>
           “It won’t be any trouble.”

          </p>
          <p>
           (i) Identify the phrase that indicates that the visit to Poleta on Sundays is significant as a routine or tradition. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           “every Sunday”
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) What does the narrator’s offer to drive the brothers to Poleta reveal about his character? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           kindness/generosity
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Why was there a pause after the narrator’s offer? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (Anyone)
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Nicola was taken aback by Jacopo’s request and needed a moment to process it.
           </li>
           <li>
            Nicola was hesitant to accept help from the narrator, possibly due to pride or a desire to be self-sufficient.
           </li>
           <li>
            A moment of awkwardness or tension as the brothers considered the offer and the potential implications of accepting it.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (iv) State one reason why Jacopo might have wanted a car ride despite the choice of hired bicycles. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (Anyone)
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            a car ride would be more efficient and less tiring than cycling for 30 kilometers
           </li>
           <li>
            an opportunity to experience something different and more comfortable

           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Answer Any Five of the following six questions in about 30 – 40 words each. (5 × 2 = 10)
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) How effective is the use of the phrase “Nothing beside remains”, in conveying the theme of the transience and impermanence of power and human achievement, in Ozymandias by P.B.Shelley? (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The use of the phrase is highly effective as it emphasises the idea that even the greatest accomplishments of human beings will eventually crumble and disappear, leaving behind only the inevitable march of time. By emphasising this theme, Ozymandias serves as a powerful reminder of the fleeting nature of human existence and the futility of pursuing power and glory at the expense of more meaningful pursuits.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) What does the writer wish to convey via the use of the metaphor for a false friend in the given line from The Letter? (2)
           <br/>
           ……………. The cold used sleep to extend its sway over all things even as a false friend lulls his chosen victim with caressing smiles.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The metaphor of a false friend is used in The Letter’ to describe the winter cold, which is depicted as a treacherous and sneaky force that gradually extends its sway over all things. Like a false friend, the cold initially seems harmless and even welcoming, as it lulls its victims into a false sense of security with its ‘caressing smiles.’ However, as the metaphor suggests, the cold is not a friend at all, but a deceiver who ultimately seeks to harm and control its victims.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Comment on Elsie Brown’s writing style in the story, The Shady Plot. (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Elsie Brown’s writing style in ‘A Shady Plot’ is characterized by its light and humorous tone. The story is written in the first person point of view of the protagonist, John Hallock. Brown’s writing is concise and clear, with a good use of dialogue and description to create vivid scenes and characters. She uses irony and satire to poke fun at the publishing industry and its practices. Overall, her writing style effectively conveys the story’s humour and underlying message, making it an enjoyable and thought-provoking read.

           (iv) In Patol Babu, Film Star, how is Patol Babu’s character a commentary on the struggling actors in the film industry? (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Through Patol Babu’s character, Satyajit Ray highlights the plight of the struggling actors who often go unnoticed and the difficulties they face in getting even small roles. Patol Babu’s dedication to his craft and his ability to turn even a minor role into a memorable one is a testament to the hard work and determination of many such individuals in the industry.

           (v) In the story, Virtually True, Michael said , “That’s what I like about computers. The more futuristic they get, the better you can understand the past.” Explain what he mean (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Michael is expressing his enthusiasm for the capabilities of modern technology, such as computers, to help him experience and understand historical events and settings in a more immersive way. He is suggesting that as technology advances and becomes more futuristic, it can allow people to have more vivid and realistic experiences that bring the past to lite. This could include using virtual reality technology to explore historical sites or playing interactive games that simulate historical events. Michael sees technology as a tool that can enhance our understanding and appreciation of the past.

           (vi) What is Stanley Houghton’s primary purpose in employing irony in the play The Dear Departed? (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Stanley Houghton’s primary purpose in employing irony in The Dear Departed’ is to satirize the societal values and behaviours of his time, particularly the greed and materialism of the middle class. The story also exposes the hypocrisy and moral bankruptcy of characters like the Slaters and the Jordans, who prioritise money and possessions over family and morality. It allows the audience to see the absurdity and superficiality of these characters’ values and beliefs, and to question the larger societal values that have led to such behavior.

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Answer ANY ONE of the following two questions in about 150 words. [8]
          </p>
          <p>
           (A) Even though both, the frog from Vikram Seth’s poem, The Frog and the Nightingale, and Abel’s children from the play, The Dear Departed, display greed, there are differences. Elaborate, in about 150 words, how the greed of the frog and that of Abel’s children differ in motivation, actions, relationship, and consequences.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           (B) Imagine that the mariner hears of Mrs. Packletide’s hunt and decides to share some advice with her, about the impact of wilfully killing creatures. As the mariner, write this letter, in about 150 words, to Mrs. Packletide, based on the consequences following your own experience of having killed a creature intentionally.
           <br/>
           (Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Mrs Packletide’s Tiger)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (A) (Answer can be woven along the following lines) Their greed can be distinguished:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Motivation: The frog’s greed is motivated by a desire for personal gain and success, whereas Abel’s children are motivated by a desire for material possessions and inheritance.
           </li>
           <li>
            Actions: The frog takes advantage of the nightingale’s talent and exploits her, while Abel’s children scheme to acquire their father’s belongings through deception.
           </li>
           <li>
            Relationship: The frog and the nightingale have a business relationship, while Abel’s children have a familial relationship with their father.
           </li>
           <li>
            Consequences: The consequences of the frog’s greed result in the nightingale’s demise, while the consequences of Abel’s children’s greed result in a family dispute and moral dilemma.
            <br/>
            (accept any other rational variation)
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           OR
          </p>
          <p>
           (B) (Answer can be woven along the following lines)
           <br/>
           The advice might include the following points:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The mariner would advise Mrs. Packletide to consider the consequences of her actions. In the poem, the mariner kills an albatross and brings a curse upon himself and his crew. He learns the hard way that there are often unintended consequences to our actions.
           </li>
           <li>
            He would also advise Mrs. Packletide to respect the creatures she encounters. In the poem, the mariner does appreciate the beauty of the albatross. He might encourage Mrs. Packletide to see the tiger as a majestic creature that deserves to be appreciated and respected, rather than simply a trophy to be mounted on her wall.
           </li>
           <li>
            Additionally, the mariner might encourage Mrs. Packletide to think about the value of life. He might caution Mrs. Packletide against taking life lightly, and encourage her to consider the value of the tiger’s life before taking it.
           </li>
           <li>
            Finally, the mariner might advise Mrs. Packletide to be mindful of her impact on the world around her. In the poem, the mariner’s actions have far-reaching consequences, affecting not just himself and his crew. He might encourage Mrs. Packletide to think about how her actions affect the world around her and to strive to make a positive impact rather than a negative one.
           </li>
          </ul>
