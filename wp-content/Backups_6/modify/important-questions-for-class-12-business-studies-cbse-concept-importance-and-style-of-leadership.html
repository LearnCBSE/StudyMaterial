           <strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           It is the process of influencing the behaviour of other people so that they work willingly for the attainment of goals in a given situation. It is regarded as the most important element of directing function. According to Theo Haimann, ‘Leadership is the process by which an executive imaginatively directs, guides and influences the work of others in choosing and attaining specified goals by mediating between the individuals and the organisation in such a manner that both will obtain maximum satisfaction.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Importance of leadership
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Leadership is considered as the most important element of directing function because of the following reasons:
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (i) Effective direction
           </strong>
           An organisation comes into existence with certain objectives. To attain the objectives, the activities of the Organisation must be directed. Direction of the activities is effected through leadership. In short, effective leadership directs the activities of an organisation towards the attainment of the specified organisational goals.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (ii) Source of motivation
           </strong>
           Effective leadership motivates the subordinates to contribute their energies for the benefit of the organisation.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (iii) Provide confidence
           </strong>
           Leadership creates confidence in the subordinates by giving them proper guidance and advice.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (iv) High morale
           </strong>
           Good leadership increases the morale of the employees which in turn, contributes to higher productivity.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (v) Development of team spirit
           </strong>
           Effective leadership promotes team spirit and team work which is quite essential for the success of an organisation.

            11. Leadership style refers to behaviour pattern, which leader reflects in his role as a leader. On the basis of this statement discuss the different types of leadership styles, giving suitable examples. (All india2008)
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           Following are the types of leadership styles:
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (i) Autocratic/Authoritative leadership
           </strong>
           Under this style, all decision-making power is vested in the leader and he exercises complete control over his subordinates.
           <br/>
           The leader determines the policies without consulting them and assign task to them without giving them any freedom. It is like ‘bossing people around’. It is a boss centered leadership, and is also called directive style of leadership.
           <br/>
           e.g. Mr Ratan, the GM of Addi Industries delegates the work to his staff Ms Ritu, Mr Saurabh, Mr Manan, according to his discretion. Here Mr Ratan is behaving as an autocratic leader.
           <br/>

           <strong>
            (ii) Democratic/Participative leadership
           </strong>
           Under this style, leader consults his subordinates in decision-making process and works out policies with the acceptance of the group. He encourages them to give suggestions in setting goals and implementing decisions. It is group centered leadership.
           <br/>
           e.g. Mr Ratan realised that due to the absence of Mr Manan, the targets will not be met, so he discusses with his staff about meeting the deadline. Every body decided to do overtime and complete the task. Here Mr Ratan is behaving as a democratic leader
           <br/>

           <strong>
            (iii) Laissez-faire/Free-rein leadership
           </strong>
           Under this style, the leader gives full freedom to the subordinates in setting goals. Such a leader avoids use of power. The leader does not interfere in the activities of the subordinates. Group members work themselves as per their own choice and competence. It is called subordinate centered leadership, e.g. The staff plans to organise a party in the honour of Mr Manan as he got promoted. Mr Ratan asks the other members of the staff to fix the venue and menu for the occasion. Here,  Mr Ratan is behaving as a free-rein leader.

           <strong>
            NOTE
           </strong>
           A leader may use all the styles over a period of time. However, one style tends to predominate the normal way of using power.
