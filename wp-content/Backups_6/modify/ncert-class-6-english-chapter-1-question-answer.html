          </p>
          <p>
           (c) How could Rama Natha have a big banana plantation after six years?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Rama Natha continued planting bananas regularly for six years. Naturally, it could grow as a big plantation.
          </p>
          <p>
           (d) How did the sage make Rama Natha believe that there is no magic potion?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The sage made Rama Natha believe that there existed no such potion. If he hadn’t told him Rama Natha could not have been given this important lesson of life.
          </p>
          <p>
           (e) Fill in the ‘before’ and ‘after’ table about Rama Natha.

           All these words have the letter ‘s’ in them. But the sound of the letter ‘s’ is not always the same.

           </li>

            in tree
            <strong>
             s
            </strong>
            – the letter ‘s’ has a /z/ sound
           </li>

           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Now, speak each word clearly along with your teacher and classmates. Your teacher will now say some words. Listen carefully to the sound of ‘s’. Write the sound next to the word.

            Scene 1: Rama Natha’s Home
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Narrator: (Voiceover) Rama Natha was the son of a rich landlord. His father left him large tracts of land, but he spent all his time searching for a magic potion that could turn objects into gold.
           <br/>
           Rama Natha: (Determined, pacing) I know there’s a magic potion out there. I just need to find it!
           <br/>
           Madhumati: (Worried, approaching Rama Natha) Rama Natha, you’ve spent so much money and time on this. We’ll be without money soon!
           <br/>
           Rama Natha: (Resolute) I can’t give up, Madhumati. I have to find it.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Scene 2: Meeting Sage Mahipati
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Narrator: (Voiceover) One day, a famous sage named Mahipati came to their town. Rama Natha approached him with hope.
           <br/>
           Rama Natha: (Excited) Sage Mahipati, I’ve heard you know about the magic potion. Please, tell me!
           <br/>
           Sage Mahipati: (Calm, wise) Yes, in my travels in the Himalayas, I heard how you could make such a potion. But it is difficult.
           <br/>
           Rama Natha: (Eager) Tell me, Sage! I’ll do anything.
           <br/>
           Sage Mahipati: (Instructive) Plant a banana plant and water it regularly with your hands. In winter, collect the morning dew from the leaves. When you have five liters of dew, bring it to me. I will chant some magic words, and it will turn into a potion.
           <br/>
           Rama Natha: (Worried) But winter is only for a few months. It will take years to collect that much dew.
           <br/>
           Sage Mahipati: (Encouraging) You can plant as many banana plants as you want. But remember, you must look after them yourself and collect the dew with your own hands.
          </p>
          <p>

           <br/>
           Narrator: (Voiceover) Rama Natha went home and, after talking to Madhumati, started cleaning his fields and planting rows of banana plants.
           <br/>
           Madhumati: (Supportive) I’ll help you, Rama Natha. Let’s work together.
           <br/>
           Rama Natha: (Grateful) Thank you, Madhumati. We can do this.
           <br/>
           Narrator: (Voiceover) They worked hard, and during the winter months, collected the dew with great care. Over the years, they expanded their plantation and earned money from selling bananas.
          </p>

           <br/>
           Rama Natha: (Hopeful) Here is the dew, Sage. Please chant the magic words.
           <br/>
           Sage Mahipati: (Smiling, chanting softly) Try it out.
           <br/>
           Rama Natha: (Sprinkling the dew on a copper vessel, waiting) Nothing happened! This is cheating!
           <br/>
           Sage Mahipati: (Calm) Madhumati, please come forward.
           <br/>
           Madhumati: (Carrying a box, opening it) Look, Rama Natha!
           <br/>
           Rama Natha: (Astonished) Gold coins? How?
           <br/>
           Sage Mahipati: (Wise) There is no magic potion. Your hard work on the plantation and Madhumati’s efforts in selling the bananas created this wealth. I played a trick on you to show you the value of hard work.
           <br/>
           Rama Natha: (Understanding) Thank you, Sage. I see the wisdom in your words. From now on, I will work even harder.
           <br/>
           Narrator: (Voiceover) And so, Rama Natha and Madhumati continued to work diligently, creating a prosperous and fulfilling life through their efforts.
