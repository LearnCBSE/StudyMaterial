Then in 1917, he organised a Satyagraha to support the peasants of the Kheda district of Gujarat. Affected by crop failure and a plague epidemic, the peasants of Kheda could not pay the revenue, and were demanding that revenue collection be relaxed.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) In February 1922, Mahatama Gandhi decided to withdraw the Non-Cooperation movement because:
           <br/>
           (i) He felt that the movement was turning violent in many places.
           <br/>
           (ii) Satyagrahis needed to be properly trained before they would be ready for struggles.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (b) The outbreak of the First World War had created a new economic and political situation in India:
           <br/>
           (i) The increased defence expenditure was financed by war loans and by raising tax rates, custom duties, etc. There was tremendous price rise during the war years. Between 1913 and 1918, the prices had almost doubled. People, particularly common people, were facing extreme hardships.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Forced recruitment in the army caused widespread anger in the villages.

           <br/>
           The economic outcomes of the democracy are:
           <br/>
           (a) Democracy assists in the eradication of various programmes and procedures that are not helpful for the people of the country.
           <br/>
           (b) Economic development in democracies helps in reducing thef economic disparities in a country.
           <br/>
           (c) Democracy works hard to encourage the feeling of freedom and dignity of citizens. This helps in developing an atmosphere of peace and calm in the country which is helpful in bringing economic prosperity.

           Question 8.

           Explain the three important ‘terms of Credit’.
           <br/>

           <br/>
           Three important terms of credit are:
           <br/>
           (i) Interest Rate. The Interest rate is the rate that is decided while borrowing and lending money. The rate is mentioned in the document.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Collateral. It is an asset that the borrower owns like a house, shop, property etc. whose ownership documents are taken by the banks as collateral against the loan.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Documentation required. The borrowers before lending money check all the documents related to the employment record and income earned by the borrower.

           Question 9.
           <br/>
           (a) Examine any five major challenges faced by the political parties in India.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (b) “Political parties play an important role in democratic countries.” Justify the statement.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Challenges faced by the political parties:
           <br/>
           (a) (i) The first challenge is lack of internal democracy within parties. All over the world there is a tendency in political parties towards the concentration of power in one or few leaders at the top.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Parties do not keep membership registers, do not hold organisational meetings, and do not conduct internal elections regularly. Ordinary members of the party do not get sufficient information on what happens inside the party.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) The third challenge of dynastic succession is related to the first one. Since most
           <br/>
           political parties do not practice open and transparent procedures for their functioning, there are very few ways for an ordinary worker to rise to the top in a party.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) The fourth challenge is about the growing role of money and muscle power (criminals) in parties, especially during elections. Since parties are focussed only on winning elections, they tend to use short-cuts to win elections. They tend to nominate those candidates who have or can raise lots of money.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) The fifth challenge is that very often parties do not seem to offer a meaningful choice to the voters.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (b) “Political parties are a necessary condition for a democracy”:
           <br/>
           (i) Without political parties democracies cannot exist. If we do not have political parties, every candidate in elections will be independent.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) No single candidate will be in a position to make any promises to the people about any major policy changes.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) The government may be formed but its utility will remain uncertain as all the individuals with different agendas will have to form the government.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) Elected representatives will be accountable to their constituency, for what they do in their locality but no one will be responsible for how the country will run.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) As societies become large and complex they also needed some agencies to gather different views on various issues and to present these to the government, that’s why political parties are needed.

           <br/>
           (a) Markets have transformed in the recent years:
           <br/>
           (i) The goods and services are produced globally as a result they are being sold internationally.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Production is widely dispersed so locations are getting interlinked.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Foreign trade has resulted in connecting the markets or integration of markets in different countries and today’s world is teamed as global village.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) More and more goods and services, investments and technology are moving between countries as international trade is increasing.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) Technology has made much faster delivery of goods across long distances possible at low costs.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (b) MNCs set up production in various countries based on the following factors:
           <br/>
           (i) MNCs set up offices and factories for production in regions where they can get cheap labour and other resources.
           <br/>
           For example, in countries like China, Bangladesh and India. These countries also provide with the advantage of cheap manufacturing locations.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) At times, MNCs set up production jointly with some of the local companies of countries around the world. The benefit of such joint production to the local company is two-fold. First, the MNCs can provide money for additional investments for faster production. Secondly, the MNCs bring with them the latest technology for enhancing and improving production.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Some MNCs are so big that their wealth exceeds the entire budgets of some developing countries. This is the reason why they buy up local companies to expand production.
           <br/>
           For example, Cargill Foods, a very large American MNC bought over smaller Indian companies such as Parakh Foods.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) There is another way in which MNCs control production and that is by placing orders for production with small producers in developing nations; e.g., garments, footwear, sports items etc. The products are supplied to these MNCs which then sell these under their own brand name to customers. MNCs also enter into close competition with local companies thereby influencing production in distant locations.

           Case Based Questions [4 × 2 = 8]
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 11.
           <br/>
           Read the given case and answer the questions that follow:
           <br/>
           Mahatma Gandhi’s thoughts on Satyagraha
           <br/>
           ‘It is said of “passive resistance” that it is the weapon of the weak, but the power which is the subject of this article can be used only by the strong. This power is not passive resistance; indeed it calls for intense activity. The movement in South Africa was not passive but active…’
           <br/>
           ‘Satyagraha is not physical force. A satyagrahi does not inflict pain on the adversary; he does not seek his destruction… In the use of satyagraha, there is no ill-will whatever.’ ‘Satyagraha is pure soul-force. Truth is the very substance of the soul. That is why this force is called satyagraha. The soul is informed with knowledge. In it burns the flame of love… Non-violence is the supreme dharma …’
           <br/>
           ‘It is certain that India cannot rival Britain or Europe in force of arms. The British worship the war-god and they can all of them become, as they are becoming, bearers of arms. The hundreds of millions in India can never carry arms. They have made the religion of non-violence their own…’
           <br/>
           (11.1) What type of movement Gandhiji organised in South Africa?
           <br/>
           (11.2) Why is satyagraha considered as pure soul-force?
           <br/>
           (11.3) How has Gandhiji described passive resistance?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           11.1 Gandhiji organised a non-violent movement in South Africa. He was instrumental in establishing South African Indian Congress.
          </p>
          <p>
           11.2 Satyagraha is considered as pure soul-force because, it emphasises the idea of truth and is against violence.
          </p>
          <p>
           11.3 Gandhiji introduced the concept of Satyagraha that means “Passive resistance”. This passive resistance means ‘soul force’ or ‘truth force’. Passive resistance is a method of securing rights by personal suffering, it has no ill-will whatsoever.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 12.
           <br/>
           Read the given case and answer the questions that follow:
           <br/>
           Industrial locations are complex in nature. These are influenced by availability of raw material, labour, capital, power and market, etc. It is rarely possible to find all these factors available at one place. Consequently, manufacturing activity tends to locate at the most appropriate place where all the factors of industrial location are either available or can be arranged at lower cost. After an industrial activity starts, urbanisation follows.
          </p>
          <p>
           Sometimes, industries are located in or near the cities. Thus, industrialisation and urbanisation go hand in hand. Cities provide markets and also provide services such as banking, insurance, transport, labour, consultants and financial advice, etc. to the industry. Many industries tend to come together to make use of the advantages offered by the urban centres known as agglomeration economies. Gradually, a large industrial agglomeration takes place.
           <br/>
           In the pre-Independence period, most manufacturing units were located in places from the point of view of overseas trade such as Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, etc. Consequently, there emerged certain pockets of industrially developed urban centres surrounded by a huge agricultural rural hinterland.
           <br/>
           (12.1) Mention any two factors which influence industrial location.
           <br/>
           (12.2) Where were most of the manufacturing units located during the pre-independence period
           <br/>
           (12.3) How does a large agglomeration of economies takes place?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           12.1 (a) Availability of Raw material.
           <br/>
           (b) Availability of Labour, Capital, Power etc.
          </p>
          <p>
           12.2 During the pre-independence period, most of the manufacturing units were located in places from the point of view of overseas trade such as Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
           12.3 A large agglomeration of economies takes place in the following manner:
           <br/>
           (a) Cities provide markets and services such as banking, insurance, transport, labour, -consultants and financial advice etc, to the industry.
           <br/>
           (b) Many industries come together to make use of the advantages offered by these urban cities thus leading to agglomeration of economies.
