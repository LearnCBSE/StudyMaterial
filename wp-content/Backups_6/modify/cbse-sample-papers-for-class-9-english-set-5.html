           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the following text. [10]
          </p>
          <p>
           1. When you grow up in a place where it rains for five months a year, wise elders help you to get acquainted with the rain early. They teach you that it is ignorance to think that it is the same rain falling every day. Oh no! the rain is always doing different things at different times. There is rain that is gentle, and there is also rain that falls too hard and damages the crops. Hence, pray for the sweet rain that helps the crops to grow.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           2. The monsoon in the Naga Hills goes by the native name, Khuthotei (which means the rice-growing season). It lasts from May to early or mid-October. The local residents firmly believe that Durga Puja in October announces the end to rain. After that, one might expect a couple of short winter showers, and the spring showers in March and April. Finally, comes the ‘big rain’ in May; proper rainstorms accompanied by heart – stopping lightning and ear-splitting thunder. I have stood out in storms looking at lightning arc across the dark skies, a light-and-sound show that can go on for hours.
          </p>
          <p>
           3. This is the season when people use the word ‘sezuo’ and ‘suzu’ to refer to the week-long rains, when clothes don’t dry and smell of mould, when fungus forms on the floor and you can’t see the moon or the stars.
          </p>
          <p>
           4. The rains are also called after flowering plants and people believe that the blossoming of those plants draws out rain. Once the monsoon sets in, field work is carried out in earnest and the work of uprooting and transplanting paddy in flooded fields is done. The months of hard labour are June, July and August. In August, as the phrogo plant begins to bloom, a rain will fall. This August rain, also called phrogo, is a sign that the time for cultivation is over. If any new grain seeds are sown, they may not sprout; even if they do sprout, they are not likely to bear grain. The rain acts as a kind of farmer’s almanac.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           5. The urban population of school-goers and office-goers naturally dislikes the monsoon and its accompanying problems of landslides, muddy, streets and periodic infections. For non-farmers, the month of September can be depressing, when the rainfall is incessant and the awareness persists that the monsoons will last out till October. One needs to have the heart of a farmer to remain grateful for the watery days, and be able to observe from what seems to the inexperienced as a continuous downpour-many kinds of rain. Some of the commonly known rain-weeks are named after the plants that alternately bloom in August and September. The native belief is that the flowers draw out the rain.
          </p>
          <p>
           6. Each rain period has a job to fulfil: October rain helps garlic bulbs to form, while kumunyo rain helps the rice bear grain. Without it, the ears of rice cannot form properly. End of October is the most beautiful month in the Naga Hills, as the fields turn gold and wild sunflowers bloom over the slopes, all heralding the harvest. Prayers go up for protecting the fields from storms, and the rains to retreat because the grains need to stand in the sun and ripen. The cycle nears completion a few weeks before the harvest, and the rain does retreat so thoroughly from the reaped furrows that the earth quickly turns hard. The months of rain becomes a distant memory until it starts all over again.

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Read the following text. [10]
          </p>
          <p>

           4. Being fierce in nature, Royal Bengal Tigers are not much friendly in nature and live a solitary life, except in winters when they can be seen in a group of 3 or 4. Bengal tigers are fast runners and good swimmers. Tigers attack their prey in a stealth mode. They are usually spotted in swamps, mangroves, and grasslands.
          </p>
          <p>
           5. Royal Bengal Tigers have very sharp memory; they never forget the faces. Their memory is sharper than humans and other animals.

           7. To know about the latest tiger population is always government’s concern, as they want to save this majestic animal from getting extinct. India has lost 97% of its Royal Bengal Tigers population in the last century. The main reason is hunting, Poaching, Urbanisation, Habitat loss and Illegal Wildlife Trade. Poaching means to illegally trade the tiger made products like tiger skin, tiger made jewellery, etc. These skin and jewellery are sold for millions in the international market. Poaching has reduced the number of tigers to just 3,800 from 1,00,000 in the starting of the 20th century.

[STD 9 Q.B. Page-55, Q.5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Rani Laxmi Bai of Jhansi
          </p>
          <p>
           Indian history is full of the heroic deeds of great heroes and heroines. Rani Laxmi Bai is one of them. She was the most remarkable personality of her age. She was a great freedom fighter. She was the first woman to sacrifice her life for the freedom of the country. She sacrificed her life but did not bow down before the English rulers. This star of heroism was born on November 1, 1835 in a noble family in Benaras. Her father was Moropanth Tambe and her mother was Bhagirathi Bai. Her parents named her Manikarnika after the river Ganga. In her childhood, she was called Manu. She was fond of horse riding and shooting. Once, she jumped from her own horse and saved the life of Nana Sahib.
          </p>
          <p>
           She was married to Gangadhar Rao, the ruler of Jhansi, and became Maharani Laxmi Bai of Jhansi. She gave birth to a baby boy who died only after three months. During her married life, she took keen interest in military training. When Raja Gangadhar Rao died, the English rulers wanted to capture Jhansi but Rani ruined their plans to capture Jhansi. She fought bravely and defended her state from the Britishers. She was a great patriot, fearless and brave. She inspired Indian rulers against the cruelty of the British rule in India. She took an active part in the struggle for freedom in 1857 and sacrificed her life in the battle. She was only twenty-three then. No doubt, Rani Lakshmi Bai is one of the most famous Indian woman.

           Dear Diary
          </p>
          <p>
           These days, speaking in English has become the need of the hour. Nobody can deny this fact. Even my parents also agree with it. But they are unable to do so. Though it is not their fault or any weakness for which they should feel shy in the modern world, yet I have a keen desire to teach them to speak in English. This language is a link with the outer world as it is an international language—a handy means of communication with the people around the world. I shall help them in this so that they will feel more confident. First, I’ll give them lessons in grammar, then shall proceed to introductory dialogue speaking and will gradually move to small speeches on the topics of their interest. I am sure my parents will be, at the earliest, able to talk and express themselves in English independently.

           An old couple was living in Shobit’s adjacent flat. One day he saw some commotion in their house. He went there and found that there were some masked people who were threatening the old couple and they were trying to escape from their grip. Meanwhile, there was a sound of hooter and people saw three cars coming towards their house. Now, the robbers were trying to free themselves but they were in the control of the couple. People were surprised how the old couple could be able to handle the young robbers. By now, police had also reached the spot and arrested all the robbers.

           People showed their gratitude to the police but all of a sudden, there was a sound, ‘Cut’. The people were surprised as all the people including the old couple, robbers and police were laughing. Shobit was quite amazed to know that all this was the shooting for a TV serial. Now all the people came to know that the old man was director of TV films. Shobit took a sigh of relief and decided to approach the old man to get himself introduced on the silver screen.

           Even so I thought I would turn around and take a look. No sooner had I turned than a fat snake wriggled over the back of the chair and landed on my shoulder. The snake’s landing on me and my turning were simultaneous. I didn’t jump. I didn’t tremble. I didn’t cry out. There was no time to do any such thing.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The story revolves around the narrator, the snake and the mirror. The narrator hears some familiar sounds – a dull thud and a snake lands on his shoulder. The doctor is terrified and sits there like a stone. He suddenly feels the presence of the creator of the world and the presence of death four inches away. In this moment of death, he realises the presence of God and grows humble about his views. The snake looks into the mirror, moves towards it as it wants to enjoy a close reflection in the mirror. Thus, the title is justified as the story revolves around the snake and the mirror.

           (B) What is the theme of the poem ‘The Road Not Taken’?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The poem ‘The Road Not Taken’ offers a profound perception into the process of decision making. The traveller at the crossroads of the diverging roads is symbolic of an individual at a decisive moment in his life’s journey. His decision or choice of future action, which road he should adopt either spiritualism or materialism, is of utmost significance since the decision decides his destiny. The poet, Robert Frost, through this poem asserts the importance of the right decision at the right time.
          </p>
          <p>
           In life, we have to make our choices; sometimes we have to make these choices without the full understanding of the State of affairs. Even then, we should arrive at decision only after carefully considering all the available options. We may regret our choice or we may be excited about our choice, but the choice at the crucial moment will determine and change the path of our life. Hence, the poem stresses the need for deep and critical analysis of the situation before we arrive at a life-transforming decision.

          <p>
           (B) “Guru was a wise man” – how does the story The Kingdom of fools reflect it?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Kingdom of Fools clearly reflects that the Guru was a wise man as he advised his disciple not to stay in that kingdom. As the disciple thought that the ftiture is uncertain, he did not pay any heed to his Guru and stayed on. When he was imprisoned by the King’s men, he realised the significance of his Guru’s words and repented on his decision of not following his Guru’s advice. So, it is proved that Guru was really very wise. And it was because of his wisdom, the disciple was saved and they were made king and prime minister of the kingdom respectively.
