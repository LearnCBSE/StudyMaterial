           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below: 12
           <br/>
           Donated Organs and their Transportation
           <br/>
           1. Once an organ donor’s family gives its consent and the organs are matched to a recipient, medical professionals are faced with the onerous challenge of transporting organs while ensuring that the harvested organ reaches its destination in the shortest possible time. This is done in order to preserve the harvested organs and involves the police and especially the traffic police department.
          </p>
          <p>
           2. The traditional method of transporting organs by road is referred to as a “green corridor”. This process entails police escorting an ambulance, so as to move around traffic – usually a specific traffic lane is chosen and all signals on the route stay green to ensure it to reach its destination in the shortest possible time. A ‘green corridor’ is a route cleared and cordoned off by the traffic police to ensure the smooth and steady transportation of harvested organs, on most occasions, to those awaiting a life-saving transplant. Organs tend to have a very short preservation time, such as the heart which has to be harvested and transplanted within four hours or the lungs which can be preserved for only six hours once they are harvested.
          </p>
          <p>
           3. The first green corridor in India was created by Chennai Traffic Police in September 2008 when they accomplished their task of enabling an ambulance to reach its destination within 11 minutes during peak hour traffic. That organ saved a nine-year-old girl whose life depended on the transplant.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           4. Similarly, such green corridors have been created by traffic police of various cities such as Pune, Mumbai, Delhi NCR etc. Personnel are stationed at selected points to divert, control and clear the traffic giving way to the ambulance. Apart from this, a motorcade of police vehicles accompanies the ambulance ensuring that it does not face any problems. Delhi Traffic Police provided a green corridor from IGI Airport to Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences in Vasant Kunj for transportation of a liver. The distance of 14 kms was covered in 11 minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
           5. Experts point out the lack of a robust system to transport organs to super-speciality hospitals in least possible time. National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO), the country’s apex orgarf”donation agency, is now framing a proposal to airlift cadaver organs and will send a report to the Union Health Ministry. “Cadaver organs have a short life and so transplant should be done within a few golden hours, “Director (NOTTO) expressed, “Therefore, we are preparing a proposal for airlifting organs at any given moment.”
          </p>
          <p>
           6. Most states do not have enough well-trained experts to retrieve or perform transplant procedures. Also, there is an acute shortage of advanced healthcare facilities to carry out a transplant. So, it is referred to other big centres in metropolitan cities. Organs retrieved from Aurangabad, Indore, Surat, Pune are sent to Mumbai as these cities do not have super-speciality healthcare centres, informed officials.
          </p>
          <p>
           7. “In India, about fifty thousand to one lakh patients are suffering from acute heart failure and need heart transplant at any point of time. In a private set-up, a heart transplant costs ₹15-20 lakhs, which is followed up by postoperative medication of about T30,000 per month lifelong.”

          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Read the following passage: [8]
          </p>
          <p>
           1. How does television affect our lives? It can be very helpful to people who carefully choose the shows that they watch. Television can increase our knowledge of the outside world; there are high-quality programmes that help us understand many fields of study, science, medicine, the different arts and so op. Moreover, television benefits very old people, who can’t leave the house, as well as patients in hospitals. It also offers non-native speakers the advantages of daily informal language practice. They can increase their vocabulary and practice listening.
          </p>
          <p>
           2. On the other hand, there are several serious disadvantages of television, of course, it provides us with a pleasant way to relax and spend our free time, but in some countries people watch television for an average of six hours or more a day. Many children stare at the TV screen for more hours a day than they spend on anything else, including studying and sleeping. It’s clear that TV has a powerful influence on their lives and that its influence is often negative.
          </p>
          <p>
           3. Recent studies show that after only thirty seconds of television viewing, a person’s brain ‘relaxes’ the same way that it does just before the person falls asleep. Another effect of television on the human brain is that it seems to cause poor concentration. Children who view a lot of television can often concentrate on a subject for only fifteen to twenty minutes. They can pay attention only for the amount of time between commercials.
          </p>
          <p>
           4. Another disadvantage is that television often causes people to become dissatisfied with their own lives. Real life does not seem so exciting to these people. To many people, television becomes more real than reality and their own lives seem boring. Also many people get upset or depressed when they can’t solve problems in real life as quickly as television actors seem to.
          </p>
          <p>
           5. Before a child is fourteen years old, he or she views eleven thousand murders on the TV’. He or she begins to believe that there is nothing strange about fights, killings and other kinds of violence. Many studies show that people become more violent after viewing certain programmes. They may even do the things that they see in a violent show.
          </p>

           (b) Summary: Television has both positive and negative impacts on our lives. If we choose carefully the shows we watch, it can increase our knowledge on a variety of subjects. It entertains old people and patients in hospitals. But it has serious disadvantages also especially among children who neglect their studies, compromise on their sleep and lose concentration when they get glued to the television. Adults too become dissatisfied because real life is not as exciting as reel life. Television shows encourage violence because children feel it is quite normal and there is nothing strange about it.

           Sir
           <br/>
           Through the medium of the columns of your esteemed newspaper I wish to highlight the need to tap the sports talent at a young age so that it does not go unrecognized.
           <br/>
           This can be done at the school level itself by the sports teachers and coaches. They can closely monitor the aptitude and skills a child possesses for a particular sport and groom him accordingly. To realize the full potential of a child needs the complete commitment on the part of the students and the encouragement and guidance of the teachers and the parents who need to understand the value of pursuing a sport diligently.
           <br/>
           By grooming children and tapping their sports talent from a young age, we shall have a large pool of young and talented sports persons. With this intention the government of India has formulated a talent identification programme, The National Sports Talent Search Scheme. The need of the present times is to create good infrastructure for sports and nurture talent from an early age.
           <br/>
           I hope you will publish my letter in your newspaper so that public awareness can be created in this matter.
           <br/>

           Question 5.
           <br/>
           ‘No detention policy for classes sixth to eighth is academically very unsound.’ Write a debate in 150-200 ivords either for or against the motion. [10]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The policy of no detention till Class VIII has had a delirious impact on the learning outcome in schools. There is little check on the fact that whether or not a student has even acquired bare minimum knowledge before he or she is promoted to the next class. Good Morning Everyone, I …….., have come to speak in favour of the motion, ‘The policy of no detention till class VIII is not in the interest of students’.
           <br/>
           The situation often arises wherein students do not fail till Class VIII and then do not pass in class IX. The poor results of this policy are visible in Class IX. I feel this policy is resulting in a decline in the standard of education. Children are showing a lackadaisical attitude towards their studies. The basic drive to excel is missing in students as a result of such leniency. Parents are also less concerned as they are sure their wards will not be held back in the class even if they do not fare well. Students do not work as hard as they should and take their studies for granted. Though this policy was implemented with the objective of reducing stress on children, one cannot ignore the fact that the quality of education has to be maintained and the aim of education has to be achieved. Children with weak foundation reach Class IX, and are unable to perform in higher classes as their basics are not clear. It is thus a serious concern that all attempts of educating children upto Class VIII is proving to be a waste in terms of time and money.
           <br/>
           Life in general is extremely competitive, so let us not forget a little bit of pressure is always beneficial in the long run so there is certainly an urgent need to rethink about continuing this policy.

           Good morning Respected Principal Ma’am, Teachers and Dear Friends!
           <br/>
           As per the last census, the literacy rate in India was around 74 percent. But in our day-to¬day life we come across people who can neither read nor write. Seeing the gravity of the situation, I, Vinitha have come before you all to speak on the topic, “Each One, Teach One.’ Illiteracy is still a major blot on India, even after more than seventy years of our achieving independence. The removal of illiteracy needs to be tackled on a priority’ basis and we students can play an important role in achieving this target. Since we ourselves are in the process of receiving education, we are in the best position to extend our services to educate the illiterate people.
           <br/>
           It is we ‘students who need to carry forth the lamp of knowledge by participating in events like, “Each One, Teach One’. If each one of us resolves to teach an illiterate person during the vacations or whenever we get time, we will do our bit to eradicate illiteracy in the long run. If we all get together in the move to educate people, that day is not far when India will join the league of nations who have attained full literacy rate.
           <br/>
           To conclude, I would like to say that if the Each One, Teach One initiative is taken up by us we will be contributing our bit towards eliminating illiteracy.
           <br/>

           A programme on ‘Swachh Bharat Mission’ was organized in our school on Mahatma Gandhi’s birthday. The aim of this event was an effort on the part of our school to contribute our bit towards the vision of ‘Clean India’ as initiated by our Prime Minister. Students prepared posters and pasted them in the colony near our school. They also prepared placards which they carried when a procession was taken out. Our school premises and the adjacent colony were cleaned by the students and our teachers. The public was also advised by student volunteers to make this mission successful. Eminent environmentalists also graced this event with their presence and reiterated the importance of cleanliness, which is also essential for the environmental development. Our Principal too expressed her views towards our moral responsibility to keep our surroundings clean. Each time we cannot shrug off our shoulders and curse the government and the civic authorities for the litter and dirt around us. It is high time we ensure the use of dustbins and make sure that we do not strew litter.

           The Word ‘father’ is synonymous with strict discipline etc. but it is not completely true. The father fulfills his responsibilities affectionately for the family. Write an article in 150-200 words on the topic, ‘Role of father in the family’. You are Dhruv/Deepa.

           Role of Father in the Family
           <br/>
           By: Deepa/Dhruv
           <br/>
           The Word ‘father’ is synonymous with someone who is a strict disciplinarian, but this is not completely true. The father is also a person who fulfills his responsibilities, affectionately for his family.
           <br/>
           Fathers are usually looked up as providers and protectors of the family. It is observed that children who lack a father’s presence in their life do not possess a sense of emotional strength, a feeling of security and self-esteem and decision-making skills. These are the kind of qualities that come from a father’s active presence.
           <br/>
           Moreover, children who perceive their’father as supportive feel a greater sense of social acceptance and psychological development. Fathers introduce their children to a wider variety7 of methods in dealing with the challenges of life and also teach them the objectivity and consequences of choosing between right and wrong. He is the pillar of strength and support and a great role model for his children.
           <br/>
           Thus, a father is generally every boy’s biggest hero and every girl’s first love. No wonder, evety boy wants to grow up to be like his father and every girl hopes to meet someone who would be even half as wonderful as her father.

           Why did the Crofter repose confidence in the peddler? How did the peddler feel after betraying the Crofter?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           One dark evening when the peddler was walking along the road he knocked on the door of a cottage to seek shelter for the night. To his surprise, he was welcomed by an old man, the crofter, who lived alone in the cottage. The lonely Crofter was happy to find a man whom he could talk to. He served the peddler supper, gave him tobacco and played a game of cards with him. The old crofter then went to the window and took down a leather pouch. He counted three ten kronor notes and put them into the pouch. This provided a big bait for the peddler who was tempted to steal the notes. He stole the money and thus committed a breach of trust. So he betrayed the confidence reposed in him by his host. As the peddler walked along with the crofter’s money in his pocket, he felt quite pleased with his own smartness. He realised that he could not dare to continue with his journey on the public highway and so he turned off the road, into woods.

           Educating children is the responsibility of society. Justify the statement in view of ‘The Last Lesson.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           It is the responsibility of society to educate children. This statement is aptly justified by the chapter, The Last Lesson wherein M- Hamel reproaches and blames the society, including himself, for the lack of learning on part of the students. When Frank gets mixed up in saying the rule of the participle, Mr Haprel tells him that he will not scold him for putting off learning till the next day as they all had a great deal to reproach themselves with. Their parents were not anxious enough to have them learn the language. They preferred to put them to work to earn extra monev. He himself had often sent them to water his flowers instead of making them learn their lessons and had given them a holiday when he wanted to go fishing. So they, as a society, had been irresponsible in ensuring education of the children.

           <br/>
           What was the prediction of the astrologers regarding the ultimate fate of the Tiger King? How did it come to be true? Describe with reference to the story.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Maharaja of Pratibandapuram, who was also known as the Tiger King tried to go against what was destined in his fate. The result was tragic and ironical. The chief astrologer had predicted that a tiger would be the cause of the king’s death and he should specially be wary of the hundredth tiger. The vain king banned hunting of the tigers in the State by everyone except himself and was able to kill ninety-nine tigers. He thought he had killed the hundredth tiger also but somehow the bullet missed its mark and the hundredth tiger survived. Then, on his son’s birthday the king bought him a wooden tiger which he felt was a perfect gift for his son. One sharp tiny sliver of the wooden tiger pierced the king’s right hand and the infection spread all over his arm causing his death. It was indeed ironical that despite killing all the tigers in his kingdom the king did finally become the victim of the hundredth tiger and the astrologer’s prediction did come true.

           What are phytoplankton? How are they important to our ecosystem? (Journey to the End of the Earth)
           <br/>
           Ans. The microscopic phytoplankton are tiny forms of plant life on the sea. They nourish and sustain the entire southern ocean’s food chain. They are single-celled plants and use the energy of the sun to assimilate carbon supplying oxygen and synthesis compounds. Depletion of the ozone layer that protects us from the harmful rays of the sun adversely affects the activities of the phytoplankton. Any further depletion in the ozone layer will hamper their activity which, in turn, is bound to affect the growth of marine animals and birds and even the global carbon cycle. Thus to save the big organisms, the small organisms need to be cared for because even minor changes have huge repercussions.

The only solution seems to be that people start using public transport. Write an article in 150-200 words on the topic, ‘Importance of Public Transport’. You are Sanjith/ Ranjitha. [6]

           The importance of Public Transport
           <br/>
           By: Ranjitha
           <br/>
           Increase in: the number of private vehicles in the last two decades has led to an unprecedented rise in air pollution, traffic jams, lack of parking space, road rage, etc. One of the solutions to this problem lies in the use of public transport.
           <br/>
           Use of public transport reduces travel by private vehicles. Public transport is beneficial as it not only eases congestion on roads but also saves fuel, money and energy. When people use public transport they reduce their carbon footprint and conserve energy by eliminating travel that would otherwise have been made in a private vehicle. It also gives people energy, efficient choices and reduces overall greenhouse gas emissions without reducing the mobility that is so vital to our nation’s economic growth. To encourage more people to use public transport the authorities need to improve local train and bus services. Funds need to be allocated to make public transport services accessible and more reliable. A bus with as few as 7-8 passengers is more fuel efficient than an average single occupant car. The recent odd-even rule for cars started by Chief Minister of Delhi was initiated to encourage the use of public transport and thereby reduce pollution caused by traffic. The authorities are working hard to make public more aware of how useful, efficient and less damaging to the environment the use of public transport is.

           Teachers’ day was celebrated in our school on 5th September. It was an effort on the part of our school management to make our teachers feel special on this day (also the occasion of Dr. S Radhakrishnan’s birthday) for their valuable contribution to the society.
           <br/>
           The function was presided over by the State Education Minister, Mr. Sandeep Kumar. A cultural function of song and dance was organized by the students, much to the delight of our teachers. The highlight of the programme was that five of our retired teachers were specially invited for this occasion and were honoured for their exemplary services. Thereafter, the Chief Guest gave a speech wherein he spoke about the noble profession of teaching and thanked the teachers for their valuable contribution in building the future of our nation. Our Principal gave a vote of thanks, expressing her gratitude to the Chief Guest for his presence and to the teachers for their dedicated services.

Extreme poverty, hard work and dismal working conditions result in the loss of the childhood of children who are in this profession. The working conditions of all bangle-makers are pathetic and miserable. They work in high temperature, badly lit and poorly ventilated glass furnaces due to which child workers especially are at risk of losing their eyesight at an early age. The stinking lanes of Ferozabad are choked with garbage and humans and animals live together in these hovels. There is no development or progress in their lives with the passage of time. They have no choice but to work in these inhuman conditions. Mind-numbing toil kills their dreams and hopes.

Everyone in the class set to work quietly and with enthusiasm, regretting their earlier indifference towards their language.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           Gandhiji took up the cause of the indigo sharecroppers at Champaran. He fought against the injustice of the cruel British landlords who extorted money from the poor sharecroppers. Gandhiji collected all the facts and met the Commissioner. The commissioner tried to threaten Gandhiji and advised him to leave from there. But Gandhiji was undeterred. He decided to launch a peaceful ‘satyagraha’ and non-violent movement. This led to spontaneous demonstrations in Motihari. Thousands of peasants challenged the Britishers and the government was baffled. Despite earlier hesitations, the prominent lawyers declared their unconditional support to Gandhiji. Finally, Gandhiji’s peaceful and non-violent civil disobedience bore the desired results. The indigo share-croppers at Champaran secured justice and the landlords agreed to refund 25 per cent of the compensation money.

           <br/>
           These recent floods have led to great loss of life and property. Almost three hundred people have lost their lives and thousands have been rendered homeless. To carry out the relief operations several teams of the Disaster Rapid Action Force along with the Fire Brigade personnel were heavily deployed in the affected areas. More than ten thousand people were evacuated from the low-lying areas of our town and relocated to safe-shelters where many NGOs came forward to help the victims with food and medicine. Infact, it was heartening to see that the entire nation came forward to help the people affected by the floods.

           Teachers are regarded as nation builders. They are responsible for not only educating the children but also for developing their character and transforming them into responsible citizens.
           <br/>
           Teachers’ role in society is both valuable and significant. They play an important role in shaping the future of the country so they can be called the custodians and architects of our future. Teachers are mentors and guides who work with a vision and passion to build positive and inspired future generations, and thus design society on a local and global scale. Teachers also act as the support system that could sometimes be lacking in a child’s life. They are the ultimate role models for students. Good teachers always have compassion for their students and appreciation for their achievements. Through their encouragement they increase the productivity and creativity of their students.
           <br/>
           Teaching is referred to as a noble profession and teachers are truly the backbone of the society. We must always be grateful to our teachers who have given a positive and well meaning definition to our life.

           (a) Rudyard Kipling disliked being interviewed because he considered it immoral, a crime and an assault which needed to be punished. He even regarded interview as being cowardly and vile and felt no respectable man should give an interview or ask for it.

          <p>
           (b) Danny Casey is an Irish football prodigy and Sophie is attracted to him because like most youngsters she idolizes and hero-worships him. So she envisions her meetings with the football star and also gives vivid details of their meetings.
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) Even though Saheb is paid 800 rupees and gets all his meals, he does not like working at the tea stall. He has lost his carefree look because he is no longer his own master. The steel canister Saheb carries seems heavier than the plastic bag that he would carry so highly over his shoulders as a ragpicker. The bag was his own whereas the canister belongs to someone else.

           (d) The colour of ‘sour-cream’ is an off-white or a pale yellow. The poet has used this to describe the worn classroom walls in order to highlight its neglect. The sour-cream colour of the wall echoes the equally neglected state of the children whose lives are confined within these walls.

           (e) Dr. Sadao was a skilled and reputed surgeon who was in the process of perfecting an invention of rendering wounds totally clean. Moreover, he was treating the old General who could need an ‘operation. So he was not sent to the battlefield as his valuable services could be needed at any time in his hometown.

           (f) The landlord’s man asked BamaVbrother on which street he lived in order to find out his caste. During those times, when untouchability was prevalent, each caste lived in a particular street and by inquiring about the street where one lived, helped to determine his caste.

           (g) Evans was determined to make his escape-plan a success and so he had clipped his hair short ‘to pass off as McLeery later. Jackson dis-approved of his dirty “bobble ‘ hat” and asked him to remove it. Evans immediately thought of a ploy to avoid recognition by telling Jackson that the hat had always brought him good luck. So the police officer agreed to his request.

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Answer the following question in 120-150 words: [6]
           <br/>
           The play ‘On The Face of It’ depicts the unusual behaviour of the people towards the physically disabled which makes them feel lonely. Comment.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The lesson ‘On the Face of It’ aptly depicts the loneliness and sense of alienation experienced by Derry and Mr. Lamb on account of a disability.
           <br/>
           The bond that unites Mr. Lamb and Derry is the loneliness and alienation they experience on account of their physical disabilities. Mr Lamb lost a leg in the war and has a tin leg while Derry has an acid burn on one cheek which gives him an ugly appearance. The actual pain and inconvenience caused by a disability is often much less than the sense of estrangement and alienation felt by a disabled person. But, unlike Derry, Mr. Lamb always maintains a positive attitude towards life and is a downright extrovert.
           <br/>
           Mr. Lamb inspires Derry by telling him not to focus on the shortcomings of life and his handicap and instead he should try to enjoy the blessings of life. He tells him to be thankful to God for two arms, two legs, two eyes and ears, a tongue and a brain and advises him to be friendly with everyone around him.
           <br/>
           Mr. Lamb’s inexplicable words of wisdom inspire Derry and towards the end of the story we see him rushing back to Mr. Lamb’s garden to adopt the attitude and path that have been shown by him. Derry’s long conversation with Mr. Lamb helps him overcome his inferiority complex and poor self-esteem.
           <br/>

           <br/>
           If we want to study and examine the Earth’s past, present and future, Antarctica is the place to go to. Comment.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A visit to Antarctica will help us to understand where we have come from and where we could possibly be heading. It will also suggest a lot of future possibilities, probably for even a million years later. By visiting Antarctica we get an opportunity to study about the future climatic changes easily and more effectively. We also come to know about the repercussions of the various environmental changes. It also gives us the realization of the appearance of the ‘future world’. The ice-cores of Antarctica hold more than half-million- year-old carbon records which are very crucial for the study of the past, present and future of our planet. All this will also help us to understand our planet better and also give qs ideas to save our planet.
