           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below carefully:
           <br/>
           1. ‘Overpowering prey is a challenge for creatures that do not have limbs’. Some species like Russell’s viper inject poison. Some others opt for an alternative nonchemical method – rat snakes, for instance, catch and push their prey against the ground, while pythons use their muscle power to crush their prey to death. But snakes can’t be neatly divided into poisonous and non-poisonous categories.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           2. Even species listed as non-poisonous aren’t completely free of poison. The common Sand Boa, for instance, produces secretions particularly poisonous to birds. So the species doesn’t take any chance — it crushes its prey and injects poison as an extra step.
          </p>
          <p>
           3. Do vipers need poison powerful enough to kill hundreds of rats with just one drop? After all, they eat only one or two at a time.
          </p>
          <p>
           4. While hunting animals try their worst to kill most efficiently, their prey use any trick to avoid becoming a meal, such as developing immunity to poison. For instance Californian ground squirrels are resistant to Northern Pacific rattlesnake poison.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           5. Competition with prey is not the only thing driving snakes to evolve more and more deadly poison. Snakes also struggle to avoid becoming prey themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
           6. Some snake killers have partial immunity to poison. Famously, mongooses are highly resistant to cobra poison, and with their speed and agility, kill snakes fearlessly. It would be the death of cobras as a species if they didn’t evolve a more deadly poison to stop mongooses.
          </p>
          <p>
           7. Poison has another important role. It’s an extreme meat softener; specific enzymes break up the insides of the prey. Normally, a reptile depends on the sun’s warm rays to aid digestion.
          </p>
          <p>
           8. But I wonder if we cannot use venom in our favour. In remote parts of India, local hospitality often involves leather-tough meat. I chew and chew until my jaws ache. If I spit it out or refuse, our hosts would be offended, I swallow like a python stuffing a deer down its throat and hope I don’t choke. If only I had poison.
          </p>
          <p>
           1.1 On the basis of your understanding of the above passage answer the following questions: (any four) 2 × 4 = 8
           <br/>
           (a) Russell viper and rat snake have different methods to attack prey. How?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           To attack its prey, Russell viper injects poison, whereas rat snakes opt for an alternative non-chemical method, they catch and push their prey against the ground.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           (b) How does Sand Boa kill its prey?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The common Sand Boa produces secretion’s particularly poisonous to birds. It crushes it prey and injects poison as an extra step.
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) There is a constant tussle between the hunting animal and its prey? Why?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Hunting animals try their worst to kill most efficiently but their prey use any trick to avoid becoming a meal, such as developing immunity to poison. For example, Californian ground squirrels are resistant to Northern Pacific rattlesnake poison. Snakes also struggle to avoid becoming prey themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
           (d) What makes mongoose a snake predator?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Mongoose are highly resistant to cobra poison and kill snakes fearlessly with their speed and agility.
          </p>
          <p>
           (e) What difficulty does the writer face when he is entertained in the remote parts of India?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In remote parts of India, local hospitality often involves leather tough meat. The writer has to chew this meat till his jaw starts to ache. If he spits it out or refuses, his hosts would be offended. He swallows like a python stuffing a deer down its throat and hopes he doesn’t choke.
          </p>
          <p>
           1.2 On the basis of your reading of the above passage fill in any two of the following blanks. 1 × 2 = 2

           Sir,
           <br/>
           Through the medium of your esteemed newspaper, I wish to express my concern about the increasing attacks on old people living alone.
          </p>
          <p>
           With the joint family system gradually disintegrating in India and nuclear set-up of families becoming the order of the day, old people are unfortunately left on their own. They are left to paid services as their near and dear ones do not have time for them. This makes them vulnerable to attacks by miscreants. Sometimes they have to pay for this by their life. Old people are left to battle problems of loneliness, depression and solitude.
          </p>
          <p>
           Society as a whole must be sensitive towards the elderly and care for them. Old people living alone must have their caretaker’s and helpers’ identity verified by the police. CCTV cameras and alarm systems should be installed at strategic places in homes and localities to increase security. Their must also be regular patrolling to instill fear among the miscreants and confidence among the elderly. Elders are an integral part of our culture and traditions and we as a society must be tender and loving towards their needs.
          </p>
          <p>
           Through the columns of your esteemed newspaper I would like to sensitivise the people towards this problem and also appeal to the concerned authorities to ensure such attacks do not take place.
          </p>

           Sir
           <br/>
           Through the medium of this letter I would like to draw your attention to the problem of irregular drinking water supply which the residents of M.G. Road are facing. Since there is irregular supply of drinking water supplied through taps we are forced to spend a substantial amount of money every month on buying drinking water from the market. This undue but necessary expenditure is hard-hitting for all of us, especially the people of the low-income group. They undergo a major financial burden arising out of this expenditure and the municipal authority has turned a blind eye and a deaf ear to their woes. I, once again, would like to request you to ensure immediate corrective measures wherein the residents get a regular supply of drinking water.
          </p>
          <p>
           I hope you will take serious view of this matter and implement corrective measures with immediate effect.
          </p>

           [B] Read the following excerpt from an article that appeared in the magazine section of a local daily.
           <br/>
           Consumerism is increasing day by day. Luxuries of yesterday have become necessities of today. The result is that the more we want the more miserable we become.
           <br/>
           Write a paragraph to analyse the given argument.
           <br/>
           You could think about what alternative explanations might weaken the given conclusion and include rationale/evidence that would strengthen/counter the given argument. 8
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           [A] It is evident from the chart that Get News is one of the most popular internet activity carried out by most age groups of people in Rampur. With a high of 76% among teenagers and a low of 70% by people who are over 70 years of age. Online games are played by 81% teenagers and as people grow older their interest in these games decreases. The concept of downloading is rather low among the older people and the younger age groups also do not download much stuff. Teenagers do not carry out product research on the internet but the percentage is high among the people who are in their 20s to 70s. The percentage of people who buy online products does not exceed 70 and a rather low percentage of all age groups search for people through the internet.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           [B] Consumerism is increasing day by day. We all are materialistic to some extent. The result is we want more and more and feel miserable when we do not get all that we need. The greed to have more becomes an obstacle when we start allowing material things to control us. Excessive desire for things is anyway considered immoral, a violation of natural or divine law. When this greed to have more than we actually need starts growing strong, we become utterly fixated on seeking what we do not actually need and try to get hold of those things that will still not help to eliminate the deep rooted evil of not having enough. When we learn to control our needs we not only minimize our sufferings and pain but are able to be at peace with ourselves and be happy and appreciate the little things that have been bestowed on us.

           <br/>
           Answer the following questions in 30 – 40 words each. 2 × 5 = 10
           <br/>
           (a) How did Kisa Gotami realise that life and death is a normal process?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Kisa Gotami went to Buddha to get medicine that would cure her son. Buddha told her to procure a handful of mustard-seeds, which must be taken from a house where no one had lost any close relative or friend. Kisa Gotami then went from house to house but there was not a single house where some loved one had not died. She became weary and hopeless and was unable to fulfill Buddha’s request.
          </p>
          <p>
           When Kisa Gotami got tired and depressed for not getting the mustard seeds as per condition, she sat down at the wayside and watched the flickering lights of the city that extinguished soon. It was then that the understanding dawned on her that the life of human beings also flickers then dies. Death is inevitable for all, those who are born have to die and so one must not grieve over it.

           (b) What guesses did the Londoners make about what Mij was?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The common people of London did not recognise an otter and made a variety of guesses as to what kind of animal Mij was. These guesses at times even surprised the writer. People thought he belonged to the group of animals called Mustellines which included badger, weasel, mongoose, stoat, mink and others. More random guesses were of a baby seal, a squirrel or even a walrus. Once outside a dog show people guessed him to be even a hippo. Mij was anything for them but an otter.

           <br/>
           The crew of the space probe after arriving on Earth took shelter in a square place but had no idea about it. It was actually a public library which they thought was a storage barn.

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Answer the following questions in about 100 – 150 words. 8
           <br/>
           Bholi is a child different from others. This difference makes her an object of neglect and laughter. Elaborate.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           People should always try to live within their means. Aspirations have no limits but one should never forget the ground realities. Elaborate on the basis of chapter, “The Necklace”.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Bholi was the youngest of the seven of Randal’s children. All the children except Bholi were healthy and strong. Bholi had remained a backward child and her entire body was disfigured due to an attack of small pox at the age of two. She stammered when she spoke. Ramlal and his wife were never in favour of her being sent to school. But still they sent her to school thinking that since she had little chance of getting married with her ugly face and lack of sense, it would be better to let the teachers at school worry about her.
          </p>
          <p>
           They had never got new clothes made for Bholi. The old dresses of her sisters were passed on to her. No one cared to mend or wash her clothes. For her parents, Bholi was a burden for whom they never bothered to even care. Her parent’s attitude towards her was very hostile. When Bholi first went to school, she did know what exactly a school was and what happened there, but when she saw girls like her present there, she was glad. She hoped that one of those girls would become her friend. In the class when her teacher asked her name, she tried to say it but the girls started laughing when she stammered. She cried and kept her head down throughout the class.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Matilda suffered because she was a discontented woman who lacked courage to speak the truth. If Matilda had been truthful with Mme Forestier she could have known then that the diamonds, were false and would not have gone ahead and replaced them with real diamonds that cost her ruin. Had Matilda lived within her own means she could have saved herself and her husband from all the misery. Aspirations have no limits. One should never forget the grounded realities. Running after materialistic world only brings us sorrow. We must cut our pocket according to our cloth. The real happiness of life lies in simple living and high thinking.

           Question 11.
           <br/>
           Answer the following questions in about 100 – 150 words. 8
           <br/>
           The poet in the poem, ‘For Anne Gregory’ conveys that we should give importance to the inner beauty and not to the physical appearance. Elaborate with reference to the poem.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           How does the poet describe the moon: (a) at the beginning of the third stanza, and (b) at its end? What causes this change? What happens to the house when the trees move out of it?Why do you think the poet does not mention “the departure of the forest from the house” in her letters?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The poem ‘For Anne Gregory’ is based on the conversation between a young woman and a young man. She wants to be loved for herself alone and not for her hair and physical appearance. The man remarks that he would never love her alone but his love was for her yellow hair. To this the woman says that she could colour her hair brown, black or carroty with different hair dyes. The poem conveys that the young men give more importance to the physical appearance than spiritual beauty. The woman further says that an old religious man found a text which proves that for God colours do not matter for love.
          </p>
          <p>
           The poet suggest that God loves you not only for your uniqueness but for what qualities you possess. Only God has this ability to love you for your qualities as a human being and not for your physical appearance. The poet conveys the message that love should be unconditional and should not depend on physical appearance. Young men may love women based on their beauty but God alone is the only one who loves all human beings for who they are.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Initially the moon is whole and shines in an open and clear sky. Later the full moon is broken like a mirror and its pieces are flashing on the top of the tallest oak tree. The change is caused by the trees, which are moving out into the forest. There are cracks in the veranda floor of the house as the roots of the trees work to disengage themselves from the cracks in the floor. The leaves break the glass as they strain themselves towards the glass in an attempt to move forward. The poet does not mention ‘the departure of the forest from the house’ to suggest that plants and trees are used for interior decoration’ in cities, while forest, are cut down, are imprisoned and need to ‘break out’. ‘The poet also wants to highlight that we are often silent about important happenings that are unexpected, as they embarrass us.

           It is heartening to see that the number of students in our computer classes has been on a rapid increase ever since we set-up the computer lab in our school in April, 2018.
          </p>

           [B] Read the following excerpt from an article that appeared in the local daily.
           <br/>
           Our large population is not a cause of poverty but an asset, a resource.
           <br/>
           Write a paragraph to analyse the given argument.
           <br/>
           You could think about what alternative explanations might weaken the given conclusion and include rationale/ evidence that would strengthen/counter the given argument. 8
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           [A] The pie chart displays seven different categories of people living in poverty in Indonesia in 2004. It is seen that the largest majority of people who were living in poverty are the sole parents who comprise 26% closely followed by single people comprising 24%. Couples with children who live in poverty are 15% as compared to 9% couples who are without children. The aged couples and the single aged people account for 5% and 7% respectively of those who lead a life of poverty. Overall 14% of all households in Indonesia were living in poverty in the year 2004. It is thus, evident that 50% of people living in poverty are either single without children or sole parents.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           [B] The people are the greatest resource of a country. This saying is as old as it is true. It is how a country uses this resource to its advantage that determines how citizens become the true assets of the country.
          </p>
          <p>
           Population is not a problem but mismanagement definitely is. If we channelize our population in the right way, then it will surely be an asset. Though our rapid population growth is a matter of concern for our economy and priority needs to be given to measures to control population. It is now up to us how we can use our large population to our country’s advantage. India has the youngest population in the world with mean age of 24 years, in a pretty fast ageing globe. Our large population with its striking diversity that is not seen in the stark homogeneity of China’s population offers us and the world a variety of skills and professions.

          <p>
           Through the columns of your reputed daily, I want to express my views on Delhi — the city of my dreams. It is a matter of great pride for me that I live in Delhi, the capital of India. It is a metropolitan city. The city boasts of rich historical culture. The architecture of its historical monuments, museums, structures like Parliament House, Rashtrapati Bhawan, Red Fort, India Gate, Qutub Minar is exquisite and these are world renowned tourist sights.
          </p>
          <p>
           Delhi’s beautiful parks and shopping malls are a shopper’s delight. Delhi Haat keeps the traditional handicrafts culture alive. Delhi is a big city with towering buildings and has a great network of roads and flyovers. We also have a world-class metro facility to make commuting faster and comfortable. To Delhi’s credit we also have the top universities and schools of the country.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is the love for my city that I am also viewing my concerns towards Delhi earning the notoriety of being the crime capital of India. Delhi, popular for being a city of warm-hearted people has been misused by wrong-doers. Morally, materially and environmentally the city has been mistreated. It is a pity that people do not care about this city of ours. We all need to take a pledge to live up to the glory of the capital city, make the city green, clean and law-abiding. Delhi is the pride of the nation and I dream of it becoming a world class city one day

           Sir
           <br/>
           Our village Gopalpur is along National Highway No. 12 in district Ramnagar. The state roadways buses pass our village but do not stop here.
          </p>
          <p>
           On behalf of the residents of our village it is my request to you that our village be provided with a bus stop. Many people from our village are daily commuters who work in district Ramnagar. It would be very convenient for them to have a bus stop in our village. As for now the nearest bus stop for state roadways buses is about five kilometres away from our village and it is rather difficult to get any public transport to reach our village. Moreover, safety of our villagers, is a major concern. As there are no streetlights, people have to walk back 5 kms in the dark to get back to the village.
          </p>
          <p>
           Keeping these problems in mind, I sincerely hope that you will ensure our village gets a bus stop. Since our village is along the highway there will be no diversion of route for the state roadways buses. Awaiting an early favourable response from your end.
          </p>

           [B] Read the following excerpt from an article that appeared in a local daily.
           <br/>
           The policy of no detention fill Class VIII is not in the interest of students.
           <br/>
           Write a paragraph to analyse the given argument.

           <br/>
           and include rationale/evidence that would strengthen/counter the given argument. 8
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           [A] The graph shows that the number of daily new COVID-19 cases had been decreasing in Bihar since July after touching a peak of 3,500 new cases on a weekly average basis in July. The cases had peaked to 17% in the month of July and thereafter have been showing a steady decline. The steady spike in the number of cases was seen from the middle of June to the middle of July. And earlier hike of a little over 2,000 cases a week was witnessed in the middle of May, after which there was a decrease in the number of cases till the end of June. But since then the covid cases have been rising steadily. In the past almost three months Bihar has been showing a fall in both the Covid cases and the positivity rate.
           <br/>
           Or,
           <br/>
           [B] The policy of no detention till Class VIII has had a delirious impact on the learning outcome in schools. There is a little check on the facts that whether or not a student has even acquired bare minimum knowledge before he or she is promoted to the next class.
          </p>
          <p>
           The situation often arises wherein students do not fail till Class VIII and then do not pass in Class IX. The poor results of this policy are visible in Class IX. I feel this policy is resulting in a decline in the standard of education. Children are showing a lackadaisical attitude towards their studies. The basic drive to excel is missing in students as a result of such leniency.
          </p>
          <p>
           Students do not work as hard as they should and take their studies for granted. Though this policy was implemented with the objective of reducing stress on children, one cannot ignore the fact that the quality of education has to be maintained and the aim of education has to be achieved.
