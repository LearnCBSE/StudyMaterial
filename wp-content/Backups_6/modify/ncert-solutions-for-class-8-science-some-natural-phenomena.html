           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Sometimes, a crackling sound is heard while taking off a sweater during winters. Explain.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The electric discharge takes place between the body and the sweater due to friction. At the time of electric discharge some energy is released. In this case energy is released in the form of crackling sound.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Explain why a charged body loses its charge if we touch it with our hand.
           <br/>
           Human body is a conductor of electricity. When a charged body is touched with hand, our body conducts its charges to the earth. Hence, by this way charged body loses its charge.

          <p>
           Question 6.
           <br/>
           Name the scale on which the destructive energy of an earthquake is measured. An earthquake measures 3 on this scale. Would it be recorded by a seismograph? Is it likely to cause much damage?
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           The destructive energy of an earthquake is measured on a scale called the Richter Scale.
           <br/>
           Yes, it would be recorded by seismograph because this scale has the readings from 1 to 10. No it is not likely to cause much damage as earthquakes of magnitude higher than 5 is considered destructive in nature.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 7.
           <br/>
           Suggest three measures to protect ourselves from lightning.
           <br/>
           (i) Do not use TV or cable phone during lightning.
           <br/>
           (ii) Stay indoor or under covered area.
           <br/>
           (iii) Don’t take bath during lightning.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 8.
           <br/>
           Explain why a charged balloon is repelled by another charged balloon whereas an uncharged balloon is attracted by another charged balloon?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A charged balloon is repelled by another charged balloon because both carry same type of charges. On the other hand, an uncharged balloon is attracted by another charged balloon as they have opposite charges. We know that same charges repel and opposite charges attract each other.

           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Describe with the help of a diagram an instrument which can be used to detect a charged body.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Electroscope is a device which is used to detect the charge on a body. It works on the principle that like charges repel each other while unlike charges attract each other. It consists of a metal rod with thin metal strip or leaf attached to it at the bottom.
           <br/>
           <img alt="NCERT Solutions for Class 8 Science Chapter 15 Some Natural Phenomena Q9" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-106872" height="254" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Science-Chapter-15-Some-Natural-Phenomena-Q9.png" width="261"/>
           <br/>
           At the top, the metal rod enters in a metallic cup or disc. The bottom of the rod and the metal leaf are enclosed in a glass box for protection. When the disc of the electroscope is touched with a charged ebonite or glass rod, the metal leaves open out or diverge.
           <br/>
           The extent of divergence depends upon the amount of charge on the electroscope. When the metal strips repel each other proves that the body is charged because repulsion is the sure test to detect that body is charged or not through an electroscope.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 10.
           <br/>
           List three states in India where earthquakes are more likely to strike.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Kashmir, Rajasthan and Gujarat.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 11.
           <br/>
           Suppose you are outside your home and an earthquake strikes. What precaution would you take to protect yourself?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           We will take the following precautions to protect ourselves:
           <br/>
           (i) Move to open space. Find a clean spot away from buildings, trees and overhead power lines. Drop to the ground.
           <br/>
           (ii) If we are in a car or a bus, will not come out. Drive slowly to a clear spot and remain in it till the earthquake stops.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 12.
           <br/>
           The weather department has predicted that a thunderstorm is likely to occur on a certain day. Suppose you have to go out on that day. Would you carry an umbrella? Explain.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           No, it is not advisable to carry an umbrella at all. Its metallic objects are more prone to lightning stroke. So an umbrella increases the risk.

          <p>
           Activity 1 (NCERT Textbook, Page 185)
           <br/>
           Jake a used ballpen refill and rub it vigorously with a piece of polythene. Bring it close to small pieces of paper. Take care not to touch the rubbed end of the refill with your hand or with a metallic object. Repeat the activity with small pieces of dry leaf, husk and mustard seeds. Record your observations.
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           When we rub ballpen refill with polythene, it acquires a small electric charge. On bringing the charged ballpen refill close to small pieces of paper, the bits of paper are attracted to it. A charged plastic refill can attract bits of paper.

           <br/>
           Through this activity, it can be concluded that certain objects acquire charge on being rubbed with certain materials. An object possessing charge will attract bits of paper.

           Activity 3 (NCERT Textbook, Page 186)
           <br/>
           (a) Inflate two balloons. Hang them in such a way that they do not touch each other (Fig. 15.1). Rub both the balloons with a woollen cloth and release them. What do you observe?
           <br/>
           Now let us repeat this activity with the used pen refills. Rub one refill with polythene. Place it carefully in a glass tumbler using the tumbler as a stand (Fig. 15.2).

           <br/>
           Rub the other refill also with polythene. Bring it close to the charged refill. Be careful not to touch the charged end with your hand. Is there any effect on the refill in the tumbler? Do the two attract each other, or repel each other?
           <br/>
           In this activity we have brought close together the charged objects that were made of the same material. What happens if two charged objects made of different materials are brought close to each other? Let’s find out.
           <br/>
           (b) Rub a refill and place it gently in a glass tumbler as before (Fig. 15.3). Bring an inflated charged balloon near the refill and observe.

           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           (a) (i) We observed that balloons repelled each other in the first case. Thus, like charges repel each other.
           <br/>
           (ii) In second case, a charged refill repelled another charged refill due to presence of like charges on them.
           <br/>
           (b) A charged balloon attracted a charged refill because balloon had charges opposite to that on a refill. Thus, opposite charges attract each other.

           Activity 4 (NCERT Textbook, Page 187)
           <br/>
           Jake an empty jam bottle. Take a piece of cardboard slightly bigger in size than the mouth of the bottle. Pierce a hole in it so that a metal paper clip can be inserted. Open out the paper clip as shown in Fig. 15.4. Cut two strips of aluminium foil about 4 cm × 1 cm each. Hang them on the paper clip as shown. Insert the paper clip in the cardboard lid so that it is perpendicular to it (Fig. 15.4). Charge a refill and touch it with the end of the paper clip. Observe what happens. Is there any effect on the foil strips? Do they repel each other or attract each other? Now, touch other charged bodies with the end of the paper clip. Do foil strips behave in the same way in all cases? Can this apparatus be used to detect whether a body is charged or not? Can you explain why the foil strips repel each other?

           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           We observed that aluminium foil strips received the same charge from the charged refill through the metal paper clip as it is good conductor of electricity. The strips carrying similar charges repelled each other and they became wide open. Such a device which can be used to test the charge on an object is called electroscope. When we touch the metal paper clip with other charged bodies, the foil strips behave in the same way in all cases. Thus, we find that electrical charges can be transferred from a charged object to another through a metal conductor.

           26th December, 2004. At 8.38 a.m. quake of 6.1 magnitude was felt in Andamans. At 9.00 a.m. as it nears the Chennai coast, the tsunami slowed down but rose higher. This affected India’s South-East coast, predominantly in the state of Tamil Nadu as well as the territories of Andaman and Nicobar Island. Thousands of people died, and the coastal area devastated completely. Many fishing communities were ruined by the tsunami, most notably the fishing town of Nagapattinam. In fact, it was one of the most devastating natural calamaties, people have ever witnessed.

          <ol>
           <li>
            Gold leaves diverge when touched with a charged glass rod because they both acquire similar charge.

           <br/>
           An electroscope is an apparatus to test an electric charge.
           <br/>
           Conclusion: An electroscope has a brass rod passing through a tight fitting cork in a glass bottle. A pair of thin gold leaves are attached to the lower end of the brass rod. To protect the gold leaves from external electric charge the lower half of the bottle is lined with tin foil which is ‘earthed’ by connecting it to the table. This kind of electroscope is called a gold leaf electroscope.
           <br/>
           Working: When a charged rod is touched to the metal disc, the charge is transferred to the gold leaves and they diverge.

           <li>
            The technique to develop quake proof houses has been developed by Central Building Research Institute, Roorkee.
           </li>
           <li>
            The seismic zones are those areas which are prone to earthquakes. They are the areas lying on the boundaries of the plates.
           </li>
           <li>
            (i) The houses in seismic zones should be symmetrical.
            <br/>
            (ii) The foundation of the building should be deep.
            <br/>
            (iii) Roofs should be of light material and the fixtures should be light.
