           Question 1.
           <br/>
           What are the things the child sees on his way to the fair? Why does he lag behind?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           On his way to the fair the child sees toys, balloons of different colours, garland of gulmohur, a swing and a snake-charmer playing a flute. He gets attracted towards all these things. So, he lags behind.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           In the fair he wants many things. What are they? Why does he move on without waiting for an answer?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The child wants many things in the fair. He wants to have toys, different sweets, garland, balloons of different colours and has a keen desire to enjoy the roundabout. He moves on without waiting for an answer because whenever he stops to see things, his parents gave him a cautionary call, “come, child, come!”

           Question 3.
           <br/>
           When does he realise that he has lost his way? How have his anxiety and insecurity been described?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The child sees a roundabout in the fair and gets attracted to it. He wants to have a ride on it. He asks his parents for permission to enjoy it. Having no response on the part of his parents he realises that he has lost his way. He starts crying bitterly at once and runs here and there in search of them.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Why does the lost child lose interest in the things that he had wanted earlier?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The lost child loses interest in the things he had wanted earlier because he got lost in the fair. He is panic-stricken for being lost. Now he frist wants his parents. He is afraid and feels unsafe.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           What do you think happens in the end? Does the child find his parents?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Yes I feel that the child finds his parents at last. The kind-hearted person must have tried his best to find his parents. On the other hand the parents of the child must have left no stone unturned to find their child.

           Question 1.
           <br/>
           How to ensure not to get lost.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           It is very common that children get lost in fairs and crowds. Hardly a day passes when no child gets lost. It is the duty of both the parents and the children to ensure not to get lost. The parents need to be vigilant and more careful at crowded places. Before entering a crowded place the parents should fix a point where the child should wait in case of getting lost. They should make the child memorise home address and telephone numbers. They should put or pin up a note on the pocket of the child with full details. They should attend to the need of the child and never leave him behind, in case he happens to stand at some shop.
          </p>
          <p>
           On the other hand the child should hold the hands of his parents at a crowded place. He should keep an eye on his parents so as not to lose sight of them. In case of any emergency the help of police, help centres and media can be taken.

           Question 1:
           <strong>
            <br/>
           </strong>
           How did the child react when there was no sign of his parents ?
           <strong>
            (Board Term, Sept., 1,2013, K2G41GH)
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <strong>
            <br/>
           </strong>
           The child was very innocent. He gets confused and panic-stricken on not seeing his parents. He felt lonely without his parents amidst so much of crowd. The man who tries to console the child also does not achieve any success as the boy only needs his parents and no monetary benefit.

           <strong>
            <br/>
           </strong>

           Answer:
           <strong>
            <br/>
           </strong>
           A child along with his parents had been to a fair. He was very excited and happy with the stalls of toys and sweets. He gets separated from his parents and starts crying. He runs hither and thither in search of his parents, but in vain. Since the place was overcrowded he got real scared. He started cryjng as he was all alone. A kind hearted man offers him many things but he refuses. The child who wanted everything from the fair was now not interested in any of these things as he only yearned to be with his parents.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <strong>
            <br/>
           </strong>
           Before separation the child was very happy and excited at the fair. He was fascinated with all the things that were displayed at the stalls. He wanted to have all the things like his favourite toys, sweets, flowers, etc. He also wanted to go for a ride. But after separation the boy just wanted to be with his parents. He was not interested in any of those things which he kept longing to have from the stalls. In the absence of his parents these things did not give him any satisfaction.

           Question 3:
           <strong>
            <br/>
           </strong>
           How did the man who found the little boy in the fair, try to soothe him ?
           <strong>
            (Board Term 1,2012, ELI-031)
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <strong>
            <br/>
           </strong>
           The man who found the little boy in the fair tried every possible way to soothe him. He took him to a roundabout swing then offered a horse ride, tried to make him listen to the snake charmer’s song and offered him a balloon, as he thought that this would distract his mind, but in vain. He offered him flowers and sweets, but the child kept crying. The child could not be distracted by any of the things at the fair as he longed to be with his parents.

           Question 4:
           <strong>
            <br/>
           </strong>
           How do you know that the lost child was a nature – lover ?
           <strong>
            (Board Term 1,2012, ELI-047)
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <strong>
            <br/>
           </strong>
           The child was attracted to the nature’s little aspects because of his innocence. When his mother diverted his attention towards the mustard field he saw the flowers which were in the nascent stage and flowering. The flpwers of the field were pale like melting gold. He then saw a group of dragon flies which were bustling about on their gandy purple wings, intercepting the flight of a lone black bee or butterfly in search of sweetness from the flowers. The child wanted to catch those dragon this but they went away fluttering and flapping. He also got attracted to the little insects and worms along the footh that were teeming out from their hiding places to enjoy the Sunshine. A §hower of young flowers fell upon the child as he entered the fair. He forgot about his parents and began to gather the raining petals in his hands. Again when he heard the cooing of doves, he ran towards his parents shouting about them.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 5:
           <strong>
            <br/>
           </strong>
           What all things did the child get attracted to, once be entered the fair ? Was he able to get all the things he desired ? What happened when he made a bold request to his parents ?
           <strong>
            (Board Term 1,2012, ELI-053)
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <strong>
            <br/>
           </strong>
           With a wide mouth, he stared at the sight of burfi. Later he was attracted to a garland of gulmohur and was carried away by the rainbow glory of the coloured balloons. He wanted them all but, on the other hand, he also knew the answers of his parents, so he convinced himself and did not ask them for anything. Finally, he made a bold request for going on the roundabout. As he turned to get their reply, he could not find them behind him.
