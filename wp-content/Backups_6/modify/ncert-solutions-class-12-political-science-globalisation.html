           </span>
           The worldwide interconnectedness implies to interlink the world through free flow of goods and services, technology, ideas and people across the globe to extend globalisation. This contains three components:
           <br/>
           1. Capital Flow: It is the flow of resources through loans or business investments among the countries.
           <br/>
           2. Trade Flows of Goods: It refers to exchange of goods among countries.
           <br/>
           3. Labour Flow: It refers to ‘Brain drain’ by creating favourable conditions for employment.

           Technical equipments as cell phone, internet, telephone and microchip have contributed to globalisation by exchanging ideas, capitals and people to make convenient to move from one place to another at a fast pace to stimulate the process of globalisation.

             Answer:
            </strong>
           </span>
           The impact of changing role of state in the developing countries in the light of globalisation can be summed up as follows:
           <br/>
           1. Globalisation reduces the state capacity i.e. the ability of governments to do what they do.
           <br/>
           2. Market becomes the prime concern to set down economic and social priorities.
           <br/>

           Cultural consequences do not assume to lead to cultural heterogeneity only. All cultures accept outside influences all the time. Some external influences may be negative even to reduce our choices. Sometime external influences enlarge the choices or modify our culture without overwhelming the traditions
           <br/>
           i. e. the burger is not a substitute for a masala dosa, blue jeans can go well with a homespun Khadi-Kurta (a nique new combination by external influences). Hence, it can be said that globalisation does not lead cultural heterogeneity every time but it is supportive to promote cultural outlook and cultural homogenisation.

           Globalisation results in an erosion of state capacity. All over the world, the old welfare state is now giving way to a more minimalist state that performs certain core functions such as maintenance of law and order and the security of its citizens. However, it withdraws from many of its earlier welfare functions directed at economic and social well¬being. In place of the welfare state, it is the market that becomes prime determinant of economic and social priorities. The entry and the increased role of MNCs all over the world leads to reduction in the capacity of government to take decisions on their own.

           1. The rise of uniform culture as cultural homogenisation.

           Globalisation leads to both:
           <br/>
           1. Though cultural homogenisation is an arena of globalisation the same process generates the opposite effect also which prompts each culture to dominate over other culture resulting into heterogenisation.
           <br/>
           2. Globalisation leads to the rise of uniform culture known as cultural homogenisation i.e. the influence of western culture.
           <br/>
           3. The differences among powers remain the same despite the exchange of cultures. Hence it may be said that cultural exchange is only one of many processes.

           <strong>
            At the most simple level, globalisation results in an erosion of state capacity, that is, the ability of government to do what they do. All over the world, the old ‘welfare state’ is now giving way to a more minimalist state that performs certain core functions such as the maintenance of law and order and the security of its citizens. However, it withdraws from many of its earlier welfare functions directed at economic and social well-being. In place of the welfare state, it is the market that becomes the prime determinant of economic and social priorities. The entry and the increased role of multinational companies all over the world leads to a reduction in the capacity of governments to take decisions on their own. At the same time, globalisation does not always reduce state capacity. The primacy of the state continues to be the unchallenged basis of political community. The old jealousies and rivalries between countries have not ceased to matter in world politics. The state continues to discharge its essential functions (law and order, national security) and consciously withdraws from certain domains from which it wishes to. States continue to be important. Indeed, in some respects state capacity has received a boost as a consequence of globalisation, with enhanced technologies available at the disposal of the state to collect information about its citizens. With this information, the state is better able to rule, not less able. Thus, states become more powerful than they were earlier as an outcome of the new technology.

            Advocates of economic globalisation argue that it generates greater economic growth and well-being for larger sections of the population when there is de-regulation. Greater trade among countries allows each economy to do what it does best. This would benefit the whole world. They also argue that economic globalisation is inevitable and it is not wise to resist the march of history. More moderate supporters of globalisation say that globalisation provides a challenge that can be responded to intelligently without accepting it uncritically. What, however, cannot be denied is the increased momentum towards inter-dependence and integration between governments, businesses, and ordinary people in different parts of the world as a result of globalisation.

             Answer:
            </strong>
           </span>
           Globalisation as a concept fundamentally deals with flows. These flows could be of various kinds — ideas moving from one part of the world to another, capital shunted between two or more places, commodities being traded across borders, and people moving in search of better livelihoods to different parts of the world. The crucial element is the ‘worldwide interconnectedness’ that is created and sustained as a consequence of these constant flows.
           <br/>
           While globalisation is not caused by any single factor, technology remains a critical element. There is no doubt that the invention of the telegraph, the telephone and the microchip in more recent years has revolutionised communication between different parts of the world. When printing initially came into being it laid the basis for the creation of nationalism. So also today we should expect that technology will affect the way we think of our personal but also our collective lives.
           <br/>
           The ability of ideas, capital, commodities and people to move more easily from one part of the world to another has been made possible largely by technological advances. The pace of these flow may vary.
