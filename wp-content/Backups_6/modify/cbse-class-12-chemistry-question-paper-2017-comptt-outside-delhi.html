           Derive integrated rate equation for rate constant of a first order reaction.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In a first order reaction, the rate of reaction, is directly proportional to the concentration of the reactant.
           <br/>
           Let us consider the reaction,
           <br/>
           A → Products
           <br/>
           The instantaneous reaction rate can be expressed as :
           <br/>
           \(\frac{-d[\mathrm{~A}]}{d t}\) = K[A] [K = rate constant)
           <br/>
           \(\frac{-d[\mathrm{~A}]}{[\mathrm{A}]}\) = Kdt ….. (i)
           <br/>
           On integrating equation (i)
           <br/>
           \(-\int \frac{d[\mathrm{~A}]}{[\mathrm{A}]}\) = K∫dt
           <br/>
           or —ln[A] = Kt + I ……. (ii)
           <br/>
           where, I = Integration constant
           <br/>
           If t = 0 and [A] = [A]
           <sub>
            0
           </sub>
           , where [A]
           <sub>
            0
           </sub>
           is the initial concentration of the reactant.
           <br/>
           Then equation (ii) becomes
           <br/>
           —ln[A]
           <sub>
            0
           </sub>
           = I …….. (iii)
           <br/>
           Substitute the value of I in equation (ii)
           <br/>
           -ln[A] = Kt – ln[A]
           <br/>
           ln[A]
           <sub>
            0
           </sub>
           – ln[A] = Kt
           <br/>
           ln\(\frac{[\mathrm{A}]_0}{[\mathrm{~A}]}\) = Kt
           <br/>
           Or K = \(\frac{1}{t} \ln \frac{[\mathrm{A}]_0}{[\mathrm{~A}]}\)
           <br/>
           K = \(\frac{2.303}{t} \log \frac{[\mathrm{A}]_0}{[\mathrm{~A}]}\)
           <br/>
           This is called integrated rate equation for the first order reaction.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           Given : Cell edge, a = 288 pm = 288 × 10
           <sup>

           Density, d = 7.2 g/cm

           <br/>
           For bcc formula units per cell Z = 2, M = ?
           <br/>
           Using formula and substituting values,

           M = \(\frac{d \times \mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{A}} \times a^3}{\mathrm{Z}}\)
           <br/>
           = \(\frac{7.2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^3 \times\left(6.022 \times 10^{23}\right) \times\left(288 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{~cm}\right)^3}{2}\)

           (iii) Physical adsorption decreases with increase in temperature.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Tyndall effect: When a beam of light is passed through a colloidal solution and viewed perpendicular to the path of the incident light, the path of light becomes visible as a bright streak. The illuminated path is called Tyndall cone and the phenomenon is called Tyndall effect. The phenomenon is due to scattering of light by the colloidal particles.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Brownian movement is the continuous and random zig-zag motion of the colloidal particles. This motion is due to kinetic motion of striking colloidal particles which produces a resultant force to cause motion.

          <p>
           (iii) Physical adsorption decreases with increase in temperature due to Le-Chatelier’s principle which shifts the equilibrium in forward direction to complete the reaction. As the adsorption is an exothermic process, it decreass with increase in temperature.

           (ii) Electrolytic refining: Here the impure metal is made to act as anode and a strip of the same metal in pure form is used as cathode. When they both are put in suitable electrolyte containing soluble salt of same metal, the more basic metal remains in the solution and the less basic ones go to the anode mud.

           (b) Calculate the magnetic moment of a divalent ion in aqueous medium if its atomic number is 26.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) (i) The catalytic properties of the transition elements are due to the presence of unpaired electrons in their incomplete d-orbitals and variable oxidation states. The colour of transition metal ions is due to d-d transition. When electrons jump from one orbital to another in their partially filled d-orbitals, another light is emitted due to which the compounds of transition elements seem to be coloured.
           <br/>
           (ii) MnO is basic while Mn

           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Water soluble vitamins must be supplied regularly in the diet because they are regularly excreted in urine and cannot be stored in our body. For eg., Vitamin C, Vitamin B, etc.

           (b) (i) Essential amino acids: Amino acids which the body cannot synthesize are called essential amino acids.
           <br/>
           Examples : Valine, leucine etc. Therefore they must be supplied in diet.
           <br/>
           Non-essential diet: Amino acids which the body can synthesize are called non-essential amino acids. Therefore, they may or may not be present in diet.

           Question 23.
           <br/>
           Once there was a heavy downpour for about 3 hours in the early morning. Irfan and his family were finding it difficult to cariy out their daily morning chores as the sewer water was flowing back into the toilets, the road in front of their house was flooded with water and they could not move out. On this very serious problem, Irfan called a meeting of all the residents. In the meeting Irfan discussed the problem and said that we are using too much polythene bags and other plastic items which we throw here and there. All these move into the drains and sewer lines which get choked and do not allow flow of water. As these are non-biodegradable, they remain as such for a long time. So to overcome this problem, we should use bags made up of cloth or jute which are biodegradable.

           Question 26.
           <br/>
           (a) Account for the following:
           <br/>
           (i) Propanal is more reactive than propanone towards nucleophilic reagents.
           <br/>
           (ii) Electrophilic substitution in benzoic acid takes place at meta position.
           <br/>
           (iii) Carboxylic acids do not give characteristic reactions of carbonyl group.
           <br/>
           (b) Give simple chemical test to distinguish between the following pairs of compounds:
           <br/>
           (i) Acetophenone and benzaldehyde
           <br/>
           (ii) Benzoic acid and ethylbenzoate. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) (i) Due to steric and + I effect of two methyl groups in propanone.
           <br/>
           (Ii) The benzene ring of henzoic acid undergoes electrophilic substitution reaction such as nitration, suiphonation etc. Since the —COOH group in henzene is an electron withdrawing group, therefore it is mcta directing group.
           <br/>
           (iii) The carboxylic carbon is less electrophilic than carbonyl carbon because of the possible resonance structure.

           <br/>
           Explain the following observations:
           <br/>
           (a) Silver atom has completely filled d-orbitais (4d
           <sup>
            10
           </sup>
           ) in its ground state, yet it is
           <br/>
           regarded as a transition element.
           <br/>
           (b) E° value for Mn
           <sup>
            3+
           </sup>
           /Mn
           <sup>
            2+
           </sup>
           couple is much more positive than Cr
           <sup>
            3+
           </sup>
           /Cr
           <sup>
            2+
           </sup>
           . [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Because silver has incomplete d-orbital (4d
           <sup>
            9
           </sup>
           ) in its +2 oxidatìon state, hence it is a transition element.
           <br/>
           (b) The large positive E° value for Mn
           <sup>
            3+
           </sup>
           /Mn
           <sup>
            2+
           </sup>
           shows that Mn
           <sup>
            2+
           </sup>
           is much more stable than Mn
           <sup>
            +3
           </sup>
           due to stable half filled configuration (3d
           <sup>
            5
           </sup>
           ). Therefore the 3
           <sup>
            rd
           </sup>
           ionisation energy of Mn will be very high and Mn
           <sup>
            3+
           </sup>
           is unstable and can be easily reduced to Mn
           <sup>
            2+
           </sup>
           . E° value for Cr
           <sup>
            3+
           </sup>
           | Cr is positive but šmall i.e. Cr
           <sup>
            3+
           </sup>
           can also be reduced to Cr
           <sup>
            2+
           </sup>
           but less easily. Thus Cr
           <sup>
            3+
           </sup>
           is more stable than Mn
           <sup>
            3+
           </sup>
           .

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Following reactions may occur at cathode during the electrolysis of aqueous silver nitrate solution using silver electrodes:
           <br/>
           \(\mathbf{A g}_{(\mathrm{aq})}^{+}\) + e
           <sup>
            -1
           </sup>
           → Ag
           <sub>
            (s)
           </sub>
           ; E
           <sup>
            0
           </sup>
           = 0.80V
           <br/>
           \(\mathbf{H}_{(\mathrm{aq})}^{+}\) + e
           <sup>
            -1
           </sup>
           → \(\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{H}_{2(\mathrm{~g})}\) ; E
           <sup>
            0
           </sup>
           = 0.00V
           <br/>
           On the basis of their standard electrode potential values, which reaction is feasible at cathode and why? [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The value of E
           <sup>
            0
           </sup>
           <sub>
            cell
           </sub>
           is positive due to higher standard electrode potential (E° = +0.80 V) of
           <br/>
           Ag+ than that of H+ so reaction (i) will be feasible at cathode
           <br/>
           i.e. \(\mathrm{Ag}_{(\mathrm{aq})}^{+}\) + e
           <sup>
            –

           Question 17.
           <br/>
           Write the principles involved in the following methods of refining of metals:
           <br/>
           (i) Zone refining
           <br/>
           (ii) Chromatographic method
           <br/>
           (iii) Electrolytic refining [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Zone refining of metals : It is based on the principle that the impurities are more soluble in melt than in the solid state of the metal.
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Class 12 Chemistry Question Paper 2017 Comptt (Outside Delhi) with Solutions 35" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-168374" height="137" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CBSE-Class-12-Chemistry-Question-Paper-2017-Comptt-Outside-Delhi-with-Solutions-35.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CBSE-Class-12-Chemistry-Question-Paper-2017-Comptt-Outside-Delhi-with-Solutions-35.png 508w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CBSE-Class-12-Chemistry-Question-Paper-2017-Comptt-Outside-Delhi-with-Solutions-35-300x81.png 300w" width="508"/>
           <br/>
           (ii) Chromatography. This is the method used for the separation and purification of elements. It can also be used for testing the purity of a compound. The principle behind the chromatography is that different components of a mixture are differently adsorbed on an adsorbent.
           <br/>
           (iii) Electrolytic refining: Here the impure metal is made to act as anode and a strip of the same metal in pure form is used as cathode. When they both are put in suitable electrolyte containing soluble salt of same metal, the more basic metal remains in the solution and the less basic ones go to the anode mud.

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           (i) What is the order of the reaction whose rate constant has same units as the rate of reaction?
           <br/>
           (ii) For a reaction A + H
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           O → B; Rate ∝ [A]. What is the order of this reaction? [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) The reaction whose rate constant has same units as the rate of reaction, will have zero order of reaction.
           <br/>
           (ii) The reaction A + H
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           O → B Rate ∝ [A]
           <br/>
           The order of this reaction will be pseudo first order reaction as the rate of reaction depends only on concentration of A only.
