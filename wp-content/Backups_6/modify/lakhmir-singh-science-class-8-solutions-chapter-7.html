           Question 19.
           <br/>
           What is meant by deforestation? what are the causes of deforestation?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Deforestation is the removal of a forest or strands of trees where the land is thereafter converted to a non-forest use. Examples of deforestation include conversion of forestland to farms, ranches, or urban use.

           What is desertification? Name one human activity which may lead to desertification.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Desertification is a land degradation in which relatively dry area of land becomes increasingly arid, typically losing its bodies of water and vegetation and wildlife.
          </p>
          <p>
           Agriculture, animal husbandry, and groundwater pumping/depletion, are all significant contributors to the process.

           Question 22.
           <br/>
           Explain how, deforestation makes the soil infertile leading to desertification.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Deforestation in simple term means the felling and clearing of forest cover or tree plantations to accommodate agricultural, industrial or urban use. It involves permanent end of forest cover to make that land available for residential, commercial or industrial purpose. Deforestation can also be seen as removal of forests leading to several imbalances ecologically and environmentally. What makes deforestation alarming is the immediate and long term effects it is bound to inflict if continued at the current pace. Some predictions state that the rain forests of the world will be destroyed completely if deforestation continues at its current pace.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Global Warming is the increase of Earth’s average surface temperature due to effect of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels or from deforestation, which trap heat that would otherwise escape from Earth. the gas responsible for causing global warming is carbon dioxide.

           Question 24.
           <br/>
           How does deforestation reduce rainfall on the one hand and lead to floods on the other?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When trees are cut down and there is desertification in that area so there is no transpiration and hence it result in no or minimal rainfall. When there are floods the absence of trees leads to soil erosion. It is due to the fact due to absence of trees there are no roots to hold the soil together and it gets washed away in flood.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A biosphere reserve is an ecosystem with plants and animals of unusual scientific and natural interest.
           <br/>
           Each Biosphere Reserve should fulfill three basic functions, which are complementary and mutually reinforcing:
           <br/>
           Conservation function–to contribute to the conservation of landscapes, ecosystems, species and genetic variation;
           <br/>
           Development function–to foster economic and human development which is socio-culturally and ecologically sustainable;
           <br/>
           Logistic function–to provide support for research, monitoring, education and information exchange related to local, national and global issues of conservation and development.

           By taking the example of snakes, explain how by killing small animals, we are actually harming ourselves.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The killing of small animals disturb the life cycle and food chain. For example if we kill snakes, rodents that are eaten by snakes will increase in number and destroy the crop at mass level. In another case if we kill frogs then the number of insects that destroy our crops and are eaten by frogs will damage the crop. In nutshell killing of any animal leads to our own harm.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Bird migration is the regular seasonal movement, often north and south along a flyway, between breeding and wintering grounds. Many species of bird migrate. Migration carries high costs in predation and mortality, including from hunting by humans, and is driven primarily by availability of food. BIrds also migrate for favourable weather for their survival and breeding.

           Question 53.
           <br/>
           What are migratory birds? Name one migratory bird which comes to warmer regions of India every year.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Migratory birds are those birds that fly hundreds and thousands of kilometres to find the best ecological conditions and habitats for feeding, breeding and raising their young. When conditions at breeding sites become unfavourable, it is time to fly to regions where conditions are better.

           Why does Siberian crane come from Siberia to places like Bharatpur in In India every year.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Siberian cranes comes to India during winter because in Siberia, it is cold, daylight is of shorter duration, food is scarce. So they look for better living conditions else where to rear their young ones and to come to India as it has favourable conditions for their survival.

           Question 61 A.
           <br/>
           What is meant by the term ‘Wildlife’? Why should forests and wildlife be conserved?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Wildlife traditionally refers to undomesticated animal species, but includes all plants, fungi, and other organisms that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans.
          </p>
          <p>
           We should protect forest and wildlife because Forests provide us oxygen, they cause rainfall, prevents soil erosion, Plants depend on animals and birds for their pollination and seed dispersal. Forests provide us various medicines. Various forest products are used as raw materials in industries.
          </p>
          <p>
           The wild life including animal, plant and marine biodiversity keeps ecosystems functional and balanced. Healthy ecosystems allow us to survive, get enough food to eat and make a living. Biodiversity is critical to ending poverty and promoting shared prosperity for the millions who depend on nature for their livelihoods.

           <br/>
           What are the various purposes for which the forest trees are cut?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Trees are cut down for many reasons.
           <br/>
           Trees are cut to make space to build new houses and to clear land to grow crops for human consumption, grass for animals like domestic and milch animals so they can produce dairy foods. The trees are also cut down for production of paper and making of furniture. Sometimes trees are cut to make roads and buildings.

           Question 62 B.
           <br/>
           What is effect of deforestation on wild animals?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The effect of deforestation on wild animals is severe. The animals lose their natural habitat. They have to look for alternate habitat. Further due to loss of trees, the availability of food is scarce. The food chain is disturbed. In the absence of trees, if there is heavy rainfall, animals drown in flood. Due to deforestation the rains become scanty and animals die due thirst as natural water bodies dries up.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 63 A.
           <br/>
           How does deforestation cause soil erosion?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Deforestation means cutting of trees. When trees are cut, the soil becomes loose. When there is heavy rainfall or flood, the soil being loose is washed away and this leads to soil erosion. This leads to flood and landsliding.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 63 B.
           <br/>
           Explain how, deforestation leads to frequent flooding of rivers.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Deforestation plays several roles in the flooding equation Tree roots hold the soil in place, reducing the movement of sediment that can shrink river channels downstream. However in the absence of trees, soil is loosened, and it gets washed away easily with water or torrential rains and is deposited into river. When rivers have soil and water level more than their holding capacity, it lead to over flooding and causes floods.

          <p>
           Question 64 A.
           <br/>
           Explain how, deforestation leads to reduced rainfall.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Plants need carbon dioxide for the process of photosynthesis. Fewer trees would mean that less carbon dioxide will be used up resulting in its increased amount in the atmosphere and increase in greenhouse effect. The increase in temperature on the earth disturbs the water cycle and may reduce rainfall. When number of trees are reduced then less amount of water is evaporated and hence the reduced evaporation leads to reduced rainfall.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 64 B.
           <br/>
           How does deforestation lead to global warming?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Deforestation leads to global warming. When trees are there, during the process of photosynthesis, the carbon dioxide (CO
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           ) is used and oxygen is give out. When there are more and more no trees they use more carbon dioxide and give out oxygen and bring more rainfall. However when the number of trees are few, the amount of carbon dioxide is increased. Carbon dioxide causes greenhouse effect and global warming. The reduce rainfall also increases the temperature and causes global warming.
