            Aggressive nationalism
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The ideology of nationalism was a positive impulse. It was the foundation of modern nation states and the force behind the unification of Germany and Italy. But this ideology could also be used to create pride in one self and hatred against neighbours. This hatred was slowly building up in the 19th century between the states of Europe.

           <br/>
           Indira Gandhi took up the challenge both from within her party as well those outside by taking a sharp left turn post the 1967 elections. She attempted to create a new social base of her own and for her party by identifying with the poor and downtrodden. This move was a double edged weapon. Old promises of social and economic development were yet to be fulfilled and this was seen to be the major reason for the Congress defeat in 1967. Yet, Indira was making new promises. Less than a decade later, the lack of fulfilment of rising mass expectations created frustration and disheartenment and culminated with the imposition of Emergency.
           <br/>
           1) What did Indira Gandhi attempt ?
           <br/>
           2) What happened less than a decade later ?

           <strong>
            A.
           </strong>
           The issue depends on the aggressive stance taken by that government.
           <br/>
           Whatever may be the situation the other country need not respond aggressively. There are many other ways of handling the problems :
           <br/>
           1) They can appeal to the UNO.
           <br/>
           2) They can try to pacify the situation through talks, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            2. A.
           </strong>
           1) The countries like Germany and Italy were unified in 1870.
           <br/>
           2) Nationalism was an impulse behind unification.
           <br/>
           3) Nationalism developed pride in them.
           <br/>
           4) At the same time “it” developed hatred towards other nation.
           <br/>
           5) This hatred led to aggressive farms like Nazism in Germany and Fascism in Italy.
           <br/>
           6) They challenged the other countries.
           <br/>
           7) Finally this aggressive nationalism led to World War-II.

           2) Unipolarity in international politics describes a distribution of power in which there is one state with most of the cultural, economic and military influence. This is also called a hegemony or hyper power.

           </strong>
           <br/>
           Nigeria became independent on 1st October,1963. Unfortunately a just and democratic balance could not be worked out and soon Nigeria slipped into civil war and military rule which largely reinforced the domination of the north. Attempts were made repeatedly to bring in civilian and democratic governments but these failed again and again. Corruption and suppression of human rights went hand in hand with collaboration between the military regime and multinational Oil corporations which funded the corrupt rulers. After a long haul of military dictatorship, Nigerians elected a democratic government in 1999. It remains to be seen how it faces the challenges of building a democratic Nigeria,

           <strong>
            A.
           </strong>
           The French colonisers like the British were convinced that the people of the colony were uncivilised and the objective of their rule was to bring the benefits of modern civilisation. Education was seen as one way to civilise the ‘natives’. The French needed an educated local labour force but they feared that education might create problems. Once educated, the Vietnamese may begin to question colonial domination. Moreover, French citizens living in Vietnam (called colons) began fearing that they might lose their jobs – as teachers, shopkeepers, policemen – to the educated Vietnamese. So they opposed policies that would give the Vietnamese full access to French education. Even though Vietnamese language was taught in the primary level, all higher education was in French. Only the Vietnamese elite – comprising a small fraction of the population – could enroll in the schools,and only a few among those admitted ultimately passed the school-leaving examination. School textbooks glorified the French and justified colonial rule.

           <strong>
            A.
           </strong>
           The very first challenge which came immediately after independence was the integration of ‘Princely states’ into the Indian Union. The integration process was as usual not smooth and had various difficulties such as : ‘
           <br/>
           1. At the time of independence it was announced by the British that with the end of their rule over India, paramountcy of the British crown over princely states would also lapse.
           <br/>
           2. As a result, British government took the view that all these states were free to join either India or Pakistan or remain independent if they so wished. This was a very serious problem and could threaten the very existence of a United India.
           <br/>
           3. Another problem arose very soon. First of all, the ruler of Travancore annouced that the state had decided on independence. The Nizam of Hyderabad and the Nawab of Bhopal also made the similar announcements.
           <br/>
           4. This response of the rulers of the princely states meant that after independence there was a very real possibility that India would be further divided into a number of small countries. This was a strange situation since Indian independence was aimed at unity, self determination as well as democracy.

            e.g. : Self-Government and Equality :
           </strong>
           A reference to the history of British rule and Indian Independence struggle provides basic idea of self-governance that emerged into a people’s participative democracy.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Federalism :
           </strong>
           Genesis of idea of federalism in India was first traced in ‘Simon Commission’ 1927. The representatives of princely states declared the First Round table Conference (1930-32) that they would join an ‘All India federation with a self- governing British India’. This preferred creation of All India Federation. Fundamental Rights : The inclusion in Constitution of a distinct part guaranteeing Fundamental Rights can be traced to the forces that operated in the struggle for independence during British rule.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Sovereignty :
           </strong>
           The British colonial rule made the Constitution framers to add the ‘Sovereignty in our Constitution’.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Socialism :
           </strong>
           Despite all social, economic and political inequality present and inherent in Indian traditional society, there were many political struggles. So our Constitution started a crusade against that.

           <strong>
            A.
           </strong>
           1) A coalition government leads to more concensus-based politics, in that a government comprising differing parties would need to concur in regard to governmental policy.
           <br/>
           2) These kind of governments have a tendency to be fractions and prone to disharmony.
           <br/>
           3) Another difficulty might be the ability of minor parties to play “King maker” and, particularly in close election, gain far more their support than their vote would otherwise indicate.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            e.g.
           </strong>
           : The Congress politics in the formation of Telangana. .
           <br/>
           4) The political ideologies and programmes of a number of parties had to be accommodated and a common agreement had to be arrived at. Thus the party could pursue its extreme agendas and had to tone down their approaches.
