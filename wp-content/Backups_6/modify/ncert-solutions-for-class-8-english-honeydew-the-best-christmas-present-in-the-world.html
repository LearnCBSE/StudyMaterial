           <li>
            John Macpherson, a captain in the British army, had written that letter, dated Dec. 26, 1914, to his wife Connie.
           </li>
           <li>
            The letter described a wonderful event. The two armies-the British and the Ger­man—fighting against each other celebrated Christmas together.
           </li>
           <li>
            Before joining the army, Hans played the cello in the orchestra and Jim was a teacher.
           </li>
           <li>
            No, Hans had never been to Dorset. He had only read about Dorset in Hardy’s novel ‘Far from the Madding Crowd’.
           </li>
           <li>
            No, Jim Macpherson never came back home from the war. Perhaps therefore his wife Connie had preserved his letters.

           </span>
           <br/>
           Both Jim and Hans were soldiers. Both were warm hearted. They had seen the sufferings of war. So it was natural for them to hate war. They favoured a peaceful solution to settle disputes. Games or sports, they said, were good ways of resolving conflicts. I also quite agree with them.

           </span>
           <br/>
           The British and the German soldiers belonged to different camps. They were enemies in war time. But after all they were human beings and therefore they had similar feelings. They shared the festive spirit of the Christmas. They got over hatred and played games, feasted and drank like good friends. Both hated war. Both were anxious to go back to their families at the end of war.

           Connie thought that Jim had come back home from war. She mistook the author for Jim. She had been waiting for her husband Jim. So the coming home of Jim was the best Christmas present in the world for her.

           Decidedly the title of the story is most suitable. For the old Connie, no other present could have given her such joy as the coming home of Jim, her husband. Her presumption might be wrong, but she got the greatest happiness of her life. Since the story revolves around Christmas, the alternate title of the story could be War and Peace’ or ‘Christmas Gift’. But neither can be a match to the present title.

           Look at these sentences from the story.

           <strong>
            (i) Read the passage below and underline the verb in the past tense.

           <br/>
           A man got on the train and sat down. The compartment was empty except for one lady. She took her gloves off. A few hours later the police arrested the man. They held him for 24 hours and then freed him.

            Now look at these sentences.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The veneer had lifted almost everywhere. Both fire and water had taken their toll on this desk.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Notice the verb forms had lifted, had taken (their toll).
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The author found and bought the desk in the past. The desk was damaged before the author found it and bought it. Fire and water had damaged the desk before the author found it and bought it.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            We use verb forms like had damaged for an event in the ‘earlier past’. If there are two events in the past, we used the ‘had ….’ form for the event that occurred first in the past.
           </li>
           <li>
            We also use the past perfect tense to show that something was wished for, or expected before a particular time in the past. For example, I had always wanted one

            Notice the order in which the adjectives occur—size (small), colour (black) and material (tin) of which it is made.

           War means bloodshed, hate and destruction. It shows the animalism in man. Even the animals fight for some sound reason. But nations go to war to settle some petty dispute or in the name of religion. War solves no problem. Understanding alone can end differences. All religions condemn greed and bloody quarrels. Let us learn this great lesson from history.

           Personally I am against the practice of exchanging expensive gifts. A rose or a token of affection suits every person and every pocket. This is why some guests offer bouquets or greeting cards alone. In case the gift is essential, it should satisfy some need and
           <sup>
            1
           </sup>
           have utility. When I go to buy a present, I first take into account the liking of my classmate, relative or girl/boy friend.

           It’s Christmas today, but the town looks very much different from what I had imagined. It has been ravaged by war. Buildings are in ruins and there is graveyard silence. My own house burnt when it was hit by a bombardment. The events of war have taken a toll of civilians as well as soldiers. I hate the fighting instinct in us and curse the war makers (monger). Can’t we live in peace like brothers?

           <br/>
           I am in a dilemma. It seems to be insolvable. I, therefore, seek your help in making a decision.
           <br/>
           You know I had purchased an old desk. Inside it I got a box containing an old letter. It was written by Jim, a British soldier, to his wife. I decided to deliver that letter to Mrs. Jim at Briport.
           <br/>
           I reached her house. She was 101 years old. When I gave her the letter, her eyes lit up. She thought I was her long lost husband Jim, who had come home to keep his promise. She was excited and she kissed me. She didn’t listen to what I tried to tell her about my identity.
           <br/>
           I don’t know whether or not I should tell who I am. I only walked away from her quickly.

           ) It was a group of Islands in the Bay of Bengal. Many freedom fighters and revolutionaries were sent there for life. They were put in cellular Jail for a few years. They were subjected to torture. The doctor was hanged. But his wife kept waiting for the return of her husband. She grew old. However, her hope and faith did not fade.

           England and Germany were at war with each other. The British soldiers were waiting to shoot the German soldiers. But on Christmas, a strange development took place. The German soldiers came out of their hiding places and called out ‘Happy Christmas’. They were unarmed and they waved a white flag. The British soldiers led by captain Jim Macpherson agreed to celebrate the festival together.

           Connie or Mrs Macpherson was 101 years old. When the author took Jim’s letter to her in a nursing home she became very excited. Her eyes lit up and she mistook the author for her husband. She kissed his cheek. She said that she had been reading his letter every day. But she wanted to hear his voice. She had made a Christmas cake also for him as he had promised to come home. She thought that he was back home. She called his presence at home as the best Christmas present for her in the world.
