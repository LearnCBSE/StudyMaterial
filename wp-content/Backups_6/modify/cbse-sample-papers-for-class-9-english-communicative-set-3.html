          </p>
          <p>
           Read the following passage.
          </p>
          <p>
           (A) Papaya is a soft tropical fruit with a yellowish-orange colour. This species of fruit — which belongs to the Caricaceae family — is round and plump and comes in different sizes.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           (B) It’s believed that papaya is native to tropical America, with early origins in Mexico and South America. The fruit was brought into the Caribbean by indigenous people, and eventually made its way to Europe and the Pacific Islands before being introduced to Hawaii in the 1800s. Today, Hawaii is the only U.S. state to commercially produce papaya. Most papayas are from either Hawaii or Mexico. Mexican papayas can weigh up to 10 pounds (lb) and grow more than 15 inches long. Hawaiian papayas are smaller, averaging about 1 lb.
          </p>
          <p>
           (C) Papaya is the healthiest fruit with a list of properties that is long and exhaustive. Papaya favours digestion, as well as, cures skin irritation and sunburns. You can munch on it as a salad, have it cooked or boiled or just drink it up as milkshake or juice. Its taste depends on whether you’re eating ripe or unripe papaya. When ripe, papaya is sweet and has a flavour comparable to a melon. Unripe papaya, on the other hand, may have little to no flavour. The most important of these virtues is the protein – digesting enzyme in the milky juice or latex. The enzyme is similar to pepsin in its digestive action and is said to be so powerful that it can digest 200 times its own weight in protein. It assists the body in assimilating the maximum nutritional value from food to provide energy and body-building materials.
          </p>
          <p>
           (D) Because papaya comes from Hawaii or Mexico, chances are good you’ll be able to find this fruit in a grocery store all-year-round.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           (E) But just because papaya is available 12 months round the year doesn’t mean that every selection is a perfect one. For the best tasting papaya, only purchase the fruit when ripe, or hold off eating the fruit until it ripens.
          </p>
          <p>
           (F) Unripe papaya has a colour that’s a mixture of yellow and green. Ripe papaya, on the other hand, is bright yellow and firm (but it can feel soft with gentle pressure). If you’re buying a ripe papaya, avoid fruit that’s overly soft unless you plan to use it in a smoothie or as a puree.
          </p>
          <p>
           (G) Good papaya also has little or no blemishes. An unripe papaya from the grocery store should ripen in a couple of days. After it’s ripe, store the fruit in the refrigerator to help slow down the ripening process.
          </p>
          <p>
           (H) If you have leftover papaya, it can be stored in the freezer for up to 10 months. Remove the seeds first and then cut the fruit into small pieces for storage.
          </p>
          <p>
           (I) Papain in raw papaya makes up for the deficiency of gastric juice and fights excess of unhealthy mucus in the stomach, dyspepsia and intestinal irritation. The ripe fruit, if eaten regularly, corrects habitant constipation, bleeding piles and chronic diarrhoea.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           (J) A table spoon of its juice, combined with a hint of fresh lime juice, should be taken once or twice daily for a month. The fresh juice of raw papaya mixed with honey can be applied over inflamed tonsils, for diphtheria and other throat disorders. It dissolves the membrane and prevents infection from spreading. The nutrients in papaya have also been shown to be helpful in the prevention of colon cancer. Papaya’s fibre is able to control cancer-causing toxins in the colon and keeps them away from the healthy colon cells. In addition, papaya’s folate, vitamin C, beta-carotene and vitamin E have each been associated with a reduced risk of colon cancer. These nutrients provide synergistic protection for colon cells from free radical damage to their DNA. Increasing your intake of these nutrients by enjoying papaya is an especially good idea for individuals at the risk of colon cancer.

          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Read the following passage.
          </p>
          <p>
           (A) Nothing spells extravagance like silk does. Producing silk is a lengthy process and demands close attention. First, quality feed for silkworms needs to be cultivated. Then the worms need to be carefully hand-reared in controlled environmental conditions till the pupae spin the silk cocoons. The silk is extracted by human hand and then woven into fabric.
          </p>
          <p>
           (B) India’s southern region specialises in the production of rich silk yams that are used in combination with • other yams that are then transformed into awe-inspiring fabrics. India prides itself as the only country that produces all types of natural silk, made from various types of silk-spinning worms. Mulberry, tussar, eri and munga are special to India. The silk yam of south India is recognised as authentic and elegant not only in the country, but globally. Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are among the leading states producing silk yam in India. South India is the leading silk-producing area of the country, and is also known for its famous silk-weaving enclaves like Kanchipuram, Dharmavaram and Ami. The traditional handloom silk always scores over the powerloom ones in the richness of their textures and design, in their individuality, character and classic beauty. Handloom weaving remains a symbol of the versatility and creativity of living craft. Today, Indian silks, especially the handloom product remains the most beautiful and cherished product in the world over.
          </p>
          <p>
           (C) It is estimated that almost 85 per cent of the price of silk in the market goes back to communities that are engaged in sericulture and silk industry as the entire families are involved in production rather than one bread winner.
          </p>
          <p>
           (D) It plays a huge role in the upliftment of communities from poverty to prosperity. If the consumption of silk increases, the entire village tends to prosper. The final part of silk production is the weaving of the fabric which is considered more of an art than an act. These communities depend solely on weaving silk for their livelihood and the distinct regions have developed their own character of weaving silk to establish indelible identities for themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
           (E) Silk has been intermingled with the life and culture of the Indians. Though India is producing all the varieties of silk, i.e., dress materials, scarves/stoles, readymade garments, etc., the silk sarees are unique. The saree is almost synonymous with the word silk. It has been the traditional costume of Indian women since time immemorial. There are innumerable references in Indian literature about this draped garment and the style of wearing differs from time to time, region to region and people to people.
          </p>
          <p>
           The silk sarees of India are among the excellent living examples of the craftsmanship of the weavers of the country. Though India has earned a predominant position in the world with rising silk demand, it still lags behind China in silk production. India contributes around 15 per cent of the world’s total silk production while China contributes more than 80 per cent of global production. In India, the cost of imported silk yam is approximately ₹ 4,500 per kg while domestic yam is sold between ₹ 3,500 and ₹ 3,800 per kg.
          </p>

           Dear Grandma
          </p>
          <p>
           Hope this letter of mine will find you in good health and happiness.
          </p>
          <p>
           Today I am writing this letter to you because I am very happy and I want to share my feelings with you. Last week, we had an Inter-School Dance competition in our school auditorium. Nearly 20 schools of Ajmer participated in it. To tell you the truth, I was one of the members of the organising committee. I was the main choreographer of our school’s welcome dance and two other dances. After all the performances were done by all 20 different schools, when the results were declared, my choreographed ‘Welcome Dance’ came first. I was really excited. Next morning at the school assembly, my Principal congratulated and praised me and my other committee members for our wonderful performance. We all were awarded with certificates and medals and Principal sir assured us that we will be given some gifts.
          </p>
          <p>
           Grandma just imagine, how one feels when praised and recognised in front of the whole school in assembly. It was a time of pride and appreciation. My Principal’s words are just echoing in my ears calling out my name. Grandma, I want to dedicate and share this success with you, because you are my true inspiration. You are a good dancer yourself and you also encouraged me to learn dancing.
          </p>
          <p>
           Thank you grandma, I love you.
           <br/>

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A burglary took place in Mr. Ravikant’s house last night at 11:30 p.m. when he with his wife was out of the city and his housekeeper was left alone in the house. A police inspector who is in charge of the case came to Mr. Ravikant’s housekeeper for certain inquiries. The housekeeper told him that it was a terrible experience to see a burglar right away in the front with a dreadful knife. He was 6ft tall and well-built. He was not thin but rather plump. His clothes were old and faded. He was wearing a faded black shirt and dark shade-either blue or black trousers. He had straight black hair and an oval face with grey eyes. He had a dark complexion and he was wearing spectacles with a plastic frame and his nose was rather sharp. His lips were quite thick. The housekeeper also noticed the six fingers on his right hand. The Policeman assures him that they will make sketches on the basis of the above description to nab him.

           Write a paragraph in about 150 words on the topic ’How to Save the Environment at Home’.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Everyone may play a vital role in preserving our planet by protecting their local environment. There are various methods to accomplish this, and each one begins with a modest step. The use of less energy is one strategy to protect the environment. By turning off lights and disconnecting electronics while not in use, this can be accomplished. Another method is to use less water by making small changes like repairing leaky faucets and taking shorter showers. Separating trash and correctly discarding recyclable materials are two important ways to recycle at home and contribute to environmental preservation. Lastly, using sustainable practices and eco-friendly products can assist to lessen the damaging effects of our daily actions on the environment. These are only a few ways by which everyone of us may contribute to protect the environment at home.

           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Answer ANY SIX of the following seven questions in about 30 – 40 words each. 2 × 6 = 12
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) How did the poet carry the sweet music in his heart in ‘The Solitary Reaper’?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The melodious song fascinated him so much that he carried its sweet melody in his heart for a long time. He remembered the music even after he could not hear the song anymore and further expresses it through his poem.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) How can one look after one’s teeth, according to the poet?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           One can look after its teeth by avoiding Sweet . and sticky food as well as sweets. We should also brush after every meal and pay a visit to the dentist for a regular dental check up.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Compare the sixth stage with seventh stage with reference to poem “The Seven Ages”.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The sixth stage is that in which man becomes old, weak and thin. In his loose clothes he looks funny. In the seventh stage he becomes senile. He enters into ‘second childishness’. He is as dependent upon others as a child. He has no teeth, no sense of taste and loses every mental faculty.

           (iv) What message does Alexander Baron want to give to the readers in ‘The Man Who Knew Too Much’?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The message that Alexander Baron wants to give is that it is not advisable to prove your intellectual superiority all the time even before your superiors or elders. It may lead to lack in grace. It may harm your own interest. It doesn’t help to impress others. So, one should observe a proper code of conduct at one’s field of training or workplace.

           (v) Why did the senior curate advise the Brambles to hide Mr. Bramble’s profession from Harold?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Impressed with Harold’s brilliance and good conduct the senior curate wished the child to enjoy the best of bringing up. He had the apprehension that if this sensitive boy learnt about the not-so-respectable job of his father, he would develop a complex, which would adversely affect his future. Hence, he advised the Brambles against revealing the father’s real job to Harold.
          </p>
          <p>
           (vi) In what sense Pescud resembled ‘Trevelyan’, the hero of the bestseller, ‘The Rose Lady and Trevelyan’?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Trevelyan had chased a royal lady home, got introduced to her, wooed her and eventually got married despite the huge difference in their stations. Pescud’s romance had also run on the same lines.
          </p>
          <p>
           (vii) What impression did Jessie give John about her father Colonel Allyn?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Jessie told John that her father was a lineal descendant of ‘Belted Earls’. Very conscious and proud of his lineage, the Colonel would never allow a commoner to woo his daughter. She also warned that the old man would treat him sternly if he tried to make any further advances.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Answer ANY ONE of the following two questions in about 120 words. 6 × 1 = 6
          </p>
          <p>
           (A) Discuss the message conveyed in the story, ‘A Dog Named Duke’.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Life is a continuous journey; a strange mixture of sweetness, bitterness, joys and sorrows. Some are unable to stand upright in the times of adversity and crumble, but those who maintain courage and endurance, successfully overcome the grief. Chuck could have chosen to remain paralysed and to not respond to Duke’s helpful gestures. But he kept the flame of hope kindled and with his strong will power, overcome his handicap. The story conveys the message that coping up with the challenges of life and accepting them as they come can give one an inner strength to find solutions to the most complex problems of life.

           (B) Give a character sketch of grandmother from the story ’How I Taught My Grandmother to Read’.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The grandmother was an old lady of sixty- two. She was uneducated as she had never been to school. She regretted her illiteracy when her granddaughter went to attend a wedding ceremony. At that moment, she felt helpless and dependent as she could not read ‘Karmaveera’ on her own. She didn’t know how to read. This incident brought a change in her life. She decided that she would learn to read so that she could become independent.
          </p>
          <p>
           Her will-power and firm determination helped her and she succeeded in learning to read. She believed that ‘for learning, age is never an obstacle’ and she proved it right. She was a traditional lady who believed in touching the feet of God, elders and teachers; that’s why, on Dussehra festival, she touched the feet of her granddaughter as a mark of respect towards her teacher. To sum up, she was an affectionate lady with great will-power and firm-determination.
