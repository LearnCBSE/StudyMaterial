           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below.
           <br/>
           Call it a blessing or a curse of Mother Nature, we have to breathe in over 10,000 litres of air in a day (more than four million litres in a year) to remain alive. By making it essential for life, God wanted us to keep the air we breathe clean. Everyone can see the food that is not clean and perhaps refrain from eating it, but one cannot stop breathing even if one can feel the air to be polluted.
          </p>
          <p>
           5. Several harmful and noxious substances can contaminate the air we breathe. Generally, much is said and written about outdoor air pollution, most of which is due to vehicular and industrial exhausts. Given the fact that most of us spend most of our time indoors, it is most important to recognise that the air we breathe in at home or in offices can be polluted. It can be a cause of ill-health. Air pollutants that are generally present in very low concentrations
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           10. can assume significance in closed ill- ventilated places. .The indoor air pollution can lead to allergic reactions and cause irritation to the skin, the eyes and the nose. But as is logical to assume, the brunt of insult by pollutants is borne by the lungs. It can lead to the development of fresh breathing problems, especially in those who have allergic tendencies, or it can worsen the existing respiratory illnesses like asthma and bronchitis. There can be several sources of indoor air pollution. Tobacco smoke is one of the most
          </p>
          <p>
           15. important air pollutants in closed places. “Passive smoking” or environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) pollution can lead to all the harmful effects of tobacco smoking seen in the smokers in their non-smoking companions. ETS as a health hazard has been unequivocally proven and is also getting social recognition now. One can occasionally see signs displaying the all-important message: “Your smoking is injurious to my health” in offices and homes.
          </p>
          <p>
           20. The children of smoking parents are among the worst affected persons. The exposure of young children to ETS leads to increased respiratory problems and hospital admissions as compared to non-exposed children. Several studies, including those done at the PGI, have shown an increased risk of lung cancer among women exposed to passive smoking. ETS also worsens the existing lung diseases like asthma and bronchitis. It may be responsible for the development of asthma in children.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           25. The gases are very toxic in high concentrations as may be encountered during industrial accidents, but even in very minimal amounts, as may be prevalent in homes and offices, they can cause irritation to the skin or the eyes, rashes, headache, dizziness and nausea. Improving the ventilation is an important preventive measure, besides trying to eliminate the source that may not be always feasible. Other indoor pollutants are toxic chemicals like cleansing agents, 30.pesticides, paints, solvents and inferior quality personal-care products, especially aerosols. Very old crumbling pipes, boilers, insulation or false roofing can also be important sources. Asbestos is a hazardous product that can cause cancer in humans. It is important to realise that the air we breathe at home may not be clean always and we must try to eliminate the source of pollution. We should give due consideration to ventilation..
          </p>
          <p>
           Based on your understanding of the passage, answer ANY FIVE questions from the six given below. (1 × 5)
           <br/>
           (A) What does the writer mean by using the quote “Your smoking is injurious to my health”? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The given phrase is a witty version of ‘Smoking is injurious to health’. By this, the writer means that smoking is risky for the ‘non-smokers’ who inhale the fumes passed on by the ‘smokers’.
          </p>
          <p>
           (B) Rewrite the following sentence by replacing the underlined phrase with a word that means the same from lines 15-20.
           <br/>
           Shalini, without a doubt, is a Manchester City fan. She even got the stadium tickets to go watch the live series. (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Shalini, unequivocally, is a Manchester City fan. She even got the stadium tickets to go watch the live series.
          </p>
          <p>
           (C) State a reason for air being contaminated with noxious substances. (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The chemical industries emitting noxious substances into the air make it contaminated.
          </p>
          <p>
           (D) Why are the children of smoking parents more prone to ‘hospital admissions’? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The children of smoking parents are exposed to ETS which leads to several respiratory disorders. This is why they are more prone to ‘hospital admissions’.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           (E) List one reason as to why we should give ‘due consideration to ventilation’? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           We should give ‘due consideration to ventilation’ because on an average, we spend most of our time indoors, inhaling the trapped contaminated air.
          </p>
          <p>
           (F) How does the writer justify emphasising ventilation over eliminating the source of pollutant? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The writer justifies the given argument by saying that eliminating the sources of pollutants is not feasible as we cannot control the toxic air outside, but can release that trapped air through ventilation from our houses.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2
           <br/>
           Read the following excerpt from a case study titled “what is a healthy diet?”
           <br/>
           “What is a healthy diet?” Many clinicians find themselves at a loss to answer this common question from patients. The difficulty of offering a simple answer is understandable. The overwhelming volume of data generated by food and nutrition researchers coupled with sometimes contradictory findings, the seeming flip-flops in
          </p>
          <p>
           5. recommendations, and the flood of misinformation in diet books and the media can make it seem as though explaining the essentials of healthy eating is akin to describing the intricacies of particle physics. That is unfortunate, because there are now enough solid strands of evidence from reliable sources to weave simple but compelling recommendations about diet.
          </p>
          <p>
           10. In the United States and other developed countries, the average woman can expect to live 80 years or more. With such longevity, it isn’t enough merely to consume the calories needed to sustain the body, build it, and repair it. The foods that supply these calories can influence the risk of developing chronic conditions, which range from heart disease and cancer to osteoporosis and age-related vision loss.
          </p>
          <p>
           15. Although much remains to be learned about the role of specific nutrients in decreasing the risk of chronic disease, a large body of evidence supports the utility of healthy dietary patterns that emphasize whole-grain foods, legumes, vegetables, and fruits, and that limit refined starches, red meat, full-fat dairy products, and foods and beverages high in added sugars. Such diets have been associated with decreased risk of a variety of chronic diseases.
          </p>
          <p>
           20. Diet, of course, is just one approach to preventing illness. Limiting caloric intake to maintain a healthy weight, exercising regularly, and not smoking are three other essential strategies. Compelling data from the Nurses’ Health Study which was collected through a questionnaire of 5 questions shared with 100 respondents, show that women who followed a healthy lifestyle pattern that includes these four strategies were 80% less likely to develop cardiovascular disease over a 14-year period. The responses were tabulated (Table 1), for analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
           Table-1: Awareness level among respondents
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 10 English Term 2 Set 2 1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-133112" height="404" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 321px) 100vw, 321px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-English-Term-2-Set-2-1.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-English-Term-2-Set-2-1.png 321w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-English-Term-2-Set-2-1-238x300.png 238w" width="321"/>
           <br/>
           25. A companion study, the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, showed that similar healthy choices were beneficial in men, even among those who were taking medications to lower blood pressure or cholesterol. Although much solid information on optimal diets has emerged, the full picture of the relationships between diet and health will take years of further research to fill in. Yet several fundamentals have been established and are unlikely to change significantly.
          </p>
          <p>
           On the basis of your understanding of the passage, answer ANY FIVE questions from the six given below. (1 × 5)
           <br/>
           (A) Why do the food researchers get data coupled with ‘contradictory findings’? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The food researchers get data coupled with ‘contradictory findings’ because the data is overwhelmingly wide and may contradict in results from person to person.
          </p>
          <p>
           (B) Comment on the approaches to prevent illness in line 20-21. (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The four approaches to prevent illness are dieting, limiting caloric intake, exercising regularly, and quitting smoking.
          </p>
          <p>
           (C) Why do researchers feel that several fundamentals have been established and are unlikely to change significantly? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The researchers feel so because there are many fundamentals of diet which have been studied upon for years and have been proven clinically as well.
          </p>
          <p>
           (D) Justify the researchers’ suggestions of healthy dietary patterns leading to low risk of chronic diseases. (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Researchers have done several studies over the years which provided them with a large body of evidence that healthy dietary patterns lead to decreased chronic diseases in people.
          </p>
          <p>
           (E) Healthy diet helps to prevent the risk of cardiovascular diseases. How does evidence from Table 1 support this statement? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In Table 1, we can see that the number of healthy eaters is more than the people who don’t eat healthy diet on a daily basis. This leads to 80% of people saying ‘no’ to ever being diagnosed with cardiovascular diseases.
          </p>
          <p>
           (F) What purpose does the ‘Can’t Say’ column serve in Q1 of the questionnaire (Table 1)? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The ‘Can’t Say’ column is for the people who are unsure of the parameters of the diet being healthy.

           Write a paragraph in not more than 120 words, analysing the listed situations due to the global pandemic. (5)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In recent times, people had become more conscious about their health and started • to change their lifestyle. Doing yoga, going to a gym, seeking alternative therapies are some of the activities that people of all age groups indulge in to keep themselves fit and healthy. Moreover, after a stressful day, it is considered a good idea to unwind by going to theatre with friends or family. Flowever, COVID-19 has drastically changed the way we live today.
          </p>
          <p>
           Due to the global pandemic, all these activities have become the things of the past. Keeping indoors is the new norm to be healthy. What about those outdoor enthusiasts who miss their routine of going for a morning walk or weekly outings with friends? The sports industry is on the top of the list, getting badly affected due to the restrictions on sports activity.
          </p>
          <p>
           But we can still take care of our health by indulging in some activities that we can do at home. You can exercise in the garden or backyard of the house. Those who live in apartments can walk in the balcony or on terrace. Doing pranayama or breathing exercises is also highly beneficial in keeping us fit. Furthermore, there are many apps that provide online classes in yoga and other workouts both free and paid. So while we hope for the good time to return, let’s not miss out on our favourite activities.

           Explanation:
           <br/>
           (a) The students plucked both the flowers and the fruits, not any one of them. Hence, this is the right answer.
           <br/>
           (b) ‘As’ both the things were in plenty, the students were fighting to get them. All makes no sense here. Hence, this is the right answer.
           <br/>
           (c) The teacher didn’t call any specific student. It could be any random person. Hence, this is the right answer.

           (B) Bholi’s evolution from a ‘dumb cow’ to saying ‘no’ to marry Bishamber was a great journey. Examine her journey highlighting her stand for herself. (4)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The journey of Bholi’s evolution from a ‘dumb cow’ to a ‘masterpiece’ clearly showcases the idea of being an individual who is not being exploited by people or circumstances. Initially, Bholi was considered a simpleton and people compared her to a dumb cow. Bholi could not speak till she was five, and when at last she learnt to speak, she stammered. Children made fun of her which had an adverse effect on her self-confidence. Bholi’s teacher understood her need for love and gently guided her. Under her teacher’s gentle guidance, Bholi blossomed into a confident young girl who believed in her own self-worth. Eventually, she was able to stand up for herself and raise her voice against the social evil of dowry. Hence, she at once said no to the proposal of the greedy Bishambhar who asked money to marry her.

           (C) It is a bitter truth that death is immortal and would come to all. Evaluate the chapter ‘Sermon at Benaras’ with reference to the given statement. (4)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In the chapter, ‘Sermon at Benaras’, Kisa Gotami was completely beset with grief after the loss of her only son. All the people made her learn that her grief and lament could not bring his son back to life. She has to bear the loss to live in peace. Yet, Kisa failed to learn the lesson. Then, to get his son back, Kisa went to Buddha, who told her to get mustard seed from a house that had never lost any one to death and once she would get that, he would bring her son back to life.
          </p>
          <p>
           When she went looking for the mustard seeds, she learnt that each house had lost a loved one to death. She finally learnt in the second time that if one wants peace, then he/she must get rid of lamentation, complaint and grief as death is immortal and would come to all.
