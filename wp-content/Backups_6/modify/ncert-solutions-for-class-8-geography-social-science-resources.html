           <br/>
           “Rahiman paani raakhiye,
           <br/>
           Bin paani sab soon.
           <br/>
           Paani gaye na ubere Mod, manus, choon…”
           <br/>
           [Says Rahim, keep water, as without water there is nothing. Without water pearl, swan and dough cannot exist.] These lines were written by the poet Abdur Rahim Khankhanam, one of the nine gems of Akbar’s court. What kind of resource is the poet referring to? Write in 100 words what would happen if this resource disappeared?
           <br/>
           Answer.
           <br/>
           The resource referred to by the poet is the water. It is one of the most indispensable resources of life. It can be said to be one of the preconditions of life, like air. Firstly, water serves the most basic purpose of drinking, without which life is not possible. In the absence of water, one would be unable to clean clothes, utensils, or even take a bath. Farmers depend on water for irrigation. Rainwater is so important for proper agriculture. Water is also used in cooking food. Nowadays water has proved to be a useful source of electricity. Besides human beings, plants require water for their growth. Water is also required for various industrial purposes in factories. In short, no form of life can go on without water.

          </h4>
          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Explain the terms of resource conservation and sustainable development.
           <br/>
           Answer.
           <br/>
           Resource conservation is the concept of using resources carefully so that they do not end up quickly. The future generations also need the resources, but if we keep using them at a fast pace, they may end up, thus posing problems for the future. We should use resources in such a balanced way that we satisfy our needs as well as conserve them for the future. This concept is called sustainable development.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Why are human beings resources?
           <br/>
           Answer.
           <br/>
           Human beings are intelligent living beings. They can use their intelligence to realise the utility of substances. Had there been no humans, the resources would not have been resources. Human beings are interdependent on each other, and they prove useful to each other. For example, a postman renders us an important service, so he is a resource.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Explain how resources are classified broadly.
           <br/>
           Answer.
           <br/>
           Resources are broadly classified into natural, human-made and human. Natural resources are those that are taken from nature. They are used without modifying them, i.e. in the same form as they exist in. Rivers, lakes, air, soils, minerals, trees, mountains, etc. are natural resources. Human-made resources have not been provided to us by nature. Human beings have used their intelligence to manufacture them for their own use. Examples include vehicles, buildings, roads, telephones, etc.
           <br/>
           Human resources include people who serve us in any way. A teacher, doctor, carpenter, cobbler, etc. are human resources.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Write a short note on the significance of time and technology in making a substance a resource.
           <br/>
           Answer.
           <br/>
           Time and technology are important factors in making substances resources. With time, technology develops. As technology develops, we begin to discover new ways to make life better. In this process, certain substances which were useless to us earlier become useful. An invention and discovery give us new resources. An example is a hydroelectricity. This technology has made water a source of electricity.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           As human beings, how can we ensure sustainable development?
           <br/>
           Answer.
           <br/>
           Since we live on the earth, it is our duty to practice sustainable development. We can do this by ensuring that:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The usage of renewable resources is sustainable,
           </li>
           <li>
            The diversity of life on earth is maintained,
           </li>
           <li>
            The damage caused to nature by our activities is’as Tow as possible.
           </li>

          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Describe how resources are classified.
           <br/>
           Answer.
           <br/>
           Resources are broadly classified into natural, human-made, and human. Natural resources are those that are taken from nature. They are used without modifying them, i.e. in the same form as they exist in. Rivers, lakes, air, soils, minerals, trees, mountains, etc. are natural resources. Human-made resources have not been provided to us by nature. Human beings have used their intelligence to manufacture them for their own use. Examples include vehicles, buildings, roads, telephones, etc.
           <br/>
           Human resources include people who serve us in any way. A teacher, doctor, carpenter, cobbler, etc are human resources.
          </p>
          <p>
           On the basis of level of development, a resource can be actual or potential. An actual resource is one which is used currently. We know their quantity. A potential resource is one whose utility is not known at present or is not used despite having utility; instead, it may be useful at some time in the future. It means that it has the potential to have utility, although it does not have any today.
          </p>
          <p>
           On the basis of origin, a resource can be abiotic or biotic. Abiotic resource is one that has life. Anabiotic resource is non-living. Natural resources may also be classified as renewable and non¬renewable. A renewable resource can be used without any risk of its ending up. They exist in unlimited quantities. On the other hand, the use of non-renewable resources needs to be controlled since once they end up, they cannot be renewed.
          </p>
          <p>
           On the basis of distribution, a resource can be ubiquitous or localised. A ubiquitous resource is found everywhere. A localised resource is however found in certain parts of the world only.
