          </div>
          <p>
           The Tehri Dam has been the object of protests. Environment activist Shri Sunder Lai Bahuguna led the “Anti Tehri Dam Movement” from 1980s to 2014. The protest was against the displacement of town inhabitants and environmental consequences of the weak ecosystem. The relocation of more than 1,00,000 people from the area has led to protracted legal battles over resettlement rights and ultimately resulted in the delayed completion of the project. (2020)
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           How is hydropower harnessed?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Potential energy of water stored in a dam is converted into kinetic energy of falling water and then, this kinetic energy is converted into electrical energy.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Define 1 MW.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           1 MW is the power consumed or dissipated by a device which consumes or dissipates 1 mega joule of energy per second.

           <br/>
           Mention two disadvantages of constructing Tehri Dam.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           For the construction of Tehri Dam, relocation of more than 100000 people was needed which led to widespread protests and legal battles. Also large ecosystems were destroyed when it submerged under the water in dams causing emission of large amounts of methane which is a green-house gas.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           What happens when water from great heights is made to fall on blades of turbine?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When water from great heights is made to fall, the potential energy of these waters get converted into kinetic energy and when it falls on the blades of turbines, it rotates the turbine of a generator, thus producing electricity.

          <p>
           Working of the biogas plant:
           <br/>
           Dung and domestic/agricultural wastes are mixed with water in the mixing tank. The slurry so obtained is fed into the digester through the inlet chamber. Gradually, the anaerobic fermentation sets in and biogas is produced. It takes about 6-8 weeks for a new biogas plant to start producing biogas at a reasonably fast rate. When the pressure of biogas inside the dome increases, it starts pushing the spent slurry into the outlet chamber, and finally into the overflow tank. The spent slurry being a rich source of plant nutrients is used as a manure in agricultural fields.
          </p>
          <p>
           Biogas can be taken out for supply by spinning the gas valve. To make the biogas plant run continuously, dung slurry is fed into the digester and the spent slurry is removed from it from time to time.
          </p>
          <p>

           Answer question numbers 21-24 on the basis of your understanding of the following paragraph and the related studied concepts :
           <br/>
           Geothermal energy is the energy produced by the heat of molten rocks formed in the deeper hot regions of the earth’s crust. This energy is harnessed to generate electricity. When water is made to flow deep underground in the rocks it returns as steam (or hot water, which is later converted to steam) to drive a turbine on an electric power generator.
           <br/>
           In India, exploration and study of geothermal fields started in 1970. The Geological Survey in India has identified 350 geothermal energy locations in the country. The most promising of these is in Puga valley of Ladakh. The estimated potential for geothermal energy in India is about 10000 MW. There are seven geothermal provinces in India namely the Himalayas, Sohna, West coast, Cambay, Son-Narmada-Tapi; Godavari and Mahanadi. Most power station in India produce Alternating Current (AC).

           Question 30.
           <br/>
           Differentiate between energy obtained by burning fossil fuels and that obtained as solar energy. (Board Term I, 2017, 2013)
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The reserves of fossil fuels are limited, i.e., exhaustible whereas solar energy is available in abundance (and that too without any cost), i.e., it is inexhaustible.
           </li>
           <li>
            Fossil fuels cause pollution on burning whereas solar energy is pollution free.
           </li>
           <li>
            Fossil fuels can provide energy at any required time whereas solar energy becomes unavailable when the sky is covered with clouds.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Question 31.
           <br/>
           Define the process of nuclear fission. Write the steps involved in generating electricity in a nuclear reactor. (Board Term I, 2016)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The phenomenon of splitting up of a heavy nucleus, on bombardment with slow speed neutrons, into two fragments of comparable mass, with the release of two or more fast moving neutrons and a large amount of energy is known as nuclear fission.
           <br/>
           Steps involved in generating electricity:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Large atoms like uranium or plutonium are bombarded by slow moving neutron.
           </li>
           <li>
            Large atoms break and releases lots of heat energy.
           </li>
           <li>
            This heat is used to boil water to steam.
           </li>
           <li>
            This steam rotates the turbine which produces electricity.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Question 32.
           <br/>
           Name the three forms in which energy from sea is available for our use and write one limitation of each. (Board Term I, 2016)
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Tidal Energy:
            <br/>
            Limitation : The rise and fall of water during tides is not high enough to generate electrical energy on a large scale. There are very few places suitable for building dams. It is for these reasons, the tidal energy is not likely to be a major source of energy.
           </li>
           <li>
            Wave energy:
            <br/>
            Limitation : Wave energy would be a viable proposition only where waves are very strong.
           </li>
           <li>
            Ocean thermal energy Limitation : The efficient commercial exploitation is difficult.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Question 33.
           <br/>
           Nuclear power is an excellent non-conventional source of energy. Still it is not used commonly for power generation. Why? State three reasons. (Board Term I, 2015)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Nuclear power can not be exploited easily because:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            the waste products of nuclear reactions (produced at nuclear power plants) are radioactive which keep on emitting harmful nuclear radiations for thousands of years. So, it is very difficult to store or dispose off nuclear wastes safely. Improper nuclear waste storage or disposal can pollute the environment.
           </li>
           <li>
            there is the risk of accidents in nuclear reactors (especially the old nuclear reactors). Such accidents lead to the leakage of radioactive materials which can cause serious damage to the plants, animals (including human beings) and the environment.
           </li>
           <li>
            the high cost of installation of nuclear power plants and the limited availability of uranium fuel make the large scale use of nuclear energy prohibitive.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Question 34.
           <br/>
           Explain the principle and process of converting ocean thermal energy into electricity. (Board Term I, 2014)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Principle : There is a temperature difference between the water at the surface of the sea and deep below the sea. The difference in temperature at many places is of the order of 20°C. This difference in temperature can be exploited to produce electric energy in ocean thermal energy conversion plant (OTEC).
          </p>
          <p>
           Working : In one of the methods, a low melting point liquid or fluid such as ammonia (volatile liquid) or chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) is used to run the turbine of a generator. The warm surface water is used to boil the liquid like ammonia or CFC in a heat exchanger and vapours thus formed are used to drive the turbine of the generator. In another exchanger cold water from the depth of the ocean is pumped up to condense the vapours of the ammonia again to liquid. This ammonia is reused and the cycle repeats.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 35.
           <br/>

           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           (a) Tidal energy: The energy produced by the surge of ocean water during high and low tides due to difference in sea-levels is called tidal energy. The high and low tides occur due to the gravitational pull of the moon. This causes enormous movement of water.
           <br/>
           (b) Tidal energy is harnessed by constructing a dam near the shores. During the high tides water flows into the dam and during the low tides, water flows out. This flowing water rotates the turbine, present at the opening of the dam and produces electricity.

            43. Define process of nuclear fission. Writ the steps involved in generating electricity in a nuclear reactor.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Nuclear Fission: The process in which a heavy nucleus (such as uranium, plutonium or thorium) is broken into two nearly equal fragments when bombarded with low-energy neutrons and a tremendous amount of energy is released. This process is called nuclear fission.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Steps involved in generating electricity:
           </strong>
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            The fuel rods full of uranium pellets are placed in a nuclear reactor chamber.
           </li>
           <li>
            Low-energy neutrons are bombarded on uranium fuel rod.
           </li>
           <li>
            A self-sustaining fission chain reaction starts that releases energy at a controlled rate.
           </li>
           <li>
            With this heat the reactor converts water to steam at a high temperature and pressure.
           </li>
           <li>
            This high temperature and pressure steam spins generator turbines producing electricity.
           </li>
           <li>
            The steam cools back into water, which can then be used over again.

           <strong>
            answer.
           </strong>
           Principle of working of OTEC: The water at the surface of the ocean is warmer
           <br/>
           than the water at deeper depths. This temperature difference can be used by
           <br/>
           Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) systems to generate electricity.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Working of OTEC:
           </strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            In OTEC plant, the energy of warm surface water is used to convert low i boiling point liquid ammonia into gaseous state.
           </li>
           <li>
            The vapour of ammonia at high pressure is used to spin the turbines of generators converting the Ocean thermal energy to electricity.
           </li>
           <li>
            The used vapour pass through the condenser where cold water, pumped from the deeper parts of ocean condenses ammonia vapour back into a liquid.
           </li>
           <li>
            This process is repeated again and again ,to get continuous production of electricity.
            <br/>
            Essential condition for it to operate properly: The temperature difference between the warmer water at the surface and colder water at depths up to 2 km should be 293 K (20°C) or more.

            77. Out of two solar cookers, one was covered with a plane glass slab and the other was left open. Which of the two solar cookers will be more efficient and why?
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            answer.
           </strong>
           The solar cooker which was covered with a plane glass slab would be more efficient. The glass lid allows the heat radiation from sun to enter the solar cooker but does not allow the reflected heat radiation to escape or go outside the box. Thus, heat trapped inside the box increases the temperature. Glass lid also reduces heat loss due to reflection.

           </strong>
           Hazards of nuclear wastes are:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Nuclear waste contains radioactive substances which emit harmful nuclear radiations.
           </li>
           <li>
            There is a high risk of environmental contamination.
           </li>
           <li>
            It is highly toxic.

           <strong>
            answer.
           </strong>
           Conversion of hydro energy into electrical energy
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            High rise dams are constructed on the river to obstruct the flow of water to collect it at a suitable height. The stored water has a lot of potential energy.
           </li>
           <li>
            The water from a suitable height is allowed to fall on the blades of a turbine located at the bottom of a dam through a pipe.
           </li>
           <li>
            Kinetic energy of flowing water rotates the turbine rapidly. Rotation of turbine helps the armature coil of generator to rotate rapidly in the magnetic field. Thus, hydroelectricity is generated.
            <br/>
            Limitations of hydro energy:
            <br/>
            (i) All river-sites are not suitable for construction of dams.
            <br/>
            (ii) Large ecosystems are destroyed when submerged under the water in dam.
