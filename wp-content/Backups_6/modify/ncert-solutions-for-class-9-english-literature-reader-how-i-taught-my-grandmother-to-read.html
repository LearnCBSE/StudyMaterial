            (i) A memorable holiday spent with my grandmother
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Grandmothers are more than mothers. I still remember how I spent a holiday with my grandmother. It was quite a long time since I met her. I found her standing at the village bus-stand to receive me. She was really excited. She had prepared some of my favourite dishes only for me. She took me to the fields. We stopped at the canal. What a sight! Children were diving into it from a wooden bridge. I enjoyed fresh sugarcanes. It was evening. A herd of cattle was returning home. My grandmother would not let me sleep early. She had many interesting stories to tell. She talked of her youth, her good old times and her hobbies. She kissed me affectionately before I went to bed.

           <strong>
            (ii) A Story told by my grandmother
            <br/>
           </strong>
           It is difficult to imagine a grandmother without her fanciful stories. My grandmother is a great story-teller. Her narrative skill is very real and convincing. She will make you believe even the incredible. She has stored many stories in her rpemory. Her favourite story is of Savitri and Yama. Savitri’s husband was cutting wood in the forest. He fell down from a tree and died. The God of death, Yama came to take him to the other world. Savitri would not let him come near the dead body of her husband. She remained glued to the dead body for many days. She didn’t eat and sleep. The God of death was moved. He had never seen such a devoted and determined wife. He was pleased and restored Savitri’s husband to life.

           <strong>
            (iii) The things I admire the most about my grandmother
           </strong>
           <br/>
           My grandmother is my role-model. I am very much impressed with her personality. But there are certain things which I admire the most in her character. The first thing is her sense of discipline. She is very regular and punctual. She gets up at 5 a.m. in the morning. She is ready for her prayers before 6 a.m. She has always a fixed time for everything. I like her deep faith in God. Her sense of cleanliness is extremely praiseworthy. She looks noble and dignified in her spotless white clothes. All these things make her a very pleasing and dignified personality.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            (iv) The difference between my mother and my grandmother
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Human relations generally defy comparisons. But still there are certain basic differences between my mother and my grandmother. I am also different from my mother. So is my grandmother from her daughter-in­law. Basically it is a generation gap. My grandmother is conservative. She is highly religious. She has deep faith in God and fate. But my mother is a working woman. She has a progressive outlook towards life and people. She is not so religious. She believes that everyone has a right to lead one’s own kind of life. My grandmother thinks that home and children are the most important things for any woman. My mother thinks of other things as well. She believes that a woman must have freedom to decide what is good or bad for her.

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Have you ever been on a trip to any place in India, where you didn’t know the language spoken locally? How did you feel? How did you manage to communicate?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           During my tour to Tamil Nadu, I happened to visit a small village. It is near the temple town of Kanchipuram. Actually, I went  there to buy some sarees for my mother and my elder sister. I went to a handloom shop. The shopkeeper welcomed me with folded hands and wished ‘namaskaram’. I did the same. I said ‘sarees ’. He responded by saying “ilia’ or ‘Yella or something like that. He said something to the helpers. I could not understand even a word. Many new sarees of different colours were laid before me. I picked up one and asked the price. He raised three fingers—I couldn’t make out whether he was asking for three hundred or three thousand. A man who knew some Hindi saved me from the embarrassment. I paid six thousand and bought two sarees. Only then I realised that I was a stranger in my own country and I determined to learn at least one language that is spoken in South India.

           Give reasons for your choice.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Triveni was a very popular writer in the Kannada language. Her style was easy to read and very convincing. Her stories usually dealt with complex psychological problems of ordinary people. They were always very interesting.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           (b) The grandmother never went to school. She was totally illiterate. So she could not read. Her granddaughter would read the next  episode of Kashi Yatre when the weekly Karmaveera came. The grandmother depended on her granddaughter to know the story.
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) The following two sentences state that the grandmother was desperate to know what happened in the story:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            ‘During that time, she would forget all her work and listen with the greatest concentration.’
           </li>
           <li>
            ‘So more than anybody else she was the one most interested in knowing what happened next in the story.’
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (d) Yes, the grandmother did succeed in accomplishing her desire to read. Being illiterate, she felt very dependent and helpless. She was determined to overcome that obstacle and learn the Kannada language. She made her granddaughter her teacher and did amazing amount of homework. She set Saraswati Pooja day as the deadline. She came out with flying colours. She could now read Kashi Yatre on her own.
          </p>
          <p>
           (e) Two traits that were relevant to the character of the narrator’s grandmother were:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            her determination
           </li>
           <li>
            her emotional nature
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           She was determined to learn the Kannada language to read Kashi Yatre herself. She set the deadline and accomplished the task within the stipulated time.
          </p>
          <p>
           When the narrator came, she found her grandmother in tears. Her affectionate hands touched her granddaughter’s feet. She touched her feet as a mark of respect to her teacher
          </p>
          <p>

            <br/>
           </strong>
           Respected Principal, teachers and dear friends!
           <br/>
           India’s economic achievements may be spectacular. So may be its rapid strides in space and arms. But let me ask you a question. Don’t we feel ashamed at having the maximum number of illiterates in the world? Doesn’t it make a mockery of all our achievements? I want to make, particularly my friends aware of it. I want that all of us must contribute something in bringing about a change in the lives of the illiterate adults.
          </p>
          <p>
           I feel that every unit of N.S.S. in schools must call for volunteers. The volunteers of each unit must adopt at least five villages. They must set their targets. I think two years are enough. Scatter out in the villages. Find out the illiterate adults. Be respectful and cooperative. Give them at least 20 hours a week.
          </p>
          <p>
           I want to draw the attention of all of you to the grandmother of the story ‘How I Taught My Grandmother to Read’. When an old and illiterate lady like Krishtakka can read a novel within a year, why can’t others? Let’s be like the granddaughter. Let’s be totally devoted to the cause of the illiterates. We can do wonders. A day will come when we will have not a single illiterate in India. It may take time. But that day will come.

           Question 9.
           <br/>
           You are the grandmother. How did you feel when your granddaughter gave you the novel ‘Kashi Yatre’ ? Write your feelings in your diary.
           <br/>
           To make your diary entry interesting, read the following information about what is a diary entry.
           <br/>
           A diary entry is a purely personal piece of writing. The writer expresses his/her thoughts and feelings. Reactions to incidents are generally poured out in a diary. Hence expressions that are emotionally charged are used.
           <br/>
           For example – When you are happy about something, you could start like this

           <br/>
           Today I am very happy as my mission is almost over. About a year ago I set a deadline. I didn’t want to remain dependent and helpless anymore. So I decided to cast off the curse of illiteracy. I decided to leam the Kannada alphabet. No doubt, this task would not have seen the day without the active help of my granddaughter. She acted as my teacher and I worked hard and did an amazing homework under her guidance.
          </p>
          <p>
           Today, my granddaughter has given me a copy of Triveni’s famous novel Kashi Yatre. Lord, how merciful you are ! Now I can read any novel with confidence on my own. don’t need my granddaughter to read Kashi Yatre anymore for me. I have attained self­respect and independence. It is true that if you are determined you can overcome all obstacles. And I have learnt another lesson. For learning, there is no age bar.

          <p>
           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Here is a story about Swami and his grandmother. After reading the excerpt, change it into a conversation between Swami and his Grandmother.
           <br/>
           After the night meal with his head on his granny’s lap, nestling close to her, Swaminathan felt very snug and safe in the faint atmosphere of cardamom and cloves. ‘Oh, Granny !’ he cried ecstatically. ‘You don’t know what a great fellow Rajam is.’ He told her the story of the first enmity between Rajam and Mani and the subsequent friendship.
          </p>
          <p>
           ‘You know, he has a real police dress,’ said Swaminathan. ‘Is it? What does he want a police dress for?’ asked Granny.
          </p>
          <p>
           ‘His father is the Police Superintendent. He is the master of every policeman here.’ Granny was impressed. She said that it must be a tremendous office indeed. She then recounted the days when her husband, Swaminathan’s grandfather, was a powerful sub-magistrate, in which office he made the police force tremble before him and the fiercest dacoits of the place flee. Swaminathan waited impatiently for her to finish the story. But she went on, rambled, confused, mixed up various incidents that took place at different times. ‘That will do, Granny,’ he said ungraciously. ‘Let me tell you something about Rajam. Do you know how many marks he gets in arithmetic?’
          </p>
          <p>
           ‘He gets all the marks, does he, child?’ asked Granny.
           <br/>
           ‘No silly. He gets ninety marks out of one hundred.’
           <br/>
           ‘Good. But you must also try and get marks like him…. You know, Swami, your grandfather used to frighten the examiners with his answers sometimes. When he answered a question, he did it in a tenth of the time that others took to do it. And then, his answers would be so powerful that his teachers would give him two hundred marks sometimes.
          </p>
          <p>
           ‘Oh, enough, Granny ! You go on bothering about old unnecessary stories. Won’t you listen to Rajam?’
           <br/>
           ‘Yes, dear, yes.’
           <br/>
           ‘Granny, when Rajam was a small boy, he killed a tiger.’
           <br/>
           Swaminathan started the story enthusiastically : Rajam’s father was camping in a forest. He had his son with him. Two tigers came upon them suddenly, one knocking down the father from behind. The other began chasing Rajam, who took shelter behind a bush and shot it dead with his gun.
          </p>
          <p>
           ‘Granny, are you asleep?’ Swaminathan asked at the end of the story.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Now read the dialogue and complete the conversation:

           I think, it must be a tremendous office. Do you know, your grandfather was a powerful sub­magistrate and the Police Force trembled before him? Even the fiercest dacoits of the place fled.

           That will do, Granny. It’s so boring. Let me tell you something about Raj am. Do you know how many marks he gets in arithmetic?

           Grandmother: He gets all the marks, doesn’t he, child?

           No silly! He gets ninety marks out of one hundred.

            Grandmother:

           That’s good. But you must also try and get marks like him. Do you know how your grandfather used to frighten the examiners with his answers sometimes? He would answer a question in a tenth of the time that others took. He would give so powerful answers that his teachers gave him two hundred marks sometimes.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Swarni:

           Oh, enough, Granny! Don’t bother about old unnecessary stories. Won’t you listen to Rajam?

           <strong>
            Grandmother:

           Yes, dear, Yes.

            Swarni:

           Granny, do you know when Rajam was a small boy, he killed a tiger? His father was camping with him in a forest. Two tigers came upon them suddenly. One knocked down the father from behind. The other began chasing Rajam. He took shelter behind a bush and shot it dead with his gun. Granny, are you asleep?

           Grandmother had a keen desire to read. To achieve success in her desire, she worked very hard. She read, repeated, wrote and recited, i.e., she did everything that the lesson demanded. Her capacity to do the homework was ‘amazing’. She showed that there is no age-bar for learning.

           One understands the importance of something only ,when it is not present in one’s life.Due to society’s restrictions, Krishtakka could not study at the right age. But she always missed studying and learning. She realized the importance of education, especially when she found herself to be completely dependent on her granddaughter. She felt helpless when she couldn’t read ‘Karmaveera’. She made her granddaughter literate despite her being a girl. She did so keeping in mind the void she had felt in her life all along. We can call the grandmother quite radical, liberal and modern in making her children and grandchildren literate when she herself had been the victim of society’s restrictions.

           Grandmother was an old lady of sixty-two. She decided that she would learn to read so that she would become independent. She had set a deadline for herself and was determined to achieve it. Her willpower helped her to succeed in learning how to read. She believed that for learning, age is never an obstacle and she proved it right. Both determination and punctuality can take us a long way towards our destination. They provide us with the motivation to fight difficulties and overcome hurdles.

           Krishtakka proved to be a wonderful student.She read, repeated, wrote and recited all her lessons with great enthusiasm and concentration. Despite her age, the amount of work the grandmother did was amazing. On the day of the Dussehra festival, when she gifted her teacher (the narrator) with a frock material, the narrator also gave the grandmother a copy of ‘Kashi Yatre’ which by that time had been published in the form of a novel. When the grandmother read the novel, ‘Kashi Yatre’ and the author’s name, Triveni as well as the publisher’s name; the narrator’s joy knew no bounds and she knew that her student had passed with flying colours.

           I do agree that, ‘Education is important for all—young and old alike’. Many instances can be cited in support of this statement. Although the grandmother was unlettered and unschooled, she realized the importance of reading and took a keen interest in literature. Secondly, she was fully aware of the drawback of being an illiterate.
           <br/>
           So she made it a point to ensure that her children and grandchildren studied well. She herself resolved to learn to read and write at the age of sixty-two so that she could be independent. It was all because she knew well that an educated person does not have to depend on others. Education helps one to gain confidence and opens the door for new opportunities. •

           <br/>
           She identified herself with the protagonist of the novel and followed her story with great interest. Both have a compassionate nature and the spiritual learning; Both are the epitome of love, determination, will power and dedication.The narrator, Sudha herself is a twelve year old girl and has developed a bond with her grandmother. She too-is sincere and hard working. As a loving teacher, she gifts her student ‘Kashi Yatre’.She too is caring and respects the feelings of her grandmother. Thus, all the three characters leave a permanent impression of dedication, sacrifice and love on the reader’s mind,

           Dear Ramanatham,
           <br/>
           How are you? I am fine here.I wanted to share my experience of learning how to read at this age. It is a dream come true for me. I am unable to express my joy tor being able thread and write. Now I am not dependent on ‘ anyone.
           <br/>
           I realized the importance of reading when I could not read ‘Kashi Yatra’ in the absence of Sudha. I felt handicapped and dependent at that time. It was then that I decided to learn to read and write. I set myself a target- date. With my strong will power and determination and undoubtedly with Sudha’s diligent labour, I achieved my target 3 before Saraswati Pooja on Dussehra.
           <br/>
           Today, I am able to read quite well. I shall always be indebted to Sudha. She has helped me realize my goal and raised my self-esteem.

           The principal character of ‘Kashi Yatre’ had an ardent desire to go to Kashi and worship Lord Vishweshwara.The grandmother had a similar wish as it was a popular belief that worshipping Lord Vishweshwara in Kashi was the ultimate punya.
           <br/>
           In the story, there was an orphan girl, who wanted to marry but had no money. The old lady gave all the money she had saved for her Kashi visit to the girl. This act of sacrificing pleased the grandmother the most. She identified herself with the protagonist of the novel and followed her story with great interest. Her compassionate nature and the spiritual learning endeared her to the grandmother.

           You will be glad to know that I’ve taught my grandmother to read.I wanted to share my experience of helping my grandmother become literate with you.
           <br/>
           You know, granny was very fond of the novel ‘Kashi Yatre’. She would listen with great interest and full concentration when I would read out the story to her. Thereafter, she would discuss the story with her friends. However, when I came to visit you last month, there was no one whom she could ask to read out the story for her. She felt disappointed as she was illiterate. The reason behind her illiteracy is not lack of interest but the fact that people in those days did not give much importance to girl’s education. On her request, I taught her the Kannada alphabet. Now she is able to read as well as write.Really it is very satisfying to teach others.You too should try it.

           Dear Triveni,
           <br/>
           I wish to thank you for the way, unknowingly, you have brought about a change in my life.I am an avid reader of your novel ‘Kashi Yatre’.
           <br/>
           My granddaughter would read out the weekly episode to me. I enjoyed the story as I could identify myself with the novel’s main character, an old woman who did not go to Kashi as she had sacrificed her savings for the orphan girl’s marriage.
           <br/>
           When my granddaughter was away, I could not find out what was going on in the story as there was no one who could read it for me. I then decided that I too would learn how to read.With her help, I soon learnt the Kannada alphabet, and now am able to read quite well.
           <br/>
           All this would not have happened, and I would have remained illiterate, if you had not written such interesting and inspiring stories.
           <br/>
           Thanking you once again.
           <br/>
           Yours sincerely,
           <br/>
           Krishtakka

           Dear friends, good evening. I want to stress upon you that age is no bar when it comes to learning. I was born at a time when it was not necessary to educate the girls. I got married when I was quite young and had children at a very young age. I became busier with the coming of my grandchildren. Like other people, I too was fond of ‘Kashi Yatre’.Since I could not read, my granddaughter read it aloud for me but her week long absence made me realize my dependence on her. It was then that I decided to team Kannada. I set Saraswati pooja during Dussehra festival as my deadline.I put in a lot of hard work. My granddaughter proved to be a good teacher. She undertook the task of making a 62 year old woman literate. 1 achieved the target I had set for myself. There is nothing impossible, you just need strong willpower and determination to make it possible.
           <br/>
           Thank you.
          </p>

           <br/>
           The Grandmother was an old lady of sixty-two. She was uneducated as she had never been to school. She regretted her illiteracy when her granddaughter went to attend a wedding ceremony. At that moment, she felt helpless and dependent as she could not read ‘Karmaveera’ on her own. She didn’t know how to read. This incident brought a change in her life. She decided that she would learn to read so that she would become independent. Her will power arid firm determination helped her and she succeeded in learning to read. She believed that ‘for learning, age is never an obstacle’ and she proved it right. She was a traditional lady who believed in touching the feet of God, elders and teachers; that’s why, on Dussehra festival, she touched the feet of her granddaughter as a mark of respect towards her teacher.To sum up, she was an affectionate lady with great will-power and firm-determination.
