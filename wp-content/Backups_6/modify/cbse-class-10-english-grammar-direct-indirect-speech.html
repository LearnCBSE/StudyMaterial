           CBSE Class 10 English Grammar – Direct And Indirect Speech
          </h2>
          <p>
           (Statements, Commands, Requests, and Questions)
           <br/>
           The words spoken by a person can be reported in two ways—Direct and Indirect. When we quote the exact words spoken by a person, we call it Direct Speech.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Sohan said to Mohan, “I am going to school.”
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           The exact words spoken by Sohan are put within inverted commas. But when we give the substance of what Sohan said, it is called the Indirect Speech.
          </p>

            Direct and Indirect Speech
           </a>
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Sohan told to Mohan that he (Sohan) was going to school.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           1. Reporting Clause and Reported Speech:
           <br/>
           Sohan told Mohan that he was going to school. The words which generally come before the inverted commas are called the reporting clause, i.e. Sohan said to Mohan and the verb ‘said’, is called the reporting verb. The words spoken by Sohan and put within inverted commas are called the reported speech, i.e. “I am going to school.”
          </p>
          <p>
           2. Rules for Changing Direct Speech into Indirect Speech:
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <ul>
           <li>
            In the Indirect speech, no inverted commas are used.
           </li>
           <li>
            The conjunctions that, if, whether, are generally used after the reporting verb.
           </li>
           <li>
            The first word of the reported speech begins with a capital letter.
           </li>
           <li>
            The tense of the reporting verb is never changed.
           </li>
           <li>
            The reporting verb changes according to sense: it may be told, asked, inquired
           </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
           3. Rules for the Change of Pronouns:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The first person pronouns (I, me, my, we, us, our) in the reported speech change according to the subject of the reporting verb.
           </li>
           <li>
            The pronouns of the second person (you, your, yourself) in the reported speech change according to the object of the reporting verb.
           </li>
           <li>
            The pronouns of the third person do not change.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           <strong>
            For example:
           </strong>
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <ol>
           <li>
            He said, “I like the book.”
            <br/>
            He said that he liked the book.
           </li>
           <li>
            He said to me, “Do you like the book?”
            <br/>
            He asked me if I liked the book.
           </li>
           <li>
            He said, “He likes the book.”
            <br/>
            He said that he liked the book.
           </li>

          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           The reporting verb “say’ is changed into ask, inquire,
          </p>
          <p>
           The interrogative sentence is changed into a statement by placing the subject before the verb and the full stop is put at the end of the sentence.
          </p>
          <p>
           If the interrogative sentence has a wh-word (who, when, where, how, why, etc) the wh-word is repeated in the sentence. It serves as conjunction.
          </p>
          <p>
           If the interrogative sentence is a yes-no answer type sentence (with auxiliary verbs am, are, was, were, do, did, have, shall, etc), then ‘if or ‘whether’ is used as a conjunction.
          </p>
          <p>
           The auxiliaries do, does, did in a positive question in the reported speech are dropped.
          </p>
          <p>
           The conjunction is not used after the reporting clause.
