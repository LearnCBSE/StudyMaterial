             Answer:
            </strong>
           </span>
           (i) Today is an era of specialization. Competitive advantage can be realized only when businesses become more efficient in their operations and reduce the cost of their inefficiencies. Give the best to the society.
           <br/>
           The need of an expert professional services realized by most of the successful organizations whether small or large in the following form:
           <br/>
           (а) Entrepreneurs alone cannot do justice to all areas and aspect of business like – production, distribution, marketing, legal, researching, accounting, human resource or product development, etc.
           <br/>
           (b) They do not have ample expertise, resources, time and energy in their hands to meet out the never ending requirements of the enterprise.
           <br/>
           (c) Entrepreneurs always work on a strategic plan to accomplish functional goals in an efficient and effective way, they need expert professional services.
           <br/>
           (d) In addition to their professional expertise, these are trusted business advisors, experts and connectors. They can be considered as the most important to entrepreneurs growing company and success.
           <br/>
           Thus, either outsourcing or availing healthy mix of various professional services from outside the firm, has become a major trend in human resources, and entrepreneur started considering the need of expert professional services as a basic need for an entrepreneur.
           <br/>
           (ii) Efficient utilization of human resources means fuller utilization of resources. In an organization, human resources are the most important element and the effective utilization of other resources depends upon the quality of human resources. It also helps an entrepreneur in exploitation of natural, physical, financial resources in a better way. It is the foremost responsibility of an entrepreneur/human resource to:
           <br/>
           (a) Finding out the total amount of works to be done and then dividing it into different sets of activities.
           <br/>
           (b) The total number of tasks and jobs required to be accomplished under different activities.
           <br/>
           (c) How much work can an average person do in a specified period of time? Secondly: An entrepreneur make a manning table/organisation chart to determine: How many people, at what level, in what positions and what kind of experience and training would be required to provide organizational environment and to meet its objectives.
           <br/>
           Thirdly: Other ways by which human resources can be developed and led to performance depending upon the total structure, local climate and motivational factor like providing scope for participation, rewards and scope for performance and the futuristic needs of the organisation with the help of all the workforce involved in the operation of the business like:
           <br/>
           1.
           <strong>
            Managerial Staff:
           </strong>
           Framing policies, objectives goals, etc. for the enterprise, ensuring their implementation and finally getting the work done from workers is the field area of this category.
           <br/>
           2.
           <strong>
            Non-managerial staff:
           </strong>
           The real group which effectively converts the raw material into finished goods is ‘workers’. Nature of job decides the quality and quantity of workers to be assigned.
           <br/>
           3.
           <strong>
            Trained Technical Manpower:
           </strong>
           This constitutes of people who have technological expertise and are frequently required for machinery selection, installation, supervision and operation.
           <br/>
           4.
           <strong>
            Administrative Manpower:
           </strong>
           These are a group of staff which gives support services to managerial, professional and trained staff. They are not involved in production directly but only provide assisting services in the maintenance of the enterprise.
           <br/>
           5.
           <strong>
            Professional Manpower:
           </strong>
           Chartered accountants, auditors, bankers, lawyers, who are professional experts can be outsourced by the entrepreneur if required. Small enterprises cannot afford them on their regular payrolls.
           <br/>
           Thus, efficient utilization of human resources is only possible if the entrepreneur is able to decide:
           <br/>
           (a) The total work to be done.
           <br/>

           <br/>
           2. Business Cycle: Boom period is marked by more demand, more production and thus more working capital as compared to depression phase having declaimed demands.

           (i) The entrepreneur always makes the initial investment capital available. Either he invests his personal cash or converts his assets into cash for investment. Generally, the entrepreneur very often mobilizes his personal resources for enterprise development using his private assets or from his members of the family, dear and the near ones.

           The investors from the family may not have a legal hold on the enterprise. They tend

           <strong>
            Types:
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Generally, a mentor does not get involved in the daily activities of the business. But they will stay in contact with the new business owner, and make themselves available when questions arise.
           <br/>
           At the start, the person being mentored may need more frequent meetings but as the mentee grows confident, they will need fewer contacts with the mentor. It is for the mentee to select the type of mentoring required.
           <br/>
           Mentoring thus may be classified on two grounds:
           <br/>
           (a) Mode of construction (in which way mentorship is structured)
           <br/>
           (b) Mode of delivering (in which manner mentorship is rendered).
           <br/>
           Informal:
           <br/>
           • Goals of the relationship are not specified
           <br/>
           • Outcomes are not measured
           <br/>
           • Mentor and mentee self-select on the basis of personal chemistry.
           <br/>
           Formal:
           <br/>
           • Mentor and mentee are paired based on compatibility
           <br/>
           • Goals are established from the beginning by the organization
           <br/>
           • Outcomes are measured.
           <br/>
           Delivering Mode
           <br/>
           One-on-one: This mentoring matches one mentor with one mentee.
           <br/>
           Group Mentoring: This requires a mentor to work with 4-6 mentees at one time. Online Mentoring: Mentoring relations through computerized programmes.
           <br/>
           Peer Mentoring: Mentoring relations, formally or informally with colleagues.
           <br/>
           (ii) Mentoring in itself benefits the organisation through:
           <br/>
           • Enhancing strategic business initiatives.
           <br/>
           • Encouraging retention.
           <br/>
           • Reducing turnover costs.
           <br/>
           • Improving productivity and production.
           <br/>
           • Breaking down the “silo” mentality by senior employees and in between employers and employees.
           <br/>
           • Elevating knowledge transfer from just getting information and to retaining the practical experience and wisdom gained from long-term employees.
           <br/>
           • Enhancing professional development.
           <br/>
           • Linking employees with valuable knowledge and information to other employees in need of such information.
           <br/>
           • Using own employees, instead of outside consultants, as internal experts for professional.
           <br/>
           • Development and encouraging them.
           <br/>
           • Supporting the creation or a multicultural workforce by creating relationships among diverse employees and allowing equal access to mentoring.
           <br/>
           • Creating a mentoring culture, which continuously promotes individual employee growth and development.

           <br/>
           These are the following characteristics of mentoring :
           <br/>
           1. Takes place outside a line manager-employee relationship, at the mutual consent of a mentor and the person being mentored.
           <br/>
           2. It always focuses on professional development and sometimes may go beyond the extent like outside a mentee’s area of work.

           Borrowed capital is the capital borrowed by the enterprise for the normal running of the enterprise. Its features are:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Interest:
            </strong>
            The borrowed capital has to be repaid with interest.
           </li>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Time period:
            </strong>
            The borrowed capital is to be paid back in the agreed time limit. Thus, it is the obligation of the entrepreneur.
           </li>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Right of control:
            </strong>
            The lenders of borrowed capital normally have no control over the management of the enterprise. However, some conditions are to be fulfilled by the entrepreneur.
           </li>

           It refers to a security of fixed assets given by an entrepreneur to banks and financial institutions against a sum borrowed by him. The assets mortgaged with the institution for the sanction of a loan. Except certain government schemes, banks and financial institutions require physical (asset) security to release loans.

           <br/>
           (b) Convenient: The capital can be borrowed whenever needed by the enterprises. Many financial organisations are always ready to provide it. However, the amount lend by such organisations depend on the paying capacity of the enterprise.
           <br/>
           (c) No dilution of control: Normally the financial organisations do not interfere in the matter of the enterprise. The entrepreneur is free to work even after borrowing.
           <br/>
           (d) Reputation can be encased: Higher is the reputation of the enterprise in the society; higher are the chances of obtaining capital easily. Thus, the brand name of the enterprise can be utilized.

            Limitations of borrowed capital:
           </strong>
           <br/>
           (a) Fixed period: This capital is obtained for an agreed period of time. Also the interest and the principal amount are to be paid back in a given period of time.
           <br/>
           (b) Increases obligations: The borrowed capital increases the obligation of the enterprise as the interest is to be paid periodically.
           <br/>
           (c) Depends on security: Borrowed capital is obtained against security. Such securities if not available, then the enterprise is devoid of obtaining this capital.
