           </strong>
           Marketing is the sum total of all those activities which move goods and services from the producers to the consumers.
           <br/>
           According to Philip Kotler, ‘Marketing is that social process by which individual and groups obtain what they need and want through creating offerings and freely exchanging products and services of value with others’.
           <br/>
           The three main functions of marketing are :
           <br/>
           (i)
           <strong>
            Marketing planning
           </strong>
           The marketer develops appropriate marketing plans to capture or enhance the existing market share. It provides the guidelines to achieve the marketing objectives, e.g. a marketer of colour TVs, having 2% of current market share in the country, aims at enhancing his market share *0 20% in the next three years.

            Pricing of products
           </strong>
           It refers to the amount of money which the customers have to pay to obtain a product. Price is an important factor affecting the success or failure of a product in the market. The demand for a product or service is related to its price. Generally, lower the price, higher would be the demand for the product and vice-versa.

           <strong>
            Ans
           </strong>
           . According to Philip Kotler, ‘Marketing management is an art and science of choosing target markets and getting, keeping and growing customers through creating, delivering and communicating superior customer values of management’. It refers to planning, organising, directing and control of the activities which facilitate exchange of goods and services between producers and consumers of products and services.
           <br/>
           The three main objectives of marketing management are as follows:
           <br/>
           (i)
           <strong>
            Creation of demand
           </strong>
           The marketing manager always tries to create the demand not by unfair means but by analysing the needs and wants of the customers and then producing the products, which satisfies the customer’s need.
           <br/>
           (ii)
           <strong>
            Market share
           </strong>
           Every business firm wants to capture a larger share of the market. Therefore, marketing techniques adopted by marketing manager help to get a big share in the market.
           <br/>
           (iii)
           <strong>
            Goodwill and reputation
           </strong>
           Marketing management helps a firm in building the image for its products through advertising high quality, caring for customer satisfaction, after sale service, smooth supply, etc.
