           <br/>
           Briefly explain the six physical benefits of exercise to children. [1/2 × 6 = 3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Exercise helps in healthy growth and development : Encouraging healthy life-styles in children and adolescents is important when they grow older. Participating in organized sports and games is not only of great fun but is very essential for healthy growth and development.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Exercise improves self-esteem : Self-esteem can play a great role in how children feel about themselves and also how much they enjoy things or worry about things. Exercise reduces depressive symptoms and improves self-esteem in children.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Exercise reduces blood sugar level: Lowering blood sugar level is not only the health issue of adults but also for children as they are also becoming trapped with high sugar level. Exercise is helpful in preventing sugar from accumulating in the blood by triggering muscles to receive more glucose from blood and utilize it for energy.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) Exercise helps in motor development :
           <br/>
           Exercise helps in increasing the motor development of infants and children at a very rapid pace which in due course improves in building fine movements later on in life. The movements of muscles become efficient and smooth by doing exercise in premature age; their movements turn out to be attractive.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) Exercise strengthens the heart : Exercise helps improve heart health, and can even reverse some heart disease risk factors. A child who exercises often has the lowest risk for heart disease, but any amount of exercise is beneficial.
          </p>
          <p>
           (vi) Exercise makes stronger bones, muscles and joints : Exercise is vital for strong muscles, bones and joints. Exercise may help children lower their risk of chronic pain related to muscles, bones and joints in the future. Exercise increases bone density, which helps to make bones stronger.
          </p>

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Heart size increases : The size of heart and strength of the cardiac muscles increases due to regular exercises as to the maximum extent the left ventricle adapts. The walls of the heart develop into stronger and thicker as shown in recent studies and the thickness of myocardial wall increases as well.

           (ii) Resting heart rate decreases : The resting heart rate decreases due to regular exercises. After duration of 10 week training programme, the resting heart rate may reduce up to 10 beats per minute from the normal of 72 beats per minute. The heart becomes more efficient due to regular exercises. In highly conditioned athletes the resting heart rate decreases to 30 beats/minute.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Stroke volume increases at resting conditions : The stroke volume increases at resting conditions due to regular exercises. The stroke volume at rest remains up to 50-70 ml/beat in untrained individuals; in trained individuals it ranges from-70-90 ml/beat and in the elite endurance athletes it ranges from 90-110 ml/beat.

           Question 18.
           <br/>
           What is the difference between linear and angular motion? Explain through example. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Linear motion is any motion that moves along a straight line in one direction. The direction can either be horizontal, vertical or inclined direction. Example, approach run. Angular motion is rotatory motion, it occurs when all points on a body or object move in a circular path about the same fixed central line or axis. A child swings and rotations in hammer throw are the best example.

           Question 19.
           <br/>
           What do you understand by relative strength?
           <br/>
           Explain the importance of body weight in determining relative strength. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Relative strength is strength in relation to your body weight. Relative strength have a determining importance in sports in which the athlete shifts his body in space without any additional external weight (H/J and L/J) as well as in sports in which he has to restrict his own weight within the framework of weight division (e. g. boxing, wrestling, weight lifting etc.) e.g. if 1 RM (repetition maximum) is 50 kgs and body wt. is 50 kg and if 1 RM is 70 kg and body wt. is 50 kg, in second category the relative strength is more.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Endomorphic : An Endomorphic somatotype is also known as a viscerotonic. The characteristic traits of this somatotype usually includes being relaxed, tolerant, comfortable, and sociable. Psychologically, they are also fun-loving, good humored, even-tempered, and they love food and affection. The Endomorph is physically “round”. They have wide hips and narrow shoulders that give a pear-shape.
          </p>
          <p>
           They tend to have a lot of extra fat on their body and on their arms and thighs. They have skinny ankles and wrists that make the rest of their body look even bigger.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Ectomorphic : An ectomorph is the complete opposite of the Endomorph. Physically, they have narrow shoulders, thin legs and arms, little fat on the body, a narrow face and a narrow chest. They may eat just as much as the endomorph but never seem to gain any weight. They always stay skinny. Personality wise, they tend to be self-conscious, socially anxious, artistic, thoughtful, quiet, and private. They always keep to themselves and are to branch out.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Mesomorphic : The mesomorph is in between the endomorph and thin ectomorph. They have an attractive and desirable body. Physically, they tend to have a large head and broad shoulders with a narrow waist. They have a strong muscular body and strong arms and legs and little fat on the body. They work for the body they have so that they could have an attractive body. Psychologically, the mesomorph is adventurous and courageous. They are not afraid to break out and do new things with new people. They are assertive.

           Question 24.
           <br/>
           What is movement speed? Explain the methods to develop speed endurance. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Movement speed is the time taken between the initiation of movement and the completion of the movement. It depends upon techniques, explosive strength, flexibility and coordinative abilities. It plays a vital role in boxing, gymnastics, swimming; throws and jumps etc. where the minimum time is taken to complete the movement.
          </p>
          <p>
           To develop the speed endurance we will have to work more on pace races because pace races means running the whole distance at a constant speed. Generally, 800 meters and above races are included in pace races. As a matter of fact, an athlete can run a distance of 300 meters at full speed but, in longer races such as 800 meters or above races he must conserve his energy by reducing his speed. For example, if there is a runner of 800 meter race his best time is 1 minute 40 second, so, he should run first 400 m in 49 seconds and next 400m in 51 seconds.
