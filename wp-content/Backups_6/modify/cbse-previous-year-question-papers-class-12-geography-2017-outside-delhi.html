           </li>
           <li>
            A navigable fresh canal also follows from Nile.

           Question 11.
           <br/>
           “There is no consensus on what exactly defines a village or a town.” Analyse the statement by using different criteria. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           We all live in cluster of houses which can be called as village or a town. It is widely accepted that settlements can be differentiated in terms of rural (village) and urban (town), but there is no consensus on what exactly defines a village or a town. Although population size is an important criterion, it is not a universal criteria since many villages in densely populated countries in like India and China have population exceeding than some towns of Europe and USA.
          </p>
          <p>
           In certain countries, urban settlements are defined on the economic basis. For example, in India, towns are called urban towns cities when it has 75% of its work force engaged in non-agricultural activities, whereas in some western countries an urban area is if more than 50% of the economically productive population are engaged in non-agricultural pursuits.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 12.
           <br/>
           “Nature provides opportunities and humans make use of these and slowly nature gets humanised and starts bearing the imprints of human endeavour.” Justify the statement. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When the human being makes use of opportunities provided by nature, it starts bearing the imprints of human endeavour and this situation is known as humanisation of nature. Human beings interact with their physical environment with the help of technology. Technology indicates the level of cultural development of society.
          </p>

           Knowledge about nature is extremely important to develop technology and advanced technology loosens the shackles of environment on human beings. In the early stages of their interaction with their natural environment humans were greatly influenced by it. They adapted to the dictates of nature. This is so because the level of technology was very low and the stage of human social development was also primitive. They create possibilities with the resources obtained from the environment. The human activities create the cultural landscape. The imprints of human activities are created everywhere; health resorts on highlands, huge urban sprawls, fields, orchards and pastures in plains and rolling hills, ports on the coasts, oceanic routes on the oceanic surface and satellites in the space.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Major objectives of India’s New Industrial Policy 1991 are as follows :
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            The New Industrial Policy, 1991 seeks to liberate the industry from the shackles of licensing system.
           </li>
           <li>
            Maintain a sustained growth in productivity.
           </li>
           <li>
            Encourage foreign participation in India’s industrial development.
           </li>
           <li>
            Gainful employment and attain international competitiveness.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           The process of globalisation includes opening up of world trade, development of advanced means of communication, internationalization of financial markets, growing importance of MNCs, population migrations and increased mobility of persons, goods, capital, data and ideas. It refers to the integration of economies of the world through uninhibited trade and financial flows, as also through mutual exchange of technology and knowledge. It also contains free inter-country movement of labour. This implies opening up the economy to foreign direct investment by providing facilities to foreign companies to invest in different fields of economic activity in India, removing constraints and obstacles to the entry of MNCs, allowing Indian companies to enter into foreign collaborations and also encouraging them to set up joint ventures abroad; carrying out massive import liberalisation programs by switching over from quantitative restrictions to tariffs and import duties, therefore globalisation has been identified with the policy reforms of 1991 in India.

           Question 15.
           <br/>
           “The size of a territory and per capita income are not directly related to human development.” Support the statement with examples. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Yes, it is true that the size of territory and per capita income are not directly related to human development.
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Growth of economy and productivity is generally assessed with the help of gross national product and per capital income.
           </li>
           <li>
            There are few rich and developed states like Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat and Delhi have per capita income more than ₹ 4,000/month.
           </li>
           <li>
            Poverty is reflected in poor quality of life. Hundreds of people suffer malnutrition, deprivation, illiteracy and consequent low level of human development. It does not depend upon the size of territory.
           </li>
           <li>
            Often Smaller Countries have done better than larger ones in human development. Similarly, relatively poorer nations have been ranked higher than richer neighbours in terms of human development.
            <br/>
            For example Sri Lanka, Trinidad and Tobago have a higher rank than India in the human development index despite having smaller economies. Similarly, within India, Kerala performs much better than Punjab and Gujarat in human development despite having lower per capita income.
           </li>
           <li>
            Some large states like Odisha, Bihar, MP, UP and Tamilnadu have more than 50% population below poverty line while Delhi is much smaller areawise but is a prosperous state.

           Question 16.
           <br/>
           How is migration a response to the uneven distribution of opportunities over a space ? Explain the economic consequences of migration in India. [2 + 3 = 5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Migration is a response to the uneven distribution of opportunities because of the following reasons :
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            In India many people live in rural areas and they migrate to urban areas mainly due to poverty, high population pressure on land, lack of basic infrastructural facilities like health, education, etc. This proves that migration is responsible for the uneven distribution over space.
           </li>
           <li>
            People tend to move from place of low opportunities and less safety to a place which has more opportunities and safe.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           Economic Consequences :
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            People migrating send remittance to their families at home and add to economic prosperity. Remittance from international migrants is one of the major sources of foreign exchange. In 2002, India received US $11 billion as remittances from international migrants.
           </li>
           <li>
            Remittance are used for food, repayment of debts, treatment, marriages, children education, agricultural development, construction of houses, etc. Thousands of poor villages of many states works as live blood for economy.
           </li>
           <li>
            Punjab, Kerala and Tamil Nadu receive very significant amount from their international migrants. Internal Migrants play an important role in the growth of economy of the source area.
           </li>

           Question 17.
           <br/>
           “In modem times international trade is the basis of the world economy.” Support the statement with examples. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Trade is the base of world economy. The exchange of surplus goods between different countries is called international trade. It is the index of economic development of the country. The countries which export the commodities earn foreign exchange. Developed countries are major trading countries. It also helps to raise the standards of living of the people of developing countries. Some densely populated countries have to import raw materials to meet their demands for their economic and industrial development.
          </p>
          <p>
           Such countries are Japan, Sri Lanka and other countries. The actual tonnage of goods traded makes up the volume. However, services traded cannot be measured in tonnage. Therefore, the total value of goods and services traded is considered to be the volume of trade. The total volume of world trade has been steadily rising over the past decades. Trade of primary products was dominant in the beginning of the last century. Later manufactured goods gained prominence and currently, though the manufacturing sector commands the bulk of the global trade, service sector which includes travel, transportation and other commercial services have been showing an upward trend.

           Question 18.
           <br/>
           Review any five measures adopted to solve the problems of Indian agriculture. [5 × 1 = 5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Measures adopted to solve the problems are :
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) Indian agriculture is totally dependent on monsoon. The crop production in the cultivated land is directly dependent on rainfall. Excessive rainfall causes flood and less rainfall causes drought conditions. For expansion of irrigation dams, rivers and canals have played a crucial role enhancing agriculture output in country.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The yield of the crops in country is low in comparison to international level. Output of most of the crops such as rice, wheat, cotton and oil seeds in India is much lower than that of USA, Russia, Japan. Use of modern agricultural technologies such as high yield variety of seeds, chemical fertilisers, pesticides and farm machinery are introduced in India.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) The inputs of modern agriculture are very expensive for the farmers to afford. So government is supporting them by introducing the facilities like farmer loans, machinery loans at very low interest rates.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) A large number of farmers produce crops for self consumption. These farmers do not have enough land and resources to produce more than their requirement. Government is encouraging them to use high yield seeds, fertilisers and provide it in competitive rates.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) New seed varieties of wheat (Mexico) and rice (Philippines) known as high yielding varieties (HYVs)
           <br/>
           were available for cultivation by mid-1960s. India took advantage of this and introduced package technology comprising HYVs, along with chemical fertilisers in irrigated areas of Punjab, Haryana, Western Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat.

           Question 19.
           <br/>
           Classify intensive subsistence agriculture into two categories practised in the world. How are they different from each other ? Explain. [1 + 4 = 5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Basically, there are two types of intensive subsistence agriculture :
           <br/>
           Intensive subsistence agriculture dominated by Wet paddy cultivation : This type of agriculture is characterised by dominance of the rice crop. Intensive subsistence agriculture dominated by Non Paddy crops : This type of agriculture is characterised mainly by wheat.

           Question 15.
           <br/>
           What is meant by human development ? Classify countries into four groups on the basis of the human development scores earned by them. Explain one feature of each group. [1 + 2 + 2 = 5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Human Development: The concept of human development was introduced by Dr. Mahbub-ul-Haq. Dr. Haq has described human development as development that enlarges people’s choices and improves their lives. People’s choices are not fixed but keep on changing. The basic goal of development is to create conditions where people can live meaningful lives. A meaningful life is not just a long one. It must be a life with some purpose. This means that people must be healthy, be able to develop their talents, participate in society and be free to achieve their goals.
           <br/>
           Countries can be classified into four groups on the basis of the human development scores earned by them.

           Question 18.
           <br/>
           Explain the importance of five non-conventional sources of energy with suitable examples. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Importance of non-conventional sources of energy are :
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) Solar Energy : Sun rays tapped in photovoltaic cells can be converted into energy, known as solar energy. The two effective processes considered to be very effective to tap solar energy are photovoltaics and solar thermal technology. It is cost competitive, environment friendly and easy to construct. It is generally used more in appliances like heaters, crop dryers, cookers, etc. The Western part of India has greater potential for the development of solar energy in Gujarat and Rajasthan.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Wind Energy : Wind energy is absolutely pollution free, inexhaustible source of energy. The mechanism of energy conversion from blowing wind is simple. The kinetic energy of wind, through turbines is converted into electrical energy. The permanent wind systems such as the trade winds, westerlies and seasonal winds like monsoon have been used as source of energy. Besides these, local winds, land and sea breezes can also be used to produce electricity. India, already has started generating wind energy. It has an ambitious programme to install 250 wind-driven turbines with a total capacity of 45 megawatts, in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka, favourable conditions for wind energy exists.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Tidal and Wave Energy : Ocean currents are the store-house of infinite energy. Since the beginning of seventeenth and eighteenth century, persistent efforts were made to create a more efficient energy system from the ceaseless tidal waves and ocean current. Large tidal waves are known to occur along the west coast of India. Hence, India has great potential for the development of tidal energy along the coasts but so far these have not yet been utilised.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) Geothermal Energy: When the magma from the interior of earth, comes out on the surface, tremendous heat is released. This heat energy can successfully be tapped and converted to electrical energy. Apart from this, the hot water that gushes out through the geyser wells (hot wells) is also used in the generation of thermal energy. It is popularly known as geothermal energy. This energy is now considered to be one of the key energy sources which can be developed as an alternate source. The hot springs and geysers are being used since medieval period. In India, a geothermal energy plant has been commissioned at Manikaran in Himachal Pradesh.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) Bio-energy: Bio-energy refers to energy derived from biological products which includes agricultural residues, municipal, industrial and other wastes. Bio energy is a potential source of energy conversion. It can be converted into electrical energy, heat energy or gas for cooking. It will also process the waste and garbage and produce energy. One such project converting municipal waste into energy is Okhla in Delhi.

           Question 18.
           <br/>
           What was the main aim of the ‘Tribal Sub-Plan’ introduced in 1974 in Bharmaur area ? Review its contribution in the development of the Bharmaur region. [1 + 4 = 5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The process of development of tribal area of Bharmaur started in 1970s when Gaddis were included among ‘scheduled tribes’. Under the Fifth Five Year Plan, the tribal sub-plan was introduced in 1974 and Bharmaur was designated as one of the five Integrated Tribal Development Projects (ITDP) in Himachal Pradesh. This area development plan was aimed at improving the quality of life of the Gaddis and narrowing the gap in the level of development between Bharmaur and other areas of Himachal Pradesh. This plan laid, the highest priority on development of transport, communications, agriculture and allied activities, social and community services.
          </p>
          <p>
           The most significant contribution of tribal sub plan in Bharmaur region is the development of infrastructure in terms of schools, health care facilities, potable water, roads, communications and electricity. But the villages located along the river Ravi in Holi and Khani areas are the main beneficiaries of infrastructural development. The female literacy rate in the region increased from 1.88 per cent in 1971 to 65 per cent in 2011. Traditionally, the Gaddis had subsistence agricultural-cum-pastoral economy having emphasis on food grains and livestock production. But during the last three decades of twentieth century, the cultivation of pulses and other cash crops has increased in Bharmaur region. But the crop cultivation is still done with traditional technology. The declining importance of pastoralism in the economy of the region can be gauged from the fact that at present only about one-tenth of the total households practise transhumance.
