           <br/>
           (a) Position of isotopes: All the isotopes of an element have the same number of protons, so their atomic number is also the same. Since, all the isotopes of an element have the same atomic number; they can be put at one place in the same group of the periodic table.
           <br/>
           (b) Position of Cobalt and Nickel: The atomic number of cobalt is 27 and that of nickel is 28. According to modern periodic law, the elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic numbers. So, cobalt with lower atomic number (27) should come first and nickel with higher atomic number (28) should come later, even if their atomic masses are in the wrong order.

           According to the Newlands’ law of octaves, when elements are arranged in the order of increasing atomic masses, the properties of the eighth element (starting from a given element) are a repetition of the properties of the first element.
           <br/>
           For example: If we start with lithium as the first element, we find that the eighth element from it is sodium having the similar properties to lithium.

             Solution :
            </strong>
           </span>
           <br/>
           (a)Yes,Dobereiners triads also exist in the columns of Newlands’ Octaves.
           <br/>
           Consider the elements lithium (Li), sodium (Na) and potassiu m (K) which are present in the second column of Newlands’ classification of elements. Now, if we start with lithium as the 1 st element, then the 8 th element from it is sodium, and according to Newlands’ law of octaves, the properties of 8 th element , sodium should be similar to thos e of the 1 st element, lithium. Again, if we take sodium as the 1 st el ement , then the 8 th element from it is potassium, and according to Newlands ‘ law of octaves, the properties of 8 th element, potassium should be similar to those of the 1 st element, sodium. This means that according to Newlands’ law of octaves, the elements lithium, sodium and potassium should have similar chemical properties. We also know that lithium, sodium and potassium form a Dobereiner’s triad having similar chemical properties. From this, we conclude that Dobereiners triads also exist in the columns of Newlands Octaves.
           <br/>
           (b) The main limitation of Dobereiner’s classification of elements was that it failed to arrange all the then known elements in the form of triads of elements having similar chemical properties. Dobereiner could identify only three triads from the elements known at that time. So, his classification of elements was not much successful. Another limitation was that Dobereiner failed to explain the relation between atomic masses of elements and their chemical properties.
           <br/>
           (c) Newlands’ law of octaves for the classification of elements had the following limitations:
           <br/>
           ( i ) Newlands’ law of octaves was applicable to the classification of elements up to calcium only. After calcium, every eighth element did not possess the properties similar to that of the first element. Thus, this law worked well with lighter elements only.
           <br/>
           (ii) Newlands assumed that only 56 elements existed in nature and no more elements would be discovered in the future. But later on, several new elements were discovered whose properties did not fit into Newlands’ law of octaves.
           <br/>
           (iii) In order to fit elements into his table, Newlands put even two elements together in one slot and that too in the column of unlike elements having very different properties. For example, the two elements cobalt (Co) and nickel (Ni) were put together in just one slot and that too in the column of elements like fluorine, chlorine and bromine which have very different properties from these elements.

           <br/>
           (b) Anomalies of Mendeleev’s classification of elements:
           <br/>
           (i) The position of isotopes could not be explained: If the elements are arranged according to atomic masses, the isotopes should be placed in different groups of the periodic table. But, the isotopes were not given separate places in Mendeleev’s periodic table. They were placed at the same place in the table. This placing of the isotopes at same place could not be explained by Mendeleev’s periodic law.
           <br/>
           (ii) Wrong order of atomic masses of some elements could not be explained: In Mendeleev’s periodic table, when certain elements were put in their correct group on the basis of their chemical properties, it was found that the element with higher atomic mass comes first and the element with lower atomic mass comes later. Mendeleev’s periodic law could not explain this abnormal situation of wrong order of atomic masses.

           (a) Mendeleev’s periodic law: The properties of elements are a periodic function of their atomic masses. It was the discovery of atomic number which led to a change in Mendeleev’s periodic law which was based on atomic mass.
           <br/>

           (e) Name the scientist who prepared modern periodic table.
           <br/>
           <span style="color: #eb4924;">
            <strong>
             Solution :
            </strong>
           </span>
           <br/>
           (a) The modern periodic law states that the properties of elements are a periodic fu nction of their atomic numbers.
           <br/>
           (b) When elements are arranged according to increasing atomic numbers, there is a periodicity in the electronic configurations of the elements. The elements in a period have consecutive atomic numbers. The elements having same number of valence electrons in their atoms are placed in a group. All the elements in a group have similar electronic configurations and show similar properties.
           <br/>
           (c) When the elements are arranged according to their atomic numbers on the basis of modern periodic law, then all the anomalies (or defects) of Mendeleev’s classification disappear. This is discussed below:
           <br/>
           (i) Explanation for the Position of Isotopes: All the isotopes of an element have the same number of protons, so their atomic number is also the same. Since all the isotopes of an element have the same atomic number, they can be put at one place in the same group of the periodic table. For example, both the isotopes of chlorine, Cl-35 and Cl-37, have the same atomic number of 17, so both of them can be put at one place in the same group of the periodic table.
           <br/>
           (ii) Explanation for the Position of Cobalt and Nickel: The atomic number of cobalt is 27 and that of nickel is 28. Now, according to modern periodic law, the elements are arranged in the order of increasing atomic numbers. So, cobalt with lower atomic number (27) should come first and nickel with higher atomic number (28) should come later, even if their atomic masses are in the wrong order.
           <br/>
           (iii) Explanation for the Position of Hydrogen: Hydrogen element has been placed at the top of group 1, above the alkali metals because the electronic configuration of hydrogen is similar to those of alkali metals. Both, hydrogen as well as alkali metals have 1 valence electron each.
           <br/>
           (d) Atomic number is always a simple whole number. It can either be 1 or 2. There can be no element with atomic number 1.5.
           <br/>
           (e) The modern periodic table was prepared by Bohr .

           (a) 2.
           <br/>
           For groups 1 and 2, the number of valence electrons is equal to the group number.
           <br/>
           (b) 2 .
           <br/>
           Valency is determined by the number of valence electrons present in the atom of the element.
           <br/>
           (c) 5 .
           <br/>
           For groups 13 to 18, the number of valence electrons is equal to (group no. – 10).
           <br/>
           (d) 3 .
           <br/>
           The number of electrons lost or gained by one atom of an element to achieve the nearest inert gas configuration, gives us the valency.

           <br/>
           (a) The horizontal rows of elements in a periodic table are called periods. As we move from left to right in a period, the atomic number of elements increases which means that the no. of protons and electrons in the atom increases. Due to large positive charge on the nucleus, the electrons are pulled in more close to the nucleus and the size of the atom decreases.
           <br/>
           (b) (i) On moving from left to right in a period, the chemical reactivity of elements first decreases and then increases.
           <br/>
           Example: In the 3rd period of elements, sodium is a very reactive element, magnesium is less reactive whereas aluminium is still less reactive. Silicon is the least reactive in the third period. Now, phosphorus is quite reactive, sulphur is still more reactive whereas chlorine is very reactive.
           <br/>
           (ii) On moving from left to right in a period, the basic nature of oxides decreases and the acidic nature of oxides increases.
           <br/>
           Example: In the 3rd period of the periodic table, sodium oxide is highly basic in nature and magnesium oxide is comparatively less basic. The aluminium and silicon oxides are amphoteric in nature. Phosphorus oxides are acidic, sulphur oxides are more acidic whereas chlorine oxides are highly acidic in nature.

             Solution :
            </strong>
           </span>
           <br/>
           (a) The tendency of an atom to lose electrons increases on moving down in a group of the periodic table. As we go down in group 1, one more electron shell is added at every stage and the size of the atom increases. The valence electrons become more and more away from the nucleus and hold of the nucleus on valence electrons decreases. Due to this, the atoms can lose valence electrons more easily to form positive ions and hence electropositive character increases.
           <br/>
           (b) The tendency of an atom to gain electrons decreases on going down in a group of the periodic table. When we move from top to bottom in group 17, a new shell of electrons is added to the atoms at every step, due to which the size of atom increases. The nucleus goes more deep inside the atom due to which the attraction of nucleus for the incoming electron decreases due to which the atom cannot form negative ions easily and hence the electronegative character decreases.

           (a) As we move from Na to Cl in the 3rd period, the size of the atoms of the elements decreases. Na atom is the biggest whereas Cl atom is the smallest in size. As we move from left to right in a period, the atomic no. of elements increases i.e. the number of protons and electrons in the atoms increases. Due to large positive charge on nucleus, the electrons are pulled in more close to the nucleus and thus the size of the atom decreases from Na to Cl.

             Solution :
            </strong>
           </span>
           <br/>
           (a) Modern periodic table arranges the elements according to increasing atomic numbers. So, the atomic number of cobalt (27) comes first whereas the atomic number of nickel (28) comes later.
           <br/>
           (b) In Mendeleev’s periodic table, hydrogen has been placed in group I since like alkali metals, hydrogen also combines with halogens, oxygen and sulphur to form compounds having similar formulae. This means that hydrogen resembles alkali metals in some of the properties.
           <br/>
           Hydrogen also resembles halogens in some of the properties. So, hydrogen could also be placed in group VII of halogen elements.

           (i) The elements in a group do not have consecutive atomic numbers.
           <br/>
           (ii) All the elements in a group have similar electronic configurations and show similar properties.
           <br/>
           (b) The size of atom decreases on moving from left to right in a period. As we move from left to right in a period, the atomic number of elements increases which means that the no. of protons and electrons in the atom increases. The electronic configuration of the atoms increases in the same shell. Due to large positive charge on the nucleus, the electrons are pulled in more close to the nucleus and the size of the atom decreases.
           <br/>
           On going down in a group of the periodic table, the atomic size increases. The no. of electron shells in the atoms gradually increases and the electronic configuration also increases due to which the atomic size increases.

           In group 1 of alkali metals, lithium is the least metallic element whereas francium is the most metallic element.

           <br/>
           (b) Why do elements in the same group show similar properties but the elements in different groups show different properties ?

            <strong>
             Solution :
            </strong>
           </span>
           <br/>
           (a) The 1st period has two elements because the 1st electron shell of an atom c a n take a maximum of two electrons only. The 2nd period of the periodic table has 8 electrons because the maximum no. of electrons which can be put in the 2nd shell of an atom is 8.
           <br/>
           (b) The elements in the same group show similar properties because they have similar electronic configuration (having the same number of valence electrons) whereas the elements of different groups have different electronic configurations (different number of valence electrons) due to which they show different properties.
           <br/>
           (c) (i) F; Br
           <br/>
           (ii) Li; Li
           <br/>
           (d) Fluorine and chlorine have been placed in the same group because both of them have 7 valence electrons.
           <br/>
           (e) Merits of modern periodic table:
           <br/>
           (i) The modern periodic table is based on the atomic numbers of elements which is the most fundamental property of elements.
           <br/>
           (ii) It helps us to understand why elements in a group show similar properties but elements in different groups show different properties.
           <br/>
           (iii) It explains the reasons for the periodicity in properties of elements.
           <br/>
           (iv) It tells us why the properties of elements are repeated after 2, 8, 18 and 32 elements.

             Question 36:
            </strong>
           </span>
           <br/>
           (a) What is a group in the periodic table ? In which part of a group would you separately expect the elements to have (i) the greatest metallic character (ii) the largest atomic size ?
           <br/>
           (b) In what respects do the properties of group 1 elements differ from those of group 17 elements ? Explain with examples by taking one element from each group.
           <br/>
           (c) From the standpoint of atomic structure, what determines which element will be the first and which the last in a period of the periodic table ?
           <br/>
           (d) Explain why, the properties of elements are repeated after 2, 8,18 and 32 elements in the periodic table.
           <br/>
           (e) What are the advantages of the periodic table ?
           <br/>
           <span style="color: #eb4924;">
            <strong>
             Solution :
            </strong>
           </span>
           <br/>
           (a) The vertical columns in a periodic table are called groups.
           <br/>
           (i) The greatest metallic character is found in the elements in the lowest part of the group.
           <br/>
           (ii) The largest atomic size is found in the lowest part of the group.
           <br/>
           (b) Group 1 elements have 1 valence electron and are ionic in chemical reactions. Their chemical reactivity increases down the group. They are electropositive in nature and it increases down the group.
           <br/>
           Whereas, the elements of group 17 have 7 valence electrons. They all are non-metals. Their chemical reactivity decreases down the group. They are electronegative in nature and it decreases down the group.
           <br/>
           (c) The no. of valence electrons in the atoms of elements decides which element will be the 1st element in a period and which will be the last in a period.
           <br/>
           (d) The properties of elements are repeated after 2, 8, 18 and 32 elements in the periodic table because the electronic configurations of the elements are repeated in this manner.
           <br/>
           (e) Advantages of the periodic table:
           <br/>
           (i) It has made the study of chemistry systematic and easy.
           <br/>
           (ii) It is easier to remember the properties of an element if its position in the periodic table is known.
           <br/>
           (iii) The type of compounds formed by an element can be predicted by knowing its position in the periodic table.
           <br/>
           (iv) It is used as a teaching aid in chemistry in schools and colleges.
