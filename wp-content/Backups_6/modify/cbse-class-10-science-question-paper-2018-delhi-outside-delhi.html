          <p>
           Which species is likely to have comparatively better chances of survival. Sexually reproducing organisms have better chances of survival because sexual reproduction involves the fusion of two gametes (male and female) and the zygote so formed contains the DNA from two different members of the species. This causes more variations. The variations allow the individuals to adapt under varied environmental conditions for better chances of survival.

           <br/>
           (i) First law. The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane.
           <br/>
           (ii) Second law. The ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of refraction is constant for a given pair of media. The second law of refraction is called Snell’s law.
           <br/>
           Mathematically, it can be written as:
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Class 10 Science Question Paper 2018 (Delhi &amp; Outside Delhi) with Solutions Img 13" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-164545" height="50" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CBSE-Class-10-Science-Question-Paper-2018-Delhi-Outside-Delhi-with-Solutions-Img-13-1.png" width="149"/>
           <br/>
           Absolute refractive index of a medium. When light goes from vacuum to another medium, then the value of refractive index is called absolute refractive index. It is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum or air to the speed of light in the medium.
           <br/>
           Absolute refractive index (n) = \(\frac { Speed of light in vaccum }{ Speed of light in medium }\)

           Question 13.
           <br/>
           (a) List the factors on which the resistance of a conductor in the shape of a wire depends.
           <br/>
           (b) Why are metals good conductors of electricity whereas glass is a bad conductor of electricity? Give reason.
           <br/>
           (c) Why are alloys commonly used in electrical heating devices? Give reason.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Factors on which the resistance of a conductor in the shape of a wire depends:
           <br/>
           (i) The resistance of a straight conductor is directly proportional to its length.
           <br/>
           R ∝ 1 …(i)
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The resistance of a straight conductor is inversely proportional to its area of cross-section.
           <br/>
           R ∝ \(\frac{l}{A}\)
           <br/>
           From (i) and (ii)
           <br/>
           R ∝ \(\frac{l}{A}\)
           <br/>
           ∴ R = ρ\(\frac{l}{A}\) ….[ρ = constant called resistivity
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) The resistance of a conductor also depends upon the temperature of the conductor and nature of material used.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) • Metals have free electrons which helps them in the conduction of electricity whereas glass has no free electrons therefore it is an insulator.
           <br/>
           • The resistivity of glass is very high (= 10
           <sup>
            10
           </sup>
           to 10
           <sup>
            14
           </sup>
           Ω m) therefore it is a poor conductor of electricity whereas the resistivity of metals is low, therefore metals are good conductors of electricity.
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) Alloys are commonly used in electrical heating devices because —
           <br/>
           • the resistivities of alloys are much higher than those of the pure metals (from which they are made);
           <br/>
           • an alloy does not undergo oxidation (or burn) easily even at high temperatures. Thus heating elements of electrical heating appliances such as electric iron, toaster, etc. are made of an alloy rather than a pure metal.
          </p>

           Question 14.
           <br/>
           Students in a school listened to the news read in the morning assembly that the mountain of garbage in Delhi, suddenly exploded and various vehicles got buried under it. Several people were also injured and there was traffic jam all around. In the brain storming session the teacher also discussed this issue and asked the students to find out a solution to the problem of garbage. Finally they arrived at two main points – one is self management of the garbage we produce and the second is to generate less garbage at individual level.
           <br/>
           (a) Suggest two measures to manage the garbage we produce.
           <br/>
           (b) As an individual, what can we do to generate the least garbage? Give two points.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Measures to manage the garbage we produce:
           <br/>
           • (i) Fruits and vegetable peels can be converted into paste and can be used as manure in potted plants and fields to increase soil fertility.
           <br/>
           (ii) Use your own reusable cloth bags instead of accepting plastic bags from the stores to carry items.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) As an individual, we can adopt the following methods:
           <br/>
           (i) Encourage recycling, it means that we should collect the used and discarded items of paper, plastic, glass and metals, and send them to the respective industries for making fresh paper, plastic, glass or metal objects.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Encourage reuse, which means, if possible, we should use the same things again, for example, the plastic or glass jars in which we buy various food items like jam, etc. can be used later on for storing things like salt, pulses, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 15.
           <br/>
           What is a dam? Why do we seek to build large dams? While building large dams, which three main problems should particularly be addressed to maintain peace among local people? Mention them.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Dams are man-made structures constructed across rivers with the aim of controlling, collecting and diverting the flow of water in rivers.
          </p>
          <p>
           We seek to build large dams because the large reservoirs of dams store a huge amount of water brought in by the flowing rivers which is used to irrigate large cultivated land, to supply water in the cities through pipelines after treatment and to generate hydroelectricity. The construction of high-rise-dams creates certain problems for the local people:
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) Social problems. Due to construction of high rise dams, a large number of human settlements are submerged in the water of large reservoirs formed by the dam and many people are rendered homeless.
           <br/>
           (ii) Environmental problems. A vast variety of flora and fauna get submerged in the water of large reservoirs formed by the dam and this disturbs the ecological balance.
           <br/>
           (iii) Economic problems. Construction of high rise dams involves the spending of huge amount of public money without the generation of proportionate benefits to the local community.

           Question 16.
           <br/>
           (a) Write the steps involved in the extraction of pure metals in the middle of the activity series from their carbonate ores.
           <br/>
           (b) How is copper extracted from its sulphide ore? Explain the various steps supported by chemical equations. Draw labelled diagram for the electrolytic refining of copper.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) • Some of the moderately reactive metals occur in nature as their carbonates. It is easier to obtain metals from their oxides (by reduction) than from carbonates.
           <br/>
           • So before reduction the carbonate ore must be converted into metal oxide by the process of calcination.
           <br/>
           • Calcination is the process in which a carbonate ore is heated strongly in the absence of air to convert it into metal oxide.
           <br/>
           For example,
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Class 10 Science Question Paper 2018 (Delhi &amp; Outside Delhi) with Solutions Img 16" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-164715" height="68" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CBSE-Class-10-Science-Question-Paper-2018-Delhi-Outside-Delhi-with-Solutions-Img-16-2.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CBSE-Class-10-Science-Question-Paper-2018-Delhi-Outside-Delhi-with-Solutions-Img-16-2.png 464w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CBSE-Class-10-Science-Question-Paper-2018-Delhi-Outside-Delhi-with-Solutions-Img-16-2-300x44.png 300w" width="464"/>
           <br/>
           • The metal oxide obtained by calcination is converted to free metal by using reducing agents like carbon, aluminium, sodium or calcium. The reducing agent used depends on the chemical reactivity of the metal to be extracted.
           <br/>
           For example,
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Class 10 Science Question Paper 2018 (Delhi &amp; Outside Delhi) with Solutions Img 17" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-164563" height="43" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CBSE-Class-10-Science-Question-Paper-2018-Delhi-Outside-Delhi-with-Solutions-Img-17-1.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CBSE-Class-10-Science-Question-Paper-2018-Delhi-Outside-Delhi-with-Solutions-Img-17-1.png 324w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CBSE-Class-10-Science-Question-Paper-2018-Delhi-Outside-Delhi-with-Solutions-Img-17-1-300x40.png 300w" width="324"/>
          </p>
          <p>
           Iron metal is extracted from its oxides by reduction with carbon. Tin and lead metals are also extracted by the reduction of their oxides with carbon.
           <br/>
           The metals prepared by the reduction process usually contain some impurities and obtaining pure metals from impure metals is called refining of metals and most of the metals are refined by electrolytic refining.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Copper can be extracted by heating its sulphide ore in the presence of excess of air. This process is called roasting.
           <br/>
           Steps in the roasting of copper:
           <br/>
           (i) The concentrated copper (I) sulphide ore is heated in air till a part of copper (I) sulphide is oxidised to copper (I) oxide.
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Class 10 Science Question Paper 2018 (Delhi &amp; Outside Delhi) with Solutions Img 18" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-164716" height="58" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CBSE-Class-10-Science-Question-Paper-2018-Delhi-Outside-Delhi-with-Solutions-Img-18-2.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CBSE-Class-10-Science-Question-Paper-2018-Delhi-Outside-Delhi-with-Solutions-Img-18-2.png 560w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CBSE-Class-10-Science-Question-Paper-2018-Delhi-Outside-Delhi-with-Solutions-Img-18-2-300x31.png 300w" width="560"/>
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) When a good amount of copper (I) sulphide has been converted into copper (I) oxide, then the supply of air for roasting is stopped. In the absence of air, copper (I) oxide reacts with the remaining copper (I) sulphide to form copper metal and sulphur dioxide.
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Class 10 Science Question Paper 2018 (Delhi &amp; Outside Delhi) with Solutions Img 19" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-164565" height="49" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CBSE-Class-10-Science-Question-Paper-2018-Delhi-Outside-Delhi-with-Solutions-Img-19-1.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CBSE-Class-10-Science-Question-Paper-2018-Delhi-Outside-Delhi-with-Solutions-Img-19-1.png 473w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CBSE-Class-10-Science-Question-Paper-2018-Delhi-Outside-Delhi-with-Solutions-Img-19-1-300x31.png 300w" width="473"/>
           <br/>
           (iii) The obtained metal is then purified by electrolytic refining.

          <p>
           (b) Lungs → Pulmonary Vein → Left Atrium → Left Ventricle → Aorta → Body organs . The oxygenated blood leaves the lungs through the pulmonary veins which return it to the left heart, completing the pulmonary cycle. This blood then enters the left atrium, which pumps it through the valve into the left ventricle. Left ventricle pumps oxygenated blood to different parts of the body through aorta.
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) The valves present in between atria and ventricles prevent the backflow of blood into atria when the ventricles contract to pump blood out of the heart to the rest of the body, as when the ventricles contract the valves close automatically so that the blood may not, go back into atria.

           Question 19.
           <br/>
           (a) Write the function of following parts in human female reproductive system:
           <br/>
           (i) Ovary
           <br/>
           (ii) Oviduct
           <br/>
           (iii) Uterus
           <br/>
           (b) Describe in brief the structure and function of placenta.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) (i) Ovary. Ovaries produce mature female sex cells called ‘ova’ or ‘eggs’ and also secrete certain female sex hormones.
           <br/>
           (ii) Oviduct. The ovum released by an ovary goes into the oviduct and the fertilisation of ovum by a sperm takes place in the oviduct.
           <br/>
           (iii) Uterus. The growth and development of a fertilised ovum into a baby takes place in the uterus.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Structure. After implantation, a disc like special tissue develops between the uterus wall and the embryo called placenta. It is the connecting link between the mother’s body and the baby. It contains blood spaces on the mother’s side and thousands of villi on the foetal side.
          </p>
          <p>
           Functions:
           <br/>
           (i) It provides a large surface area required for the exchange of nutrients, oxygen and waste products between the embryo and the mother.
           <br/>
           (ii) It also removes the metabolic waste from the embryo.

           Question 20.
           <br/>
           (a) A student is unable to see clearly the words written on the black board placed at a distance of approximately 3 m from him. Name the defect of vision the boy is suffering from. State the possible causes of this defect and explain the method of correcting it.
           <br/>
           (b) Why do stars twinkle? Explain.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           (a) Write the function of each of the following parts of human eye:
           <br/>
           (i) Cornea
           <br/>
           (ii) Iris
           <br/>
           (iii) Crystalline lens
           <br/>
           (iv) Ciliary muscles
           <br/>
           (b) What do you mean by power of accommodation of human eye lens? Write the values of near point and far point of a normal adult’s human eye.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The boy is suffering from nearsightedness or Myopia in which a person cannot see the distant objects clearly though he can see the nearby objects clearly.
          </p>
          <p>
           Myopia is caused –
           <br/>
           • due to high converging power of eye-lens (because of its short focal length); and
           <br/>
           • due to elongation of the eyeball.
           <br/>
           This defect can be corrected by placing a concave lens in front of the eye. Using a concave lens of suitable focal length in the spectacles of such a person can correct this defect.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) The stars appear very-very small, so stars can be considered to be point sources of light as they are far away from the earth. The continuously changing atmosphere is able to cause variations in the light coming from a point-sized star due to atmospheric refraction because of which the star appears to be twinkling.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           (a) (i) Cornea. The front part of the eye is called cornea. It is made of a transparent substance which is convex in shape. The light coming from objects enters the eye through the cornea.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Iris. Iris is a flat, coloured, ring shaped muscle behind the cornea of the eye. There is a hole in the middle of the iris called pupil. The iris controls the amount of light entering the eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Crystalline lens. The eye-lens forms a real image of the objects on the retina of the eye and light sensitive cells on the retina generate electrical signals which are sent to the brain through the optic nerve and give rise to the sensation of vision.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) Ciliary muscles. The eye-lens is held in position by suspensory ligaments and ciliary muscles. Ciliary muscles change the thickness of eye-lens while focussing. In other words, the focal length of eye-lens can be changed by changing its shape by the action of ciliary muscles.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) The ability of an eye to focus the distant objects as well as the nearby objects on the retina by changing the focai length or converging power of its lens is called power of accommodation.
           <br/>
           A normal eye has a power of accommodation which enables objects as far as infinity and as close as 25 cm to be focussed on the retina.
           <br/>
           Near Point = 30 cm; Far point = Infinity

           (b) Draw the magnetic field lines around a current carrying straight conductor.
           <br/>
           (c) What type of magnetic field is observed inside of such type of solenoid?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Fleming’s left hand rule. According to Fleming’s left-hand rule, hold the forefinger, the centre finger and the thumb of your left hand at right angles to one another. Adjust your hand in such a way that the forefinger points in the direction of magnetic field and the centre finger points in the direction of current. Then the direction in which the thumb points, gives the direction of force acting on the conductor.

           <br/>
           (b) (i) Strength of the magnetic field produced by a straight current carrying wire at a point is inversely proportional to the distance of that point from the wire.
           <br/>
           (ii) Strength of the magnetic field is directly proportional to the current passing in the wire.
           <br/>

           <br/>
           A student added few pieces of aluminium metal to two test tubes A and B containing aqueous solutions of iron sulphate and copper sulphate. In the second part of her experiment, she added iron metal to another test tubes C and D containing aqueous solutions of aluminium sulphate and copper sulphate.
           <br/>
           In which test tube or test tubes will she observe colour change? On the basis of this experiment, state which one is the most reactive metal and why?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Class 10 Science Question Paper 2018 (Delhi &amp; Outside Delhi) with Solutions Img 26" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-164721" height="136" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CBSE-Class-10-Science-Question-Paper-2018-Delhi-Outside-Delhi-with-Solutions-Img-26-1.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CBSE-Class-10-Science-Question-Paper-2018-Delhi-Outside-Delhi-with-Solutions-Img-26-1.png 357w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CBSE-Class-10-Science-Question-Paper-2018-Delhi-Outside-Delhi-with-Solutions-Img-26-1-300x114.png 300w" width="357"/>
          </p>
          <p>
           In test tubes A, B and D, the change in colour takes place.
           <br/>
           It means Al displaces Fe from (aq) iron sulphate and A1 also displaces copper from CuSO
           <sub>
            4
           </sub>
           solution. This shows that Alis more reactive that Fe and Cu.
           <br/>
           In the second experiment – Fe being less reactive than aluminium, does not displace Al from aluminium sulphate solution but displaces Cu from CuSO
           <sub>
            4
           </sub>
           solution. Thus ‘Al’ is the most reactive metal.

           <br/>
           When a solution of sodium sulphate is added to a solution of barium chloride, then a white precipitate of barium sulphate is formed along with sodium chloride solution. Hence, this reaction is precipitation reaction.

           Question 26.
           <br/>
           An object of height 4.0 cm is placed at a distance of 30 cm from the optical centre ‘O’ of a convex lens of focal length 20 cm. Draw a ray diagram to find the position and size of the image formed. Mark optical centre ‘O’ and principal focus ‘F’ on the diagram. Also find the approximate ratio of size of the image to the size of the object.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Given h
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           = +4 cm;
           <br/>
           u = -30 cm;
           <br/>
           f +20 cm
           <br/>

           <br/>
           Using lens formula,
           <br/>
           \(\frac { 1 }{ f }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ v }\) – \(\frac { 1 }{ u }\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ \(\frac { 1 }{ 20 }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ v }\) – \(\frac { 1 }{ -30 }\)
           <br/>
           \(\frac { 1 }{ v }\) – \(\frac { 1 }{ 20 }\) – \(\frac { 1 }{ 30 }\) = \(\frac { 3-2 }{ 60 }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ 60 }\)
           <br/>
           v = +60 cm
           <br/>
           Now, \(\frac{h_2}{h_1}\) = \(\frac{v}{u}\) = \(\frac{60}{-30}\) = -2
           <br/>
           ⇒ \(\frac{h_2}{h_1}\) = \(\frac{2}{1}\) or h
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           : h
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           = 2 : 1
           <br/>
           ∴ Ratio of size of image to size of object is 2 : 1.
