           Question 20.
           <br/>
           A ray of light starting from air passes through medium A of refractive index 1.50, enters medium B of refractive index 1.33 and finally enters medium C of refractive index 2.42. If this ray emerges out in air from C, then for which of the following pairs of media the bending of light is least?
           <br/>
           (a) air-A
           <br/>
           (b) A-B
           <br/>
           (c) B-C
           <br/>
           (d) C-air

           Question 21.
           <br/>
           Which of the following statements is not true for scattering of light?
           <br/>
           (a) Colour of the scattered light depends on the size of particles of the atmosphere.
           <br/>
           (b) Red light is least scattered in the atmosphere.
           <br/>
           (c) Scattering of light takes place as various colours of white light travel with different speed in air.
           <br/>
           (d) The fine particles in the atmospheric air scatter the blue light more strongly than red. So the scattered blue light enters our eyes.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (c) Scattering of light takes place as various colours of white light travel with different speed in air.

           Question 43.
           <br/>
           A converging lens forms a three times magnified image of an object, which can be taken on a screen. If the focal length of the lens is 30 cm, then the distance of the object from the lens is
           <br/>
           (a) – 55 cm
           <br/>
           (b) – 50 cm
           <br/>
           (c) – 45 cm
           <br/>
           (d) – 40 cm
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (d) -40 cm
           <br/>
           Given. f = 30 cm and m = -3
           <br/>
           As we know; m = \(\frac { v }{ u }\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ -3 = \(\frac { v }{ u }\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ v = -3u …(ii)
           <br/>
           Also, \(\frac { 1 }{ 1 }\) – \(\frac { 1 }{ u }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ f }\)
           <br/>
           \(\frac { 1 }{ -3u }\) – \(\frac { 1 }{ u }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ 30 }\) … [From (i)
           <br/>
           ⇒ 3u = – 4 × 30
           <br/>
           ⇒ u = \(\frac { -120 }{ 3 }\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ -40 cm
           <br/>
           So, object is placed at a distance of -40 cm from the lens.

           An object of height 4 cm is kept at a distance of 30 cm from the pole of a diverging mirror. If the focal length of the mirror is 10 cm, the height of the image formed is

           The figure shown below represents a common type of dialysis called as Haemodialysis. It removes waste products from the blood. Such as excess salts, and urea which are insufficiently removed by the kidney in patients with kidney failure. During the procedure, the patient’s blood is cleaned by filtration through a series of semi-permeable membranes before being returned to the blood of the patient.

           \(\frac { -1 }{ u }\) = \(\frac { 5 }{ 80 }\)

           The object is placed at 16 cm in front of the eye piece lens.
