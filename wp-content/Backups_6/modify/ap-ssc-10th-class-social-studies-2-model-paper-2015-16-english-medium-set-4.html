           <strong>
            A.

           1) There is a system in our country to provide free legal service to the people.
           <br/>
           2) Under the legal services Authority (amendment) Act – 2002, legal services
           <br/>
           authorities are constituted to provide free and legal services to the weaker sections of the society.
           <br/>
           3) This is to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen by reasons of economic or other disabilites and to organise Lok Adalats to ensure that the operation of the legal system promotes justice on eqtial opportunity basis.
           <br/>

           <br/>
           <strong>
            A. Justification:
           </strong>
           <br/>
           1) Because of great power r valry during the Cold War Era. Many economic projects were set up in developing countries as part of the rivalry but suffered as a result of the quest for influence.
           <br/>
           2) During the years the focus of NAM Summits therefore shifted away from essentially political issues, to the advocacy of solutions to global economic and other problems.
           <br/>
           3) During the 1970s and early 1980s, the NAM also sponsored campaigns for restructuring commercial relations between developed and developing nations, namely the NIEO.
           <br/>
           4) The Jakarta Summit 1992 allowed the movement to shift its focus in a direction that also enabled it to work across to grouping such as the G-7 and the EU.

           2) It held racial theories based upon the belief of the existence of an Aryan master race that was believed to be superior to all other races especially Jews as they were mixed race.
           <br/>
           3) Nazi Germany began its own programme of expansion, seeking to restore the ‘rightful’ boundaries of historic Germany.
           <br/>
           4) Hitler’s economic policies showed an improvement of living standards of a section of the Germans even though it meant sub-human conditions of life for those condemned by the racist regime.

           5) This was followed by heavy investment in armament industry to create further employment but this could be sustained only by going on war with the neighbours. These were the ideologies and economic policies of Hitler that led to the Second World War.

           1) Aggressive and narrow nationalism was one of the causes for world wars.
           <br/>
           2) Nationalism was a positive impulse and the force behind unification of Italy and Germany.
           <br/>
           3) If nationalism was aggressive, it could create pride in oneself and hatred against neighbours.
           <br/>
           4) There existed a deep-seated antagonism between Germany and Russia ; Germany and France; till First World War.
           <br/>
           5) Italian Fascism from 1923 and National Socialism of German Nazis were other forms of aggressive nationalism in destructive mode.
           <br/>
           6) They built images of ruling over the world and mobilised their people against other nations.
           <br/>
           7) They took a death blow in the Second World War.
           <br/>
