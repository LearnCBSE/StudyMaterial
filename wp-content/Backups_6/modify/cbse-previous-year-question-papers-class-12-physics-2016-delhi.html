           Question 2.
           <br/>
           How does the electric flux due to a point charge enclosed by a spherical Gaussian surface get affected when its radius is increased ? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           According to Gauss’s law
           <br/>
           \(\phi=\int \overrightarrow{\mathrm{E}} \cdot \overrightarrow{d s}=\frac{q_{e n}}{\varepsilon_{0}}\)
          </p>
          <p>
           Flux depends only on the charge enclosed and not on the radius. Hence, the electric flux remains constant.

           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Why are microwaves considered suitable for radar systems used in aircraft navigation ? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Microwaves are considered suitable because they have a short wavelength range they are suitable for radar system used in aircraft navigation.

           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Define ‘quality factor’ of resonance in series LCR circuit. What is its SI unit ? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Q factor of series resonance circuit is defined as the ratio of the voltage developed across the inductor or capacitor at resonance to the impressed voltage, which is the voltage across R.
           <br/>
           \(Q=\frac{1}{R} \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}\)
           <br/>
           It is dimensionless quantity. Hence, it has no units.

           (ii) Demodulation used in Communication System. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Attenuation : The loss of strength of a signal while propagating through a medium is known as attenuation.
           <br/>
           (ii) Demodulation : The process of retrieval of information from the carrier wave at the receiver end is termed as demodulation. This is the reverse process of modulation.

           Question 7.
           <br/>
           Plot a graph showing variation of de-Broglie wavelength λ versus 1/√v, where V is accelerating potential for two particles A and B carrying same charge but of masses m

           ). Which one of the two represents a particle of smaller mass and why ? [2]

           <br/>
           We know that,
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 Physics 2016 Delhi 5" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-127080" height="288" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Physics-2016-Delhi-5.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Physics-2016-Delhi-5.png 365w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Physics-2016-Delhi-5-300x237.png 300w" width="365"/>
           <br/>
           Hence, the particle with lower mass (m
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           ) will have greater slope.

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           State Brewster’s law.
           <br/>
           The value of Brewster angle for a transparent medium is different for light of different colors. Give reason. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Brewster’s law: The law states that the tangent of the polarizing angle of incidence for a given medium is equal to the refractive index of the medium. The light incident at this angle when reflects back is perfectly polarized,
           <br/>
           i.e.  μ = tan i
           <sub>
            p
           </sub>
           <br/>
           The refractive index of a material depends on the color or wavelength of light. As the polarizing angle depends on refractive index (p = tan i
           <sub>
            p
           </sub>
           ), so it also depends on wavelength of light.

           Question 11.
           <br/>
           A charge is distributed uniformly over a ring of radius ‘a’. Obtain an expression for the electric intensity E at a point on the axis of the ring. Hence show that for points at large distances from the ring, it behaves like a point charge. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Suppose we have a ring of radius a that carries a uniformly distributed positive charge q.

           The electric field dE has two components.
           <br/>
           (i) The axial components dE cos θ and
           <br/>
           (ii) The perpendicular component dE sin θ.
           <br/>
           Since the perpendicular component of any two diametrically opposite elements are equal and opposite, they cancel out in pairs. Only the axial components will add up to produce the resultant field.

           Question 14.
           <br/>
           (a) Define mutual inductance.
           <br/>
           (b) A pair of adjacent coils has a mutual inductance of 1.5 H. If the current in one coil changes from 0 to 20 A in 0.5 s, what is the change of flux linkage with the other coil ? [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Mutual induction is the phenomenon of production of induced emf in one coil due to change of current or flux in the neighboring coil. The coil in which the current changes is called primary coil and the coil in which emf is induced is called the secondary coil.

           Answer :
           <br/>
           (a) Quantization condition : Of all possible circular orbits allowed by the classical theory, the electrons are permitted to circulate only in those orbits in which the angular momentum of an electron is an integral multiple of h/2π ; h being planck constant.
           <br/>
           therefore, for any permitted  orbit,
           <br/>
           \(\mathrm{L}=m v r=\frac{n h}{2 \pi} ; n=1,2,3, \ldots \ldots\)
          </p>

           Where L, m, and v are the angular momentum, mass and speed of the electron respectively, r is the radius of the permitted orbit and n is positive integer called principle quantum number.
          </p>
          <p>
           The above equation is Bohr’s famous quantum condition. When an electron of mass m is confined to move in a line of length l with velocity v, the de-Broglie wavelength λ , associated with electron is:

           Question 22.
           <br/>
           Draw a schematic ray diagram of reflecting telescope showing how rays coming from a distant object are received at the eye-piece. Write its two important advantages over a refracting telescope. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           Reflecting Telescope : The reflecting telescope make use of a concave mirror as objective. The rays of light coming from distant object are incident on the objective (parabolic reflector). After reflection the rays of light meet at a point where another convex mirror is placed. This mirror focuses light inside the telescope tube. The final image is seen through the eye¬piece. The images produced by the reflecting telescope is very bright and its resolving power is high.

           <br/>
           Advantages:
           <br/>
           (i) The resolving power (the ability to observe two object distinctly) is high, due to the large diameter of the objective.
           <br/>
           (ii) There is no chromatic aberration as the object is a mirror.

           (a) A transformer is an electrical device for converting an alternating current at low voltage into high voltage or vice-versa.
           <br/>
           1. If it increases the input a.c. voltage and decreases the, it is called step up transformer.
           <br/>
           2. If it decreases the input a.c. voltage and increases the current, it is called step down transformer.
           <br/>
           Principle : It works on the principle of mutual induction i.e., when a changing current or flux is passed through one of the two inductively coupled coils, an induced emf is set up in the other coil.
           <br/>

           <br/>
           Working Theory : As the a.c. flows through the primary, it generate an alternating magnetic flux in the core which passes through the secondary coil
          </p>
          <p>
           Let N
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           = No. of turns in primary coils

            2
           </sub>

           <br/>
           This changing flux set up an induced emf in the secondary, also a self induced emf in the primary.
          </p>
          <p>
           If there is no leakage of magnetic flux, then flux linked with each turn of the primary will be equal to that linked with each of the secondary. According to Faraday’s law of induction
          </p>
          <p>
           Induced emf in the primary coil, \(\varepsilon_{1}=-N_{1} \frac{d \phi}{d t}\)
           <br/>
           Induced emf in the secondary coil, \(\mathrm{e}_{2}=-\mathrm{N}_{2} \frac{d \phi}{d t}\)
           <br/>
           Where, \(\frac{d \phi}{d t}=\) = Rate of change of magnetic flux associated with each turn.
           <br/>
           Φ = Magnetic flux linked with each turn of the primary or secondary at any instant.

          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Copper loss : Some energy is lost due to the heating of copper wires used in the primary and secondary winding’s. This power loss (P = I
            <sup>
             2
            </sup>
            R) can be minimized by using thick copper wires of low resistance.
           </li>
           <li>
            Eddy current loss or Iron loss: The alternating , magnetic flux induces eddy current in their on core which leads to some energy loss in the form of heat. This loss can be reduced by using laminated iron core.
           </li>
           <li>
            Hysteresis loss : When the iron core is subjected to a cycle of magnetization the core gets heated up due to hysteresis, having low hysteresis loop.
           </li>
           <li>
            Flux leakage : The magnetic flux produced by the primary may not fully pass through the secondary. Some of the flux may leak into air. This loss can be minimized by winding the primary and secondary coils over one another.

           Dispersion. of light : Dispersion is often observed as light passes through a triangular prism. Upon passing through the prism, the white light is separated into its component colours : red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and voilet. The separation of visible light into its different colours is known as dispersion. Dispersion occurs because for different colour of light a transparent medium will have different refractive indices (μ). as different colours have different speed in transparent medium
