           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the following passage.
          </p>
          <p>
           (A) Miniature painting is a traditional style of art that is very detailed, often referred to as painting or working “in miniature”. Because of their origins as illuminations, they are also painted to have as smooth of a surface as possible. Indian miniature paintings have always piqued global interest. Indian miniatures were profoundly influenced by Indian Mythological Literature and were executed as illustrations to texts or as individual paintings. They were small-scale highly detailed pictorial compositions, often providing a true record of the social and cultural life of the time.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           (B) This time, Delhi’s National Museum has lent 101 such paintings from its collection to the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra, for a month long exhibition. “Ram Katha”, the collection, chronologically captures the story of the Ramayana. “Ram Katha” is the narrative of Lord Ram, who is the 17th incarnation of Lord Vishnu’s 24 incarnations.
          </p>
          <p>
           (C) The paintings done between the 17th and 19th centuries by artists from various schools of art in India, are themed on Lord Ram’s life. “The Ramayana, composed by Valmiki in Sanskrit is believed to be the first known narrative of Indian literature. The paintings based on Ram Katha come from north, central and the east of India,” says Vijay Kumar Mathur, the curator of the exhibition. It took him four months to curate the display from the museum’s collection of 500 odd miniature paintings depicting the Ramayana.
          </p>
          <p>
           (D) The exhibits represent a matured movement in miniature art wherein the spirit of Ramayana has been researched upon and visualised in colours. “While this will be a treat for Indian spectators in Australia, it will also be a special way to introduce Indian culture among the Australian citizens” says Mathur. Starting on May 22, the exhibition will kick off the Festival of India in Australia. All major styles of Pahari paintings (Basholi, Chamba, Kangra and Bilaspur) are on display, while Rajasthani styles include Mewar, Bundi, Jaipur, Bikaner and Deogarh.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           (E) There are representations from central Indian styles of Malwa, Orchha, Datia and Rahogarh, besides specimens of Mughal style from Bundelkhand, Deccani and Bijapur and classical folk styles of Kalighat are also on display. Most of these styles originated between the 15th and 19th centuries. Some of the noteworthy works include The Portrait of Ram (Basholi style, Pahari, 1730); Ram breaks Shiva’s bow in the court of King Janak (Provincial Mughal style, Orchha, Bundelkhand, early 17th century); Wedding of Ram and Sita (Mandi style, mid 18th century); Ram, Lakshman and the golden deer (Kalighat style, Bengal, late 19th century); and Hanuman with Dronagiri mountain (Rahogarh style, Central India, late 18th century).
          </p>
          <p>
           (F) The “Ram Katha” exhibition was first held at the National Museum in 2013. The same year it travelled to the Royal Museum of Art and History in Brussels, where it was on display for six months.
          </p>
          <p>

           The “Ram Katha” exhibition was first held at the National Museum in 2013. The same year it travelled to the Royal Museum of Art and History in Brussels, where it was on display for six months.
          </p>
          <p>
           (viii) Complete the following appropriately.
          </p>
          <p>
           Based on the use of the word “piqued” to describe the Indian miniature paintings, in paragraph 1, we can infer that Indian miniature paintings have always __________ global interest.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Aroused.
          </p>
          <p>
           The meaning of pique is to ‘arouse’. Indian miniature paintings have always aroused global interest.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Read the following passage.
          </p>
          <p>
           (A) The Amazon rainforest is the world’s largest tropical rainforest. It covers an area of almost 2.8 million square miles, which is nearly the size of the continent of Australia. The Amazon rainforest gets its life from the majestic Amazon river, the world’s second largest river, which runs directly through the heart of the region. The rainforest itself is simply the drainage basin for the river and its many tributaries. The vast forest consists of four layers, each featuring its own ecosystem and specially adapted plants and animals. The lush region provides important benefits to communities living near and far. Nearly 500 indigenous communities call the Amazon rainforest home. It’s a highly biodiverse ecosystem, home to untold species of plants and animals. The rainforest can create its own weather and influence climates around the world.
          </p>
          <p>
           (B) It is one of the most diverse ecosystem in the world, home to 10 per cent of the world’s species, according to the World Wildlife Fund. There are more than 2.5 million species of insect that scuttle through the leaf litter. It contains roughly 1,300 bird species, 3,000 species of fish and approximately 430 species of mammals, according to National Geographic.
          </p>
          <p>
           (C) These animals play an important role in keeping the rainforest healthy. For instance, important nutrients from the carcasses, feces and food scraps deposited by mammals leech into the forest floor. This nutrient influx helps soil microbes better store carbon instead of releasing it into the atmosphere.
          </p>
          <p>
           (D) More than 40,000 plant species have been found in the Amazon rainforest. Many of them have important medicinal uses or are found in the foods we eat. Chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon, pepper and coffee are grown in the rainforest. Rubber trees produce a sticky, white latex sap that holds our planet together and provides a source of income for indigenous communities living in the rainforest. Thus, the Amazon plants play an active role in regulating the ecosystem.
          </p>
          <p>
           (E) The forest floor is the lowest region. Since only two per cent of the sunlight filters through the top layers to the understory, very few plants grow here. The forest floor, however, is rich with rotting vegetation and the bodies of dead organisms, which are quickly broken down into nutrients and integrated into the soil. Tree roots stay close to these available nutrients and decomposers such as millipedes and earthworms use nutrients for food.
          </p>
          <p>
           (F) The understory is the layer above the forest floor. Much like the forest floor, only about 2-5 per cent of the sunlight reaches this shadowy realm. Many of the plants in the understory have large, broad leaves to collect as much sunlight as possible. The understory is so thick that there is very little air movement. As a result, plants rely on insects and animals to pollinate their flowers.
          </p>
          <p>
           (G) The layer above the understory is the canopy. This is where much of the action in the rainforest occurs. Many canopy leaves have specially adapted leaves which form “drip tips”. Drip tips allow water to flow off the leaves which prevents mosses, fungi, and lichens from occupying the leaves. Leaves in the canopy are very dense and filter about 80 per cent of the sunlight. The canopy is where the wealth of the rainforest, fruits and flowers grow. Bromeliads, cup-like plants, provide drinking pools for animals and breeding locations for tree frogs.
          </p>
          <p>
           (H) The Amazon rainforest plays an important part in regulating the world’s oxygen and carbon cycles. It produces roughly 6 per cent of the world’s oxygen and has long been thought to act as a carbon sink, meaning it readily absorbs large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
          </p>
          <p>
           Answer the following questions based on the above passage.
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) What is the Amazon rainforest also called? Support your answer with a reason.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Amazon rainforest is called the world’s largest rainforest because it covers an area of nearly 2.8 million square miles.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Why is there very little air movement in the understory?
           <br/>
           (A) It is the layer above the forest floor.
           <br/>
           (B) Very few plants grow here.
           <br/>
           (C) The understory is very thick and also covered with large, broad leaves.
           <br/>
           (D) Hardly 2.5 per cent of the sunlight reaches this shadowy realm.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (C) The understory is very thick and also covered with large, broad leaves.
          </p>
          <p>
           Explanation:
           <br/>
           The Amazon rainforest has plants with very thick leaves.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Why do very few plants grow in the understory of the rainforests?
           <br/>

           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Amazon rainforest plays an important part in regulating the world’s oxygen and carbon cycles. It produces roughly 6 per cent of the world’s oxygen and has long been thought to act as a carbon sink, meaning it readily absorbs large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

           Dear Rashi
          </p>
          <p>
           Hope you are feeling better now. It’s nearly 10 days you haven’t been to school. During these days, you missed a chance of inter-school drama competition, which took place in our school auditorium on 16th Feb. Nearly six top schools of Agra took part in it. E-lindi film actor Mr. Amol Palekar was the chief- guest from Mumbai. Three dramas in English and three dramas in Hindi were played altogether. Each school was given one drama to play. Our school had to act on Shakespeare play, “The Merchant of Venice”. I was lucky enough I got the role of Portia the main character. Suresh acted as Antonio, Rahul acted as Bassanio and the top negative character of Shylock was acted by Jeetu. Only the court scene was acted. Our English teacher, Mr. Ramnath Prabhakar, deserves all the credit for the success of the play. He worked nearly 6 – 8 hours every day to practice the scene along with dialogues with each one of us. We also went to sir’s house to practice in the evenings.
          </p>
          <p>
           My role of Portia was highly appreciated specially the dialogues on, “Mercy”. People applauded a lot. But the greatest news is that our school won the competition. I got the award for the best actress from Mr. Amol Palekar, a trophy and a certificate, which I will show you once you are back to school. I wish you were there at that very moment. Give my regards to uncle and aunty and love to Ananya. Waiting to see you in the school soon.
          </p>
          <p>
           Yours lovingly,

           Question 6.
           <br/>
           Write a short paragraph on ’If I were invisible’.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Every once in a while, we are surrounded by a thought that what if I was invisible. There are so many things one could do being invisible, it just depends on our creativity and thought process. But if I am ever blessed with the power of invisibility, I will use it positively. I can monitor crime being invisible no one would know I am there and, in this way, I could catch the criminals. I can visit forests without being afraid of the animals. I can help people by monitoring if the services at hospitals, NGOs, etc. are carried out properly. I can visit factories to see if they have appointed child labour or if their workers are working in a degraded environment and can get them reported. Being invisible will give me the power to see the world differently. Everything will seem transparent as I can witness it all. It would be great if an ability like this would be used in a positive way to abolish crime.

           You have recently moved to a new neighbourhood in your city. Describe the new neighbourhood comparing it to the one you have just left.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A good neighbour makes our life sweet whereas, a bad neighbour does not make our life very good. I have recently shifted to a new house in a new locality which seems to be far better than the previous one where we once lived. The new house is good with many facilities and has a wonderful and pleasant neighbourhood. Here, everybody is literate and everyone is working. We also have got a nice park and a gym nearby, which are the main attractions. There is a bank in the market, grocery shops, small restaurants and medical shops, which are very close by and approachable. Even transport facility is pretty good. There are buses that will take you to different parts of the city. The railway station is at a 10-minute walk from my house.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the earlier locality, we were not lucky enough to have a good neighbourhood. Early in the morning people used to quarrel among themselves. All the children were very naughty. They used to break the glass doors, windows and cars, they would spoil our garden by plucking leaves and flowers. In our new neighbourhood, we all live in peace and harmony. In case of any kind of emergency to any resident, we all come forward to help that person. I have many friends in my new neighbourhood and we all enjoy playing in the evenings. We celebrate every occasion and festival and this makes it lot more fun and enjoyment for all of us in the neighbourhood. All of us have a feeling of sharing our happiness and sorrows together. Nothing is personal in our lives. We are not just neighbours but we all have unitedly become a large family. In conclusion, I can say that the place where I live is calm and peaceful and it is a delight to live with happy neighbours.

           Question 8.
           <br/>
           Read the given excerpts and answer the questions briefly, for ANY TWO excerpts of the three given.
          </p>
          <p>
           (A) “And both that morning equally lay,
           <br/>
           In leaves no step had trodden black,
           <br/>
           Oh, I kept the first for another day!
           <br/>
           Yet knowing how way leads on to way
           <br/>
           I doubted if I should ever come back.”
          </p>
          <p>
           (a) Who does ‘both’ refer to?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           ‘Both’ refers to the two roads.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Why does the poet doubt his coming back?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The poet is aware that his choice will have consequences and may lead him down to a new path. Therefore he is uncertain about what lies ahead and whether he will be able to retrace his steps and return to this point in the future. These lines highlight the theme of decision-making and the idea that choices have consequences, as well as the uncertainty and doubt that can accompany making a choice.
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) Why would the poet like to come back?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The poet would like to come back to travel on the road not taken.
          </p>
          <p>
           (B) “Alone she cuts and binds the grain;
           <br/>
           And sings a melancholy strain;
           <br/>
           Listen for the vale profound
           <br/>
           Is overflowing with the sound.”
          </p>
          <p>
           (a) Who is ‘she’ in the above lines?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           ‘She’ in the above lines refers to the solitary reaper.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) What kind of a song is she singing?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           She is singing a sad and melancholic song.
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) What does the expression ‘vale profound’ mean? Explain.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The expression “vale profound” means a deep valley. The phrase is used to describe the sound of the young woman’s singing, which fills the entire valley with its melancholy tone. The speaker invites the reader to listen to her song, suggesting that it is powerful and moving. The use of this phrase emphasises how far reaching and significant her song is and it adds to the overall theme of solitude and the beauty of nature in the poem.
          </p>
          <p>
           (C) When I cry the hills laugh;
           <br/>
           When I humble myself the flowers rejoice;
           <br/>
           When I bow, all the things are elated.

           The intensity with which the rain falls. When raindrops cry, a visual impression is produced that makes it appear as though the hills are smiling; when the rain stops, the flowers seem to be savouring the moment. When rain gives way to the rainbow everyone seems to enjoy it.

           When the officers heard the booming and monotonous voice of the ‘Professor’ from the kitchen, they were scared that they would be caught by the Professor and would have to listen to his lecture. They ran away as they were afraid that the ‘Professor’ would start his lecture on his superior knowledge on how to run a cookhouse.

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Answer ANY ONE of the following two questions in about 120 words. 6 × 1 = 6
          </p>
          <p>
           (A) Discuss the significance of the title, ‘Best-Seller’. What role does this play in the life of John Pescud ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The story revolves around a best-seller called ‘The Rose Lady and Trevelyan’. The circumstances that led John to marry Jessie are almost similar to the story of the novel. It reveals how a reader is influenced by the bestsellers. John placed himself in the place of the protagonist Trevelyan and imagined what it would be to have a romantic love life like him. His own life was nothing but a romantic novel. He married Jessie, quite unknown to him who belonged to a family of belted earls, just as the hero of the novel got married to a princess.

           (B) Do you think Bill Bramble was cut out to be a professional boxer on all counts?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Bill Bramble’s character reveals that to be a professional boxer one need not be violent by nature, especially with the people in one’s private life. So as far as his profession was concerned, he was a tough boxer to fight with. This is evident from the admiration millions of people had for him, and from the way newspapers liked to cover his achievements. So his nature and his profession can be considered as absolutely contradictory to each other. But his ability to hit his fellow-man in the eye while apparently aiming an attack on his stomach, and vice versa, had won him laurels. Among the London’s teeming millions there was not a man, weighing eight stone four, whom he could not overcome in a twenty-round contest. Thus, in my opinion he was surely cut out to be a professional boxer on all counts.
