           <br/>
           â€˜Î²-galactosidase enzyme is considered a better selectable markerâ€™. Justify the statement.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Î²-galactosidase is a better selectable maker, as it allows the selection of differentiation between recombinants and non-recombinants on the basis of their ability to produce colour in the presence of a chromogenic substrate. Because the selection of recombinants due to inactivation of antibiotic resistant gene is a tedious and time taking process as latter involves growing the bacteria simultaneously on two antibiotics containing media.

           Is haemophilia in humans a sex-linked or autosomal disorder? Workout a cross in support of your answer.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) The maximum crossing over is seen in genes A and d, and a and D. Since, A and d, and a and D are located far away, from one another.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The strength of the linkage increases as the distance between two linked genes decreases. The linkage becomes weaker with the increase in the distance between genes.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Haemophilia is an X-linked recessive disease. The gene responsible for haemophilia is located on X-chromosome and because males have only single copy of X-chromosome with no alternate normal allele, they are always affected. While, in case of female, they can be carrier of the disease but being affected is a rare case.
           <br/>
           Suppose a carrier female and normal male marries . each other then the genotype of their offspring/children will be
           <br/>

           <br/>
           Hence, from the cross, it can be concluded that haemophilia is a X-linked recessive disorder in which the son inherit the disease from mother, while daughters from their father.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Part A shows the prostate gland and part 6 shows the Bulbourethral gland. Both prostate gland and Bulbourethral gland are male accessory gland. Secretion of these glands constitutes the seminal plasma which is rich in fructose, calcium and certain enzymes. The secretion of Bulbourethral gland also helps in the lubrication of penis.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Scrotum is situated outside the abdominal cavity as it is essential for spermatogenesis, i.e. formation of sperm which requires the temperature of about 2 â€“ 2.5Â°C lower than the internal body temperature.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The uses of plasmid DNA, recognition sequences and gel electrophoresis are as follows
           <br/>
           Plasmid DNA : It is used for constructing recombinant DNA by ligating the alien piece of DNA with it. It is used as cloning vector and helps in the selection of recombinants from non-recombinants.
          </p>
          <p>
           Recognition sequences : These are the specific base sequences of DNA where restriction enzyme cuts the DNA. These are utilised to extract the desired gene or fragments from DNA molecules.
          </p>
          <p>
           Gel electrophoresis : It is a techinque used to separate the DNA fragments according to their size through seiving effect of the gel.

           Question 24.
           <br/>
           Seed is the basis of our agriculture. Dehydration and dormancy of mature seeds are crucial for storage of seeds. It can be used as food throughout the year and also to raise crop in the next season.
           <br/>
           (i) Why does it is crucial for seed to undergo dormancy?
           <br/>
           (ii) Give an example of a very old viable seed which is excavated from Arctic Tundra, in which the seed germinated and flowered after an estimated record of 10,000 years of dormancy.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Dormancy is a condition in which the water content reduces, seed become dry, the metabolic activity of embryo slows down and the seed may enter into a state of inactivity. It is crucial for seed to undergo dormancy in order to escape unfavourable environment such as unsuitable temperature, unadequate water/ moisture, oxygen, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The oldest viable seed is that of a lupine, Lupinus ariticus, excavated from Arctic Tundra.
           <br/>
           In order to obtain maximum marks,1 following tips should be followed Points Car|didate should start his answer by defining the term dormancy and then its importance.

           Question 26.
           <br/>
           Double fertilisation is reported in plants of both, castor and groundnut. However, the mature seeds of groundnut are non-albuminous and castor are albuminous. Explain the post-fertilisation events that are responsible for it.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Double fertilisation is reported in both castor and groundnut, but their mature seeds are different in terms of endosperm. Endosperm may be completely utilised by the developing embryo before the maturation of seeds as in groundnut.
          </p>
          <p>
           Such seeds are called non-albuminous or non-endospermic seeds. In some seeds, a portion of endosperm remains in the seed and is used up during seed germination. Such seeds are called albuminous or endospermic seeds, e.g. castor.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 27.
           <br/>
           Population is a set of individuals of a particular species, which are found in a particular geographical area and can interbreed. Population ecology is an important area of ecology because it links ecology to population genetics and evolution.
           <br/>
           (i) Write the importance of measuring the size of a population in a habitat or an ecosystem.
           <br/>
           (ii) Explain with the help of an example, how the percentage cover is a more meaningful measure of population size than mere numbers.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Ecological competition is the struggle between two organisms for the same resources within an environment. Resources are components of the environment, they are required for survival and reproduction such as food, water, shelter, light, territory and substrate.
           <br/>
           (i) In which process, the fitness of one species (measured in terms of its V the intrinsic rate of increase) is significantly lower in the presence of another superior species?
           <br/>
           (ii) In which mechanism, species facing competition might evolve mechanism that promotes co-existence rather than exclusion?
           <br/>
           (iii) Level of competition between species depends on which factors?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Measurement of population in a habitat determines the relative abundance of a particular species and its effect on the available resources of that particular habitat.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The percentage cover is more meaningful measure of population size than mere numbers because the relative abundance of a species is not only determined by number of individuals, but by the relative abundance in both biomass and number.
          </p>
          <p>
           For example, in a unit area, the number of grass species or relative abundance in number is high, but not the relative biomass, if the same area has one or two Ficus benghalensis tree, it is very low in relative abundance, but high in relative abundance of biomass.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (i) Competition is best defined by the fitness of one species as compared to other competitive species. It is the process in which the fitness of one species is significantly lower in the presence of another superior competitior species.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Species facing competition might evolve mechanism that promotes co-existence rather than exclusion. One such mechanism is resource partitioning.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Level of competition between species depends on availability of resources, population density and group interaction of organism.
          </p>

           Question 28.
           <br/>
           A considerable amount of lactose is added to the growth medium of E. coli. How is the lac operon switched on in the bacteria? Mention the state of the operon when lactose is digested.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In lac operon, when lactose is added, it enters the cell wall with the help of permease, a small amount of which is already present in cell. Lactose binds itself to active repressor and changes its structure. The repressor now fails to bind to the operator.
          </p>
          <p>
           The RNA polymerase starts transcription of operon by binding to promoter site-R All the three enzymes for lactose metabolism are synthesised.
          </p>
          <p>
           After some time, when whole lactose is consumed, â€˜there is no inducer present to bind to the repressor. Due to this, the repressor becomes active again, attaches itself to the operator and finally switches off the operon.

           (ii) LH released by the pituitary gland become abnormally low at day 14 due to unknown reasons. Explain its impact on ovulation stating the reasons.
           <br/>
           (iii) If progesterone is absent or low in level, will menstruation occur? Justify your answer.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Oogenesis is the process of formation of a mature female gamete. The production of eggs in females begins before birth, i.e. during the embryonic development stage, but is completed only after fertilisation. It takes place in ovaries.
           <br/>
           The process undergoes following phases
          </p>
          <p>
           (a) Multiplication phase Cells of germinal epithelium undergo mitotic division producing undifferentiated germ cells called oogonia or egg mother cells within each foetal ovary. These cells start dividing and enter prophase-I of meiotic division and get temporarily arrested at this stage. These cells are known as primary oocytes.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Growth phase Each primary oocyte then gets surrounded by a single layer of granulosa cells and is called the primary follicle. About two million of these follicles exist in females before birth. A large number of these follicles degenerate during the phase from birth to puberty. Therefore, at puberty only 60,000-80,000 primary follicles are left in each ovary. The primary follicles get surrounded by more layers of granulosa cells and a new theca to form secondary follicles.
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) Maturation phase During this phase, the secondary follicle transforms into tertiary follicle. These are characterised by a fluid cavity called antrum. The theca layer is organised into an inner theca interna and an outer theca externa.
          </p>
          <p>
           The primary oocyte within this tertiary follicle grows in size. The fully grown primary oocyte completes its first meiotic division producing two daughter nuclei in which larger haploid cell is called secondary oocyte (ovum) and the tiny one is called first polar body. The secondary oocyte retains bulk of the nutrient rich cytoplasm of primary oocyte.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) If the secondary oocyte is not fertilised, it passes into the uterus as an immature egg and the lining of the uterus, i.e. endometrium is shed during menstruation.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (i) After fertilisation of ovum with sperm, the zygote is formed. The fertilised eggs stay in the Fallopian tube for about 3 to 4 days. But within 24 days, it starts to divide and move towards the uterus for implantation. As a result of change in different hormone levels and need of thick endometrium for zygote to implant, menstrual cycle stops till the birth of the baby.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) If LH released by the pituitary gland become low, the ovulation will not occur. As the leutinizing hormone surge, induces the rupture of Graafian follicle and thereby the release of ovum.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) As progesterone prepares endometrium for pregnancy its absence or low level leads to heavy menstrual bleeding, the uterus will not be able to implant the foetus. Due to this miscarriages can happen. Thus, this female will not be able to concieve a child.
          </p>

           (i) By studying the above graph discuss the efficiency of crude biosynthesised human insulin at low concentration, i. e. 50 Î¼g/mL.
           <br/>
           (ii) At which concentration, both the insulin are equally efficient.
           <br/>
           (iii) Using the above information, suggest why we should always use control in assay?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Advantages of using gene therapy for treating disorders are as follows
           <br/>
           (a) Sustained, local delivery with regulated gene expression.
           <br/>
           (b) It is less expensive as one gene can give rise to large number of protein molecules.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The disorder is caused due to the deletion of the gene for adenosine deaminase. In gene therapy, lymphocytes from the blood of the patient are grown in culture outside the body. A functional ADA cDNA (using a retroviral vector) is then introduced into these lymphocytes which are subsequently returned to the patient.
          </p>
          <p>
           As these cells are short lived, the patient requires periodic infusion of such genetically engineered â€¢ lymphocytes.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) If the functional ADA gene is isolated from bone marrow and is introduced at early embryonic stages, the deficiency could be permanently cured.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (i) The efficiency of crude biosynthesised human insulin is better than standard one. As we can see the cell (HepG2), viability is more in hyperglycemia condition in the crude biosynthesised insulin case.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) At high (150 Âµg/mL), both the insulin are equally efficient as in both the cases HepG2 cells are equally viable.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Control is necessary while performing assay as it helps to check the effects of insulin at different concentration.
          </p>

           Question 33.
           <br/>
           State the modifications of forelimb in animals as an example of homology.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Write the characteristics of Ramapithecus, Dryopithecus, Neanderthal man, Australopithecus, Homo habilis.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The forelimb of vertebrates are pentadactyl, i.e. consist of same bones humerus, radius, ulna, carpals, metacarpals and phalanges, but differ in their function in different organisms.
          </p>
          <p>
           The forelimbs of the following animals get modified as shown below
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Whale are modified for swimming.
           </li>
           <li>
            Bat and birds are modified for flying.
           </li>
           <li>
            Horse are modified for running.
           </li>
           <li>
            Frog are modified for leaping.
           </li>
           <li>
            Man are modified for grasping.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           This indicates common ancestry and homology based on divergent evolution.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           The characteristics are as follows
