             Advanced countries are making use of powerful electromagnets to move trains at very high speed. These trains are called maglev trains (abbreviated from magnetic levitation). These trains float on a guide way and do not run on steel tail tracks. Instead of using an engine based on fossil fuels, they make use of magnetic field forces. The magnetized coils are arranged in the guideway which repel the strong magnets placed in the trains’s under carriage. This helps train move over the guideway, a technic called electro dynamic suspension. When current passes in the coils of guideway, a typical magnetic field is set up between the undercarriage of train and guideway which pushes and pulls the train along the guideway depending on the requirement.The lack of friction and its aerodynamic style allows the train to move at very high speed.

           .Since the electron moves undeflected between the plates of condenser, there should be equal and opposite magnetic and electric forces upon it. Electric force is to the left, due to positively charged plate. Magnetic force on electron should be towards right. The magnetic field should therefore be directed perpendicular to plane of paper inwards, according to Fleming’s left hand rule.Magnetic force = Electrical force

           AB and CD are parallel wires. When they carry currents in same direction there will be attraction between them. When currents in them are in opposite directions, there will be repulsion between them. When AB is slightly depressed, force of repulsion will push it upwards and AB may vibrate. If force of attraction exists, CD will attract AB and vibration of AB will not be possible. Consequently AB and CD carry currents in opposite directions.

            Ans.
           </strong>
           A neutron is electrically a neutarl particle. It goes along path C, without any deviation.According to Fleming’s left hand rule, the force on negatively charged electron will be towards right. It will follow track D. Proton and alpha particles are positively charged particles. Magnetic force on these particles will be towards left. Centripetal force = magnetic force.
