           1. Read the passage given below: [8]
           <br/>
           1. Very often, we do not take the first step towards a good cause because we say to ourselves, “The task is so big. What can I do alone?” So nothings gets alone. There is much talk about environmental protection, air pollution and saving our forests. Do we really care? If we do, here are a few things we can do to make our surroundings more pleasant.
          </p>
          <p>
           2. It is good to adopt a two-uses-attitude! By putting an article to a second use, we are giving it a longer lease of life and using up less raw material from nature. One of the worst things we do is’-the abuse of paper. The clean sides of envelopes can be used to write small notes, lists and reminders around the house. The more paper we use, the more trees will have to be cut down. For the same reason, we should avoid the use of paper napkins or paper plates. Cloth napkins are just as good, for they can be washed and used over and over again.
          </p>
          <p>
           3. The one area which needs the most urgent attention is effective garbage disposal. People who are conscious about it follow rules and laws strictly. As a result, their neighbourhoods are clean and beautiful. A lot of people don’t care about the environment because they don’t understand the adverse effect that society has on it. It is important to convince people to care about the environment. The first step would be to convince people to change by providing simple alternative solutions and ways of doing things. The Internet is a powerful tool and a group of like-minded people c.an be formed on social media. People can share environmental stories and issues as well as pool in solutions and alternatives to educate one another. With the current state that our planet is in, it is imperative that people actively care about the environment and most importantly, act now.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           4. Similarly, each one of us can contribute to a cleaner environment. All kitchen waste should be collected separately. Those who have green fingers can turn this into valuable manure. Dig a pit and put the kitchen waste into it. When the pit is a little over half full, cover it up with mud. Let nature do the rest. Within three or six months, we will have a good garden manure. It can also be done as a community project by digging a large pit in the colony. Do take help of all the members, for nothing succeeds like co-operation.
           <br/>
           Based on your understanding of the passage, answer any %ight questions from the nine given below: [8 × 1 = 8]
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) Why don’t we take the first step towards a good cause?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           We don’t take the first step towards a good cause because we feel the task is too big and doubt our capability to do it alone, so nothing gets done.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) What is a two-uses-attitude?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A two-uses-attitude means putting an article to a second use, thus giving it a longer lease of life and using up less raw material from nature.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) What can we do to avoid the abuse of paper? (Any two points)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           To avoid the abuse of paper we can use the clean sides of envelopes to write small notes, lists and reminders around the house. We should also avoid the use of paper napkins or paper plates.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) What is the result of an effective way of garbage disposal?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           People who follow the rules for garbage disposal strictly live in neighbourhoods that are clean and beautiful.

           (v) How can the Internet be a powerful tool in spreading environmental awareness?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Internet can be powerful tool in spreading environment awareness. A group of like-minded people can be formed on social media. People can share environmental stories and issues and also pool in solutions and alternatives to educate one another.
          </p>
          <p>
           (vi) How can the making of garden manure be done as a community project?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A large pit can be dig in the colony and kitchen waste can be put in it. When it gets over half full, it will be covered with mud and this way within few months good garden manure is obtained.
          </p>
          <p>
           (vii) How long does it take to make good garden manure?
           <br/>

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below: [6]
           <br/>
           1. Our history makes it evident that the Indian Plastics Industry made a vigorous beginning in 1957 but it took more than 30 years for it to pervade Indian lifestyles. In 1979,’the market for plastics’ was just being seeded by the State-owned Indian Petrochemicals and it was only in 1994 that plastic soft drink bottles became a visible source of annoyance.
           <br/>

           <br/>
           2. In the same year, people in other cities were concerned about the state of public sanitation and also urged regulatory bodies to ban the production, distribution and use of plastic bags. However, the challenge was greater than it appeared at first.
          </p>
          <p>
           3. The massive generation of plastic waste in India is due to rapid urbanisation, spread of retail chains, plastic packaging from grocery to food and vegetable products, to consumer items and cosmetics. The projected high growth rates of GDP and continuing rapid urbanisation suggests that India’s trajectory of plastic consumption and plastic waste is likely to increase.
          </p>
          <p>
           4. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Report of 2018, India stands among few other countries like France, Mongolia and several African countries that have initiated total or partial national level bans on plastics in their jurisdictions. On World Environment Day in 2018, India vowed to phase out single-use plastics by 2022, which gave a much needed impetus to bring this change.
          </p>
          <p>
           5. In this context, thereafter, ten States (Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Meghalaya, Odisha, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu) are currently sending their collected waste to cement plants for co-processing. Twelve other States/UTs are using plastic waste for polymer bitumen road construction and still four other States are using the plastic waste for waste-to-energy plants and oil production. A world of greater possibilities has now opened up to initiate appropriate and concrete actions to build up the necessary institutions and systems before oceans turn, irreversibly, into a thin soup of plastic.
          </p>
          <p>
           6. However, there is no one single masterstroke to counter the challenges witnessed by the staggering plastic waste management in the country. The time is now to formulate robust and inclusive National Action Plans, and while doing so, the country will establish greater transparency to combat the plastic jeopardy in a more sustainable and holistic way.
           <br/>
           Based on your understanding of the passage, answer any six out of the seven questions given below: [6 × 1 = 6]
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) What does the writer mean by ‘visible source of annoyance’?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The writer means that in 1994 plastic bottles were used in such large numbers that empty bottles were visible everywhere and they became annoying for the common man.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Why did people demand a ban on plastics?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           People were concerned about the state of public sanitation so they urged regulatory bodies put a ban on plastics.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) What created a demand for plastics in India?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A demand for plastics in India was created by rapid urbanization, spread of retail chains, plastic packaging for various products from grocery to food and vegetable products, to consumer items and cosmetics.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) What does the line, ‘oceans turn, irreversibly into a thin soup of plastic’, suggest?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           There is a lot of plastic floating in the oceans as it is the most common form of marine debris.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) What step can be taken to combat the challenges of plastic waste management? What will be its impact?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Plastic can be used in cement plants, as polymer, bitumen for roads and in waste to energy plants.
           <br/>
           Plastic waste on earth and in oceans would lessen and it will help combat the plastic jeopardy in a sustainable and holistic way.
          </p>
          <p>
           (vi) With reference to the graph, write one conclusion that can be drawn about the production of plastics in 2019 (approximately).
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           It suggests an increase in India’s trajectory of plastic production which has reached about 500 million tonnes.
          </p>
          <p>
           (vii) What does the upward trend of the graph indicate?
           <br/>
           For the Visually Impaired Candidates only (in lieu of Q. no. (vi) and (vii))
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           It indicates that India’s trajectory of plastic consumption and waste will increase.
          </p>
          <p>
           (vi) What accelerated the partial ban for plastics in India?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           On World Environment Day in 2018, India vowed to phase out single use plastics by 2022, which accelerated the partial ban for plastics.
          </p>
          <p>
           (vii) How are certain states in India recycling plastic waste productively?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Ten states are currently sending their collected waste to cement plants for co-processing.
           <br/>
           Twelve other states are using plastic waste for polymer bitumen road constructions and Four other states are using the plastic waste for waste-to-energy plants and oil production.

           Answer any five out of the six questions given below, within 40 words each : [5 × 2 = 10]
           <br/>
           (i) Explain the metaphor of ‘The Rattrap’ as explained by the peddler.
           <br/>
           (ii) In the Motihari court, what caused the delay in the trial?
           <br/>
           (iii) How does a thing of beauty provide shelter and comfort?
           <br/>
           (iv) How did the Maharaja overcome the difficulty created by a high-ranking British officer?
           <br/>
           (v) When Mr. Lamb tells Derry that, while some describe the sound that the bees make as ‘buzzing’, to him it seems they are singing. What character trait of Mr. Lamb is brought to light? Why?
           <br/>
           (vi) How long would it take Bama to walk home from her school and why?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) The world had never been very kind to the peddler. So it gave him unwanted joy to think of the world with its lands and seas, cities and villages as nothing but a big rattrap that sets baits for people in form of riches, joys and other necessities, and as soon as one got tempted, it closed in on him.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Thousands of peasants gathered around the courthouse as they had heard that a Mahatma who wanted to help them was in trouble with the authorities. The officials had to resort to Gandhi’s help to regulate the crowd. The government was baffled and the prosecutor requested the judge to postpone the trial as the authorities wished to consult their superiors.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Inspite of the problems and miseries that make man’s life gloomy and sad, he does not cease to love life because a thing of beauty gives him joy. It is like a bower, a place under the shade of a tree where he Atfi rest. The streams provide a cooling convert in the hot season. Nature’s beauty gives him everlasting happiness.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) The Maharaja had annoyed a senior British Officer and was in danger of losing his throne. To make amends he sent about fifty samples of expensive diamond rings to the officer’s wife in the hope that she would keep one or two rings as a bribe. But the greedy lady kept all the rings. The Maharaja lost three lakh rupees but he managed to retain his kingdom.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) Mr. Lamb tries to teach Derry the importance of perspective, when he tells him about the sound made by bees. Some people find the bees’ buzzing sound annoying but to others it is pleasant. Mr. Lamb says this to him so that Derry should only listen to those people who say positive things and ignore those who sp6ak callously about him.
          </p>
          <p>
           (vi) It took Bama half an hour to one hour to walk home from her school, although it was possible to cover the distance in ten minutes. This was because on the way many attractions slowed her down. These included fun, games, entertaining novelties and oddities in the streets, the shop and the bazaar.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 6.
           <br/>
           Answer any two of the following in about 120-150 words each. [2 × 4 = 8]
           <br/>
           (i) The tigers’ description as ‘chivalric’ is a contrast to that of Aunt Jennifer. Explain.
           <br/>
           (ii) In the lesson ‘The Rattrap’, the narrator takes an empathetic approach towards the – rattrap seller. Considering the above statement, discuss the narrator’s portrayal of the peddler.
           <br/>
           (iii) How is a thing of beauty a joy forever? Elaborate with reference to the poem?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) The poet refers to the tigers created by Aunt Jennifer as ‘chivalric’ which is in contrast to the lady’s submissive nature. The tigers symbolise strength and splendour. They are gallant, confident and fearless unlike the meek and timid lady who has created them. Through her art work, Aunt Jennifer creates an alternate world of freedom where there is no oppression. She has lived a life of complete domination and constant fear. She creates the tigers as they are gallant and powerful creatures who will always prance proudly and fearlessly. Dominated and terrorised by her husband, Aunt Jennifer has struggled for an existence within the confines of subjugation.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The narrator takes an empathetic approach towards the rattrap seller because of the harsh way in which the peddler has been treated by the world. He has led a sad and monotonous life wherein he had to resort to begging and petty thievery to keep his ‘body and soul together’. When the latent goodness of his heart is awakened by Edla’s warmth and compassion, the peddler finally changes his ways. The narrator makes it evident, from the beginning that the peddler had good reason to become a dishonest person. His chance encounter with Edla was instrumental in changing his mindset. When the peddler received • kindness and sympathy it had a very positive effect on him. It gave him the power to clean himself and enabled him to escape from the world’s rattrap.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) A thing of beauty is a joy forever because it gives us everlasting happiness and leaves such an impact on our mind that we are able to relive the wonderful feeling each time we think about nature’s beauty. A thing of beauty is like a pleasant shelter, a place under the shade of a tree, where we will always be serene and calm. The poet se^s beauty in nature’s scenic beauty, in the sun, the moon, the trees, the sheep, the green pastures and the streams that provide a cooling convert in the hot season. The grand deeds of the ‘mighty dead’ who have made their lives extraordinary because of their achievements are also considered as a thing of beauty that is a source of inspiration for others.
