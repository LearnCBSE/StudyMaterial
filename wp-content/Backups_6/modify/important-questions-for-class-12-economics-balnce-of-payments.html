           Autonomous items, also termed as ‘above the line items’, are those items, which are related to transactions which are determined by considerations of profit (economic motive) and hence, was no concern with the state of BoP.

           Balance of surplus When the receipts of the country on account of autonomous transactions exceed the payments of a country on account of autonomous transactions, this difference is termed as BoP surplus.
           <br/>
           BoP Surplus = R&gt;P, where R = Receipts of the country, P = Payment of the country, e.g., if the receipts of the country is Rs. 200 crore and the payments are Rs. 190 crore, then BoP surplus will be (200 -190) = Rs. 10 crore.

           </strong>
           <strong>
            Balance of Payments. Also explain the concept of Balance of Payments deficit in this context.      (Delhi 2012)

           <strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           Autonomous items, also termed as ‘above the line items’, are those items, which are related to transactions which are determined by considerations of profit (economic motive). Autonomous transactions are that transaction between the residents of two countries which take place due to the considerations of profit. Autonomous items are not conditioned by the BoP status of the country, i.e. these are independent. Autonomous transactions are not done to establish identity of BoP. i.e. current account and capital account.
           <br/>
           Accommodating items, also termed as ‘below the line items’, are those items of BoP that are not determined by considerations of profit but to restore identity of BoP. These are undertaken to maintain balance in the BoP account. These transactions correct the disequilibrium in autonomous items of BoP account. Accommodating transactions are also known as ‘below the line items’ and include foreign exchange reserve and borrowings to meet BoP deficit.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            BoP Deficit
           </strong>
           <br/>
           When the payments of a country on account of autonomous transactions exceed the receipts of the country on account of autonomous transactions, this difference is termed as BoP deficit.
           <br/>
           Deficit in BoP = Receipts on account of autonomous transactions &lt; Payments on account of autonomous transactions Suppose, the receipts of the domestic country is r 200 crore. Where as payments are r 220 crore. Then BoP deficit will be
           <br/>
           = 220 – 200 crore = Rs. 20 crore
