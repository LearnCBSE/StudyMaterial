           <br/>
           1. clause is a group of words that includes a subject and a verb. It may be a sentence or part of a sentence.
           <br/>
           2. There are three kinds of clauses:
          </p>
          <ul>

           3. Noun Clause:
          </p>
          <p>
           A noun clause works like a noun in a sentence. A noun clause starts with words that, what, whatever, who, whom, whoever, whomever.
           <br/>
           Examples:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Whatever you learn will help you write the test.
           </li>
           <li>
            What you said made me cry.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           You can master in
           <a href="/english-grammar/">
            English Grammar
           </a>
           of various classes by our articles like Tenses, Clauses, Prepositions, Story writing, Unseen Passage, Notice Writing etc.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           4. Noun clauses begin with the following connectives:
           <br/>
           (i) Pronouns: what, which, who, whom, whose.
           <br/>
           (ii) Adverbs: when, where, why, how.
           <br/>
           (iii) Conjuctions: if, that, whether.
           <br/>
           For example:
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Class 10 English Grammar - Clauses 1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-101492" height="142" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CBSE-Class-10-English-Grammar-Clauses-1.jpg" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CBSE-Class-10-English-Grammar-Clauses-1.jpg 674w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CBSE-Class-10-English-Grammar-Clauses-1-300x63.jpg 300w" width="674"/>
          </p>
          <p>
           5. Functions of Noun Clauses:
           <br/>
           Noun clauses function like nouns or noun phrases. They can function as subject, object, complement, or object of a preposition, etc:
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Class 10 English Grammar - Clauses 2" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-101493" height="304" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 742px) 100vw, 742px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CBSE-Class-10-English-Grammar-Clauses-2.jpg" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CBSE-Class-10-English-Grammar-Clauses-2.jpg 742w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CBSE-Class-10-English-Grammar-Clauses-2-300x123.jpg 300w" width="742"/>
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) Object of Preposition:
           <br/>
           You should pay attention to what the teacher says.
           <br/>
           There is no complaint except that he comes late.
           <br/>
           There is no meaning in what he says.
           <br/>
           No one is aware of how he has opened the lock.
           <br/>
           Everything depends on whether he helps us or not.
           <br/>
           It was difficult to decide on where we should go for help.
           <br/>
           They couldn’t agree about who should do the work.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           (v) Complement of an Adjective:
           <br/>
           I am not sure where he has gone.
           <br/>
           They are confident that they will find out the thief.
           <br/>
           It is doubtful whether she will reach in time.
          </p>
          <p>
           (vi) Object of an Infinitive:
           <br/>
           She wants to know what is going on here.
           <br/>
           He came to see that he was mistaken.
           <br/>
           She wanted to ask if l could help her.
          </p>
          <p>
           (vii) In Apposition to a Noun (Noun + Noun clause)
           <br/>
           The rumour that he was killed is true.
           <br/>
           The idea that we should set up a factory should be pursued.
           <br/>
           The fact that he has failed surprised his parents.
          </p>
          <p>
           (viii) Object of a Participle:
           <br/>
           Thinking that he would die, they took him to a hospital.
           <br/>
           Hoping that they would win, they felt overjoyed.
          </p>
          <p>
           6. Adverbial Clauses of Condition:
           <br/>
           The adverbial clause of the condition is introduced by if, unless, whether:
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <ul>
           <li>
            <u>
             If you run fast
            </u>
            , you will catch the train.
           </li>
           <li>
            <u>
             Unless you work hard
            </u>
            . you will not pass.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           The underlined words in the above sentences form the adverbial clauses of condition. A conditional clause is a subordinate clause and expresses a condition.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The conditional clauses are of the following types:
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (i) In an if-clause referring to a likely or possible situation in the future, the simple present tense is used. The future tense is used in the main clause:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            If it rains, we’ll go indoors.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Generally, the main clause has the form: shall/will/may/can/must+first form of the verb:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            If she works hard, she will pass.
           </li>
           <li>
            If you request me, I shall help you.
           </li>
           <li>
            If you need a pen, you can take mine.
           </li>
           <li>
            If you want to get good marks, you must work harder.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (ii) In an if-clause referring to a condition that always has the same result, the simple present is used. The simple tense is used in the main clause too:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            If the engine gets too hot, it starts to smoke.
           </li>
           <li>
            If you heat ice, it melts.
           </li>
           <li>
            If you boil water, it evaporates.
           </li>
           <li>
            If you beat a child, he weeps.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (iii) If a conditional clause refers to an unlikely or impossible situation in the present or future, the simple past tense is used. In the main clause, we use ‘should, ‘could, ‘might’, ‘would’, etc + first form of the verb:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            If you ran fast, you might catch the train.
           </li>
           <li>
            If I won a lottery, I would buy a car.
           </li>
           <li>
            I would tell you if I knew the answer.
           </li>
           <li>
            If a thief entered your house, what would you do?
           </li>
           <li>
            If I were rich, I would open a school for the poor.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (iv) If a conditional clause refers to something that did not happen in the past, the past perfect tense is used. In the main clause, we use would have/should have/could have/might have + third form of the verb:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            If she had worked hard, she would have passed.
            <br/>
            (i.e. She didn’t work hard, so she didn’t pass).
           </li>
           <li>
            If he had left early, he might have caught the train.
           </li>
           <li>
            If he had informed me, I would have received him at the railway station.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           But when the main clause is about the present, ‘would’, ‘could, ‘might’, etc. without have is used:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            If you had followed my advice, we would be home by now.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (v) If a conditional clause refers to an unlikely situation in the future, ‘were to’ or ‘should’ followed by an infinitive, is sometimes used instead of the simple past tense:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            If you should meet him, tell him to come here.
           </li>
           <li>
            If she were to die before you, who would look after your children?
           </li>
           <li>
            If you need any help, ring me up.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (vi) ‘If only’ is used to express a wish with reference to present or future time:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            If only I were rich.
           </li>
           <li>
            If only I could swim.
           </li>
           <li>
            If only I knew her name.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (vii) ‘If only’ is used to express a wish that past events had been different:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            If only he had remembered to post that letter.
           </li>
           <li>
            If only I had met her.
           </li>
           <li>
            If only he had spoken the truth.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           7. Adverbial Clauses of Time:
           <br/>
           Adverb Clause An adverb clause works like an adverb and modifies a verb, adjective clause or another adverb clause in a sentence.
          </p>
          <p>
           The subordinating conjunctions used for adverb clauses are as follows:
          </p>
          <table style="height: 97px;" width="716">
           <tbody>
            <tr>
             <td width="139">
              Time
             </td>
             <td width="475">
              when, whenever, since, until, before, after, while, as, by the time, as soon as
             </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
             <td width="139">
              Cause and effect
             </td>
             <td width="475">
              because, since, now that, as long as, so, so that
             </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
             <td width="139">
              Contrast
             </td>
             <td width="475">
              although, even, whereas, while, though
             </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
             <td width="139">
              Condition
             </td>
             <td width="475">
              if, unless, only if, whether or not, even if, provided that, in case
             </td>
            </tr>
           </tbody>
          </table>
          <p>
           Adverb Clause Examples:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Don’t go before he comes.
           </li>
           <li>
            He takes medicine because he is ill.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           8. Relative Clauses:
           <br/>
           The relative clause does the function of an adjective in a sentence. That is why it is also called an adjective clause. We put a relative clause immediately after the noun which refers to the person, thing, or group we are talking about.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The boy who came into the house was my friend.
           </li>
           <li>
            The house which our neighbour bought is made of stone.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           A relative clause is essential to the clear understanding of the noun it defines or qualifies. For example,
           <br/>
           ‘ Who came into the house ’ is a relative clause without which it will not be clear to which ‘boy’ we are referring.
          </p>
          <p>
           9. Defining and Non-defining Relative Clauses:
           <br/>
           There are two kinds of relative clauses—defining and non-defining relative clauses. Defining relative clauses limit the noun or pronoun to which they refer to a particular type or examples. They answer the questions which!, what? whose? In the two example sentences above the relative clauses restrict “the boy’ and ‘the house’ to a particular ‘boy ’ or a particular ‘house’.
           <br/>
           Non-defining clauses simply give us additional information about the nouns, pronouns and clauses to which they refer. For example:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Anwar, who returned yesterday, will come to meet us.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           There are some general rules which should be noted about relative clauses and relative pronouns:
           <br/>
           (i) A non-defining clause is separated by commas (see the above sentence).
           <br/>
           (ii) A defining clause is not separated by commas.
           <br/>
           (iii) In a non-defining clause the relative pronoun cannot be omitted.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Satish, who/whom you met yesterday, is a friend of mine.
           </li>
           <li>
            Here the relative pronoun ‘who/whom’ cannot be omitted.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (iv) In a defining clause, we can omit the relative pronoun except when it is the subject of a verb:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The woman yon met yesterday is my mother.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           In this sentence, the relative pronoun is omitted. But we cannot omit it in the following sentence:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The boy who gave you this book is my friend.
           </li>
           <li>
            This is because here the relative pronoun ‘who’ is the subject of the verb ‘gave’.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (v) In a non-defining clause the preposition governing the relative is rarely placed at the end of the clause:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            This is Mohan, about whom I was talking.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (vi) In a defining clause the preposition governing the relative is generally placed at the end of the clause:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            This is the boy I was talking about.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (vii) The relative pronouns ‘which’, ‘who’, ‘whose’, ‘whom’ are found in both defining and non-defining clauses. But the pronoun ‘that’ is only found in defining clauses.
          </p>
          <p>
           (viii) The relative pronouns differ according to whether they refer to persons or things and according to thier case:
           <br/>

          </p>
          <p>
           (ix) Relative clauses are introduced by relative adverbs ‘where’, ‘”when’, ‘why’.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            This is the house where we lived.
           </li>
           <li>
            This is the time when the winter season sets in.
           </li>
           <li>
            This is the reason why I left this place.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           10. Use of Pronouns for Persons:
           <br/>
           (i) In the nominative case, we use ‘who’ or ‘that’. ‘That’ is used after superlatives and after all, nobody, no one, somebody, someone, anybody, etc. when we can use either
           <sup>
            ‘
           </sup>
           who’ or ‘that’:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            This is the best that I could have done in that situation.
           </li>
           <li>
            The girl who cheated you is called Romola.
           </li>
           <li>
            The policeman who arrested the thief has white hair.
           </li>
           <li>
            All who/that listened to his speech praised him.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (ii) In the objective case, we use ‘whom’, ‘who’, ‘that’. ‘ Whom is considered more formal than ‘who’. However, in spoken English we use ‘who’ or ‘that’. There is a tendency to omit the objective relative pronoun altogether:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The boy whom/who I met is called Ramesh.
            <br/>
            Or
           </li>
           <li>
            The boy that I met is called Ramesh.
            <br/>
            Or
           </li>
           <li>
            The boy I met is called Ramesh.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (iii) We use ‘whom’ or ‘that’ with a preposition.
           <br/>
           Generally, the preposition is placed before the relative pronoun:
           <br/>
           The boy to whom I was speaking is my neighbour. In informal speech, the preposition is usually moved to the end of the clause and then ‘whom’ is often replaced by ‘that’ or it is omitted:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The man to whom I gave it was a foreigner.
           </li>
           <li>
            The man who/whom I gave it to was a foreigner.
           </li>
           <li>
            The man that I gave it to was a foreigner.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (iv) In the possessive case, we use the relative pronoun ‘whose’:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Boys whose result has not been declared can meet the principal.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           11. Use of Pronouns for Things:
           <br/>
           (i) In the nominative case, the relative pronouns ‘which’ and ‘that’ are used. Which is considered more formal:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            This is the pen which/that cost me £5.
           </li>
           <li>
            This is the house which/that has been sold.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (ii) In the objective case, we use ‘which’ or ‘that’ or omit the relative pronoun:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The pen which/that I bought yesterday was beautiful.
           </li>
           <li>
            The pen I bought yesterday was beautiful.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           We generally use ‘that’ after all, much, little, everything, none, no and compounds of no or after superlatives or we omit the relative pronoun altogether.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            All the mangoes that fall are eaten by children.
           </li>
           <li>
            This is the best place (that) I have ever seen.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (iii) When we use the objective case with a preposition, we place the preposition before ‘which’. But it is more usual to move it to the end of the clause, using ‘which’ or ‘that’ or we omit the relative pronoun altogether:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The chair on which I was sitting was made of teak wood.
           </li>
           <li>
            The chair which!that I was sitting on was made of teak wood.
           </li>
           <li>
            The chair I was sitting on was made of teak wood.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (iv) In the possessive case, we use the relative pronoun ‘whose’:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The house whose walls are made of mud bricks will not be durable
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           12. Relative Pronouns used in Non-defining Clauses:
           <br/>
           Form:
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Class 10 English Grammar - Clauses 4" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-101495" height="103" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CBSE-Class-10-English-Grammar-Clauses-4.jpg" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CBSE-Class-10-English-Grammar-Clauses-4.jpg 686w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CBSE-Class-10-English-Grammar-Clauses-4-300x45.jpg 300w" width="686"/>
           <br/>
           13. Use for Persons
           <br/>
           (i) In the nominative case, only ‘who’ is used:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            My father, who is a businessman, has an expensive car.
           </li>
           <li>
            Nitin, who is my friend, has gone to Dehradun.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (ii) In the objective case, we use ‘whom’ and “who’. ‘Who’ is sometimes used in conversation:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            My manager, whom I dislike, is an ill-tempered man.
           </li>
           <li>
            He introduced me to her girl friend, whom I had known before.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (iii) ‘ Whom’ is used with a preposition in the objective case. We can also use ‘ who’ if we move the preposition to the end of the clause:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Sumitra, to whom I gave a present, is my sister.
           </li>
           <li>
            Sumitra, who I gave a present to, is my sister.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (iv) We use ‘whose’ in the possessive case:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Shakespeare, whose plays are world-famous, was a British dramatist.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           14. Use for Things:
           <br/>
           (i) We use ‘which’ in the nominative case:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            His car, which is so old, broke down on the way.
           </li>
           <li>
            His office, which is near our house, is painted green.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (ii) In the objective also, we use ‘which’:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            “The Merchant of Venice”, which you read yesterday, was written by William Shakespeare.
           </li>
           <li>
            The tree near my house, which I wanted to cut down, was uprooted in a storm.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (iii) The relative pronoun ‘which’ is also used with a preposition:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            My house, for which I paid rupees fifty lacs, is beautiful.
           </li>
           <li>
            My house, which I paid rupees fifty lacs for, is beautiful.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (iv) In the possessive case, ‘whose’ or ‘of which’ are used:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
