           Question 1.
           <br/>
           How did the first world war lead to a rise in defence expenditure in India? (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Due to the first world war, war loans, funds required to meet the needs of soldiers for food, uniforms, weapons and ammunition rose exponentially. The British Government was under a lot of debt and tried to offset it by levying taxes on Indian citizens to earn greater revenue. Thus, the defence expenditure of India grew exponentially.
          </p>
          <p>
           Related Theory:
           <br/>
           Income tax was introduced to balance the sudden rise in expenditure due to the first world war.

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Agriculture and industry are not exclusive to each other. What does the given statement mean? (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Agriculture and industry cannot develop or exist individually. Their development is integrated and development of each sector augments the development of the other. In other words, each of them are dependent upon the other for its existence and development.
          </p>
          <p>
           Related Theory:
           <br/>
           Agricultural products are primary sector goods. They are processed and turned into finished goods by the manufacturing sector. The sectors are both interconnected and cannot develop individually because the products of one sector become the raw material for another sector. Hence, they always go hand in hand.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           The Supreme Court passed an order to reduce the influence of money and criminals in politics and political parties. Mention the measure taken by the Supreme Court in this regard. (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Supreme Court has made it mandatory for every candidate contesting the elections to file an affidavit giving details of the immovable and movable assets possessed by him and the criminal cases pending against him.

          </div>
          <p>
           Related Theory:
           <br/>
           An affidavit is a signed document submitted to an officer, where a person makes a sworn statement regarding her personal information. It has to be signed by a notarised officer.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Enlist two consequences of greater foreign investment and greater foreign trade. (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Two consequences of greater foreign trade are:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Greater foreign investment and foreign trade leads to greater integration of production and markets across
            <br/>
            countries.
           </li>
           <li>
            It also leads to greater economic development and regional growth across the country.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           Related Theory:
           <br/>
           Foreign trade helps native producers reach a wider customer and consumer base. International markets pay better for goods than native markets.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Read the data about people’s opinions expressed in forms of numbers about their support for democracy and answer the questions that follow:

           Question 6.
           <br/>
           Why was the Lahore Congress session so consequential for the Indian national movement?
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Mahatma Gandhi once again decided to call off the Civil Disobedience movement and entered into a pact with Irwin on 5 March 1931. Support the statement by enlisting incidents which led up to the Gandhi-lrwin pact. (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Lahore Congress session is so important for the Indian national movement because of the following reasons:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            In December 1929, the Lahore Congress formalised the demand of ‘Purna Swaraj’ or complete independence for India for the first time. This was organised under the presidency of Jawaharlal Nehru.
           </li>
           <li>
            This session also declared that January 26th, 1930 would be celebrated as Independence Day.
           </li>
           <li>
            It was when people decided to take a pledge to struggle for complete independence. Resolution to fight for complete independence was declared for the first time in this session.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           OR
           <br/>
           Following circumstances led up to the Gandhi
           <br/>
           Irwin pact:
           <br/>
           1. Gandhi’s letter comprising 11 demands from the British Government was rejected by Irwin in 1930-31. Gandhi had launched the Civil disobedience movement and refused to participate in the first round table conference as a consequence.
          </p>
          <p>
           2. Later, to appease him, Irwin promised to offer some concessions. To further the talks, Gandhi called off the Civil Disobedience movement and signed the Gandhi-lrwin pact
          </p>
          <p>
           3. Through the pact, Lord Irwin released all the prisoners arrested during the movement while Mahatma Gandhi agreed to attend the Second Round Table Conference.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 7.
           <br/>
           What is a Barter system? Why does it no longer function today? (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A system where the goods are directly exchanged without the use of money as an exchange medium is called the barter system. Double coincidence of wants is an essential feature of the barter system. In this system, sellers agree to sell and buy each other’s commodities.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is a difficult condition to achieve. It is extremely difficult and inconvenient to find a pair of sellers who want to buy the exact thing the other seller wants to sell. Hence it does not function anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 8.
           <br/>
           What does an ideal democratic government promise? Mention few points. (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           An ideal democratic government promises a lot of things. Few of these promises can be enlisted as:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            It promise to conduct regular free and fair elections, open public debate on major policies and legislation.
           </li>
           <li>
            It ensures transparency and citizens’ right to information about the government and its functions.
           </li>
           <li>
            An ideal democratic government promises to follow procedures and is accountable to the people.
           </li>
          </ol>

           Question 9.
           <br/>
           The quality of democracy depends on the degree of public participation. Elaborate.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           “Mohammad Iqbal’s thoughts on communalism and separate electorates were radical and completely different from Gandhi’s.” Throw some light on Iqbal’s thoughts on communalism keeping the given statement in mind. (5)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The quality of democracy depends on the degree of public participation. This can be argued as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            To solve the problem of bad politics, ordinary people have to strive and influence leaders to perform better politics.
           </li>
           <li>
            It is difficult to reform politics if citizens simply criticise it from the outside. They have to participate and produce better alternatives.
           </li>
           <li>
            Public participation makes them aware and the leaders more responsible and accountable towards these enlightened people.

           Mohammad Iqbal reiterated the importance of separate electorates for the muslims as a safeguard for political interests of the minority while Gandhi believed it obstructed the process of national integration.
           <br/>
           1. Iqbal also believed that Communalism was indispensable to the formation of a harmonious whole in a country like India.
          </p>
          <p>
           2. He asserted that Indian society was territorially different from European countries. The principle of European democracy could not be applied to India without recognising the significance and relevance of communal groups.

           3. India is a land of racial and religious variety. He believed that those who understood the word “nation” to mean a kind of universal amalgamation in which no communal entity ought to retain its private individuality were wrong and hence separate electorates were necessary to retain private individualities.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           The significance of mass communications can be underlined in the following points:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Mass communication provides mass entertainment.
           </li>
           <li>
            Creates awareness among people about programmes and policies through radio, television, newspapers, magazines, books and films without any prejudice based on caste, colour, gender or region.
           </li>
           <li>
            Information is spread through mass communication mediums like the All India Radio (Akashwani) through a variety of programmes in national, regional and local languages.
           </li>
           <li>
            Doordarshan and other channels broadcast a variety of programmes from entertainment, educational to sports, etc. for people of different age groups.
           </li>
           <li>
            Thus Mass communication is a source of information about the world and infotainment.
           </li>

           The government decided in 1991 that Indian producers and companies were ready to compete with producers around the globe. It thus changed the economic policy of India:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The government felt that this competition from opening the economy to the world would improve the performance of the producers within the country.
           </li>
           <li>
            The barriers on foreign trade and foreign investment were also removed.
           </li>
           <li>
            This was done to invite investments from all over the world. This boosted our economic growth.
           </li>
           <li>
            The policies also involved invitations to prosperous foreign companies.
           </li>
           <li>
            The government invited foreign produers to set up factories and offices here which would lead to new employment and growth.

           Question 11.
           <br/>
           Read the source given below and answer the questions that follow:
           <br/>
           Rama is working in a neighbouring field. She works as an agricultural labourer. There are several months in the year when Rama has no work, and needs credit to meet the daily expenses. Expenses on sudden illnesses or functions in the family are also met through loans. Rama has to depend on her employer, a medium landowner in Sonpur, for credit. The landowner charges an interest rate of 5 per cent per month. Rama repays the money by working for the landowner. Most of the time, Rama has to take a fresh loan, before the previous loan has been repaid. At present, she owes the landowner Rs 5,000. Though the landowner doesn’t treat her well, she continues to work for him since she can get loans from him when in need. Rama tells us that the only source of credit for the landless people in Sonpur are the landowner-employers.
           <br/>
           (A) In the given case, why does Rama borrow money only from her landowner? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The only source of credit for the landless people in remotest parts of the country are the landowners and employers. There is no formal source of credit in such areas. It might also be possible that Rama borrows from the landowner because she has no collateral to pledge to the bank as a security.
          </p>
          <p>
           (B) What is a suitable remedy for Rama to come out of this situation? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Rama should borrow from a formal sector credit source like a bank or a cooperative society instead.
           <br/>
           Explanation: If Rama begins to borrow money from a bank, she might get it at a lesser rate of interest and would be able to settle her transaction with the Landowner once and for all. She would be out of the debt trap finally.
          </p>
          <p>
           (C) What would be the outstanding amount
           <br/>
           for Rama to repay to the landowner if she borrowed 6000 rupees from the landowner according to the terms of credit mentioned in the source for 5 months? (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Principal (P) = ₹ 6000
           <br/>
           Time = 5 months
           <br/>
           Rate of Interest = 5% per month
           <br/>
           Interest = ?
           <br/>
           Amount = ?
           <br/>
           Amount = P\(\left(1+\frac{r}{100}\right)^{\mathrm{t}}\)
           <br/>
           Amount = 6000\(\left(1+\frac{5}{100}\right)^{5}\) = ₹ 7,657.7

           Question 12.
           <br/>
           Read the source given below and answer the questions that follow:
           <br/>
           Production of goods in large quantities after processing from raw materials to more valuable products is called manufacturing. Do you know that paper is manufactured from wood, sugar from sugarcane, iron and steel from iron ore and aluminium from bauxite? Do you also know that some types of clothes are manufactured from yarn which itself is an industrial product? People employed in the secondary activities manufacture the primary materials into finished goods. The workers employed in steel factories, cars, breweries, textile industries, bakeries etc. fall into this category. Some people are employed in providing services. In this chapter, we are mainly concerned with manufacturing industries which fall in the secondary sector. The economic strength of a country is measured by the development of manufacturing industries.
           <br/>
           (A) What are the two types of manufacturing industries classified according to the capital investment? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           According to the criterion of capital investment, they are classified into Small scale and Large Scale industries.
           <br/>
           Small scale industries require less capital investment and the production is on a smaller scale, confined to two or more industry units.
           <br/>
           Large scale industries require large capital investment and the production is on a huge scale, almost covering multiple states or even countries.
          </p>
          <p>
           Related Theory:
           <br/>
           An industry, when classified according to capital investment, is defined with reference to the maximum investment allowed on the assets of a unit. This limit has changed over a period of time. At present the maximum investment allowed is One crore rupees for small scale industries.
          </p>
          <p>
           (B) What would happen to the economic prosperity of a country if there were no manufacturing industries located in it? (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           If a country had no manufacturing industries, it would be extremely difficult to sustain it because manufacturing industries produce goods and services which are both exported and consumed by the citizens of the country. Exports bring foreign currency in the country. Since, manufacturing industries are directly linked to the economic prosperity of a country, it will be difficult for such a country to progress economically.
          </p>
          <p>
           Related Theory
           <br/>
           It would have to rely on imports for the minutest requirements of food and sustenance. It will also have very few jobs Hence the country would be very poor.
          </p>
          <p>
           (C) What would you do if you were the head of such a country? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           If I were the head of such a country, I’d insist and invest in setting up some basic industries at the least to help sustain the citizens.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            I would encourage the citizens to research and develop new technologies, advanced methods and establish Iron and Steel, Textiles, Food industry in the first phase followed by other industries in the upcoming phases.
           </li>
           <li>
            This would help the country to develop and create more jobs.
           </li>
           <li>
            This would also increase their living standards and bring urbanisation.
           </li>
