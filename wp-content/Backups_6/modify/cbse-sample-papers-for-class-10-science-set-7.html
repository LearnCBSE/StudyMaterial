           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Which of the following is NOT a function of the liver?
           <br/>
           (a) Detoxification of harmful substances
           <br/>
           (c) Regulation of blood sugar levels
           <br/>
           (b) Production of bile for digestion
           <br/>
           (d) Production of red blood cells
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (d) Production of red blood cells
           <br/>
           Explanation: The liver performs numerous vital functions in the human body but is not responsible for producing red blood cells.
           <br/>
           (a) The liver plays a crucial role in detoxifying harmful substances, such as drugs and alcohol, by breaking them down into less harmful forms that can be excreted from the body.
           <br/>
           (b) The liver produces bile, a greenish-yellow fluid that aids in the digestion and absorption of fats in the small intestine.
           <br/>
           (c) The liver plays a key role in maintaining blood sugar levels by storing excess glucose as glycogen and releasing it when blood sugar levels drop.
           <br/>
           (d) Although the liver is involved in the breakdown of old or damaged red blood cells, the primary site of red blood cell production is the bone marrow, not the liver.
           <br/>
           Understanding the liver’s functions is essential for recognizing that it does not produce red blood cells.
          </p>

           (c) Piamater, Arachnoid and Duramater
           <br/>
           Explanation: The brain is protected by cranial meninges, which are made up of three layers: an outside layer called duramater, a very thin middle layer called arachnoid, and an inner layer called piamater (which is in contact with the brain tissue). Thus, the layer of the brain from inside towards the outside is: Piamater, Arachnoid and Duramater.

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Which of the following is an advantage of sexual reproduction over asexual reproduction?
           <br/>
           (a) Rapid population growth
           <br/>
           (b) Greater adaptability to changing environments
           <br/>
           (c) Production of genetically identical offspring
           <br/>
           (d) Conservation of energy and resources
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (b) Greater adaptability to changing environments
           <br/>
           Explanation:
           <br/>
           (a) Asexual reproduction often leads to rapid population growth because offspring are produced without the need for a partner. However, this is not an advantage of sexual reproduction, which involves the fusion of gametes and typically has a slower reproductive rate.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Sexual reproduction allows for genetic recombination, which leads to offspring with a mix of genetic traits from both parents. This diversity increases the chances of survival in changing environments. It provides a wider range of genetic variation for natural selection to act upon, enabling populations to adapt to new conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) This statement describes a characteristic of asexual reproduction, not sexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction results in offspring that are genetically identical to the parent since they are derived from a single parent’s genetic material.
          </p>
          <p>
           (d) Asexual reproduction is generally more efficient in terms of energy and resource conservation since it does not require the production of gametes or the search for a mating partner. Sexual reproduction, on the other hand, involves the production of specialized reproductive cells and the expenditure of energy to find and attract a mate.

           Question 11.
           <br/>
           Blood glucose levels are regulated in the human body by the secretion of two hormones. Which hormone is secreted when glucose concentration increases in blood?
           <br/>
           (a) Insulin
           <br/>
           (b) Glucagon
           <br/>
           (c) ADH
           <br/>
           (d) Thyroxine
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Insulin
           <br/>
           Insulin is responsible for lowering the blood glucose level whereas glucagon is opposite in function. Hence, deficiency of insulin in the body leads to diabetes mellitus.

           <br/>
           (d) Genes cannot acquire mutations in their sequence.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (d) Genes cannot acquire mutations in their sequence.
           <br/>
           Explanation: Genes can acquire mutations. A gene mutation is a change in the DNA sequence that ( makes up a permanent gene and differs from the sequence found in most people.

           Question 13.
           <br/>
           The radius of curvature of a concave mirror is 12 cm. Then, the focal length will be
           <br/>
           (a) 12 cm
           <br/>
           (b) 6 cm
           <br/>
           (c) -24 cm
           <br/>
           (d) -6 cm
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (d) -6 cm
           <br/>
           Given, the radius of curvature, R = 12 cm
           <br/>
           We know that the focal length of the concave mirror has a negative value.
           <br/>
           Hence, focal length, f = \(\frac{-R}{2}=\frac{-12}{2}\) = -6 cm

           Question 14.
           <br/>
           Which of the following statements is NOT true regarding asexual reproduction in plants?
           <br/>
           (a) Plants that reproduce asexually reach maturity faster than those who reproduce sexually.
           <br/>
           (b) Plants that reproduce asexually have greater genetic diversity than those that reproduce sexually.
           <br/>
           (c) Plants that reproduce asexually are more stable than those that reproduce sexually.
           <br/>
           (d) Plants that reproduce asexually create offspring that are identical to the parent plant.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (b) Plants that reproduce asexually have greater genetic diversity than those that reproduce sexually.
           <br/>
           Explanation: Asexual reproduction in plants involves the production of offspring without the need for the fusion of gametes. Asexual reproduction allows plants to produce offspring more rapidly since they don’t need to go through the process of producing flowers, attracting pollinators, and developing seeds.
          </p>
          <p>
           Asexual reproduction, results in genetic clones of the parent plant. As a result, asexual reproduction leads to limited genetic diversity among offspring, as they have identical genetic information.
          </p>
          <p>
           Asexual reproduction provides stability in the offspring since they inherit the exact genetic traits of the parent plant. This stability can be advantageous in a stable and unchanging environment since offspring with the same genetic makeup as the parent are well-suited to their surroundings.

           Question 15.
           <br/>
           Surgical methods of birth control include
           <br/>
           (a) vasectomy and spermicide
           <br/>
           (b) intra-uterine device and tubectomy
           <br/>
           (c) vasectomy and tubectomy
           <br/>
           (d) tubectomy and spermicide
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (c) vasectomy and tubectomy
           <br/>
           In vasectomy (males) a small portion of vas deferens is removed or tied. In tubectomy, (females) a small portion of the fallopian tube is removed or tied.

           Question 16.
           <br/>
           A couple has two children, one with blue eyes and the other with brown eyes. Both parents have brown
           <br/>
           eyes. Which of the following options best explains this scenario?
           <br/>
           (a) Eye colour follows a dominant-recessive pattern, with blue eyes being the dominant trait.
           <br/>
           (b) Eye colour follows a dominant-recessive pattern, with brown eyes being the dominant trait.
           <br/>
           (c) Eye colour is determined by multiple genes and is not strictly governed by a dominant-recessive pattern.
           <br/>
           (d) Eye colour is determined solely by environmental factors and is not influenced by genetics.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (b) Eye colour follows a dominant-recessive pattern, with brown eyes being the dominant trait.
           <br/>
           Explanation: The inheritance of eye colour follows a more complex pattern than a simple dominant-recessive relationship. However, in this specific scenario, where both parents have brown eyes and one child has blue eyes, it can be inferred that brown eyes (the trait observed in the parents) are dominant over blue eyes. This is because the child inherited a recessive allele for blue eyes from both: parents, resulting in the expression of the recessive trait.

           Question 25.
           <br/>
           Find the distance at which an object should be placed in front of a convex lens of focal length 10 cm to obtain an image of double its size.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (a) Why does the sky appear dark instead of blue to an astronaut?
           <br/>
           (b) Why does the sun appear reddish early in the morning?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Given, focal length of lens, f = 10 cm
           <br/>
           Distance of an object, u = ?
           <br/>
           In convex lens, the image is real and virtual.
           <br/>
           ∴ Magnification, m = \(\frac{v}{u}\) = ±2
           <br/>
           ⇒ v = ±2u
           <br/>
           Using lens formula, \(\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{v}-\frac{1}{u}\)
           <br/>
           Case I: If v = +2u
           <br/>
           \(\frac{1}{10}=\frac{1}{2 u}-\frac{1}{u}\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ \(\frac{1}{10}=\frac{1-2}{2 u}=\frac{-1}{2 u}\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ u = -5 cm
           <br/>
           Case II: If v = -2u
           <br/>
           \(\frac{1}{10}=\frac{1}{-2 u}-\frac{1}{u}=\frac{-1-2}{2 u}=\frac{-3}{2 u}\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ u = -15 cm (2)
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (a) The sky appears dark to the astronauts because there is no atmosphere and hence, no scattering of light takes place in space. (1)
           <br/>
           (b) At sunrise and sunset, the sun and the sky appear red. Light from the sun near the horizon passes through thicker layers of air and covers a larger distance in the atmosphere before reaching our eyes. Near the horizon, most of the blue light and shorter wavelengths are scattered away by the particles. Therefore, the light that reaches our eyes is of longer wavelengths. This gives rise to the reddish appearance of the sun and the sky. (1)

           Question 26.
           <br/>
           What is biological magnification? Will the levels of this magnification be different at different levels of the ecosystem?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The increase in concentration of harmful toxic substances in the body of organisms at each trophic level of a food chain is called biological magnification. Yes, the levels of this magnification will be different at different levels of the ecosystem because the concentration of chemicals goes on increasing at different trophic levels. It is maximum at higher trophic levels and minimum at lower trophic levels. Suppose a food chain is Grass → Rabbit → Eagle, it will be the highest in eagle and minimum in the grass.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Zinc is more reactive than copper. So, it will displace copper from CuSO4. Hence, this reaction will take place. (1)
           <br/>
           (b) Iron is less reactive than zinc, so it cannot displace zinc from zinc sulphate solution. The reaction will not take place. (1)
           <br/>
           (c) Zinc is more reactive than iron, it will displace iron from FeSO4 solution. Hence, this reaction will take place. (1)

           Question 30.
           <br/>
           While preparing a cake, baking powder is generally used. However, if your mother decides to use baking
           <br/>
           soda instead of baking powder for the cake recipe at home.
           <br/>
           (i) How will it affect the taste of the cake and why?
           <br/>
           (ii) How can baking soda be converted into baking powder?
           <br/>
           (iii) What is the role of tartaric acid added to baking soda?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Baking soda is sodium hydrogen carbonate, on heating, it is converted into sodium carbonate which is bitter in taste. Thus, if baking soda is used, the taste of the cake changes.

          <p>
           (ii) Baking powder is a mixture of baking soda, cream of tartar (a dry acid), and sometimes com starch. Therefore, baking soda can be converted into baking powder by the addition of an appropriate amount of tartaric acid to it.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Tartaric acid is added to neutralise the sodium carbonate formed on heating by the decomposition of NaHCO

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Given, resistance, R = 2 Ω
           <br/>
           Maximum power, P
           <sub>
            max

           Maximum current, I
           <sub>
            max
           </sub>
           =?
           <br/>
           As we know, P = I
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
           R
           <br/>
           ⇒ I = \(\sqrt{\frac{P}{R}}=\sqrt{\frac{18}{2}}\) = 3A = I
           <sub>
            max
           </sub>
           <br/>
           The maximum current that can flow through resistor A is 3A. This current divides along B and C because they are in parallel combinations.
           <br/>
           (b) Voltage across B and C remain the same and hence I ∝ \(\frac{1}{R}\)
           <br/>
           Since B and C have the same resistance same current flows through them.
           <br/>
           i.e. \(\frac{3}{2}\) = 1.5A flows through B and C.

           Question 32.
           <br/>
           How do the guard cells regulate the opening and closing of stomatal pores?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Guard cells are kidney shaped cells which contain thicker inner walls and thin outer walls. During day time they perform the photosynthesis process due to the presence of chloroplasts in them. When there is an increase in solute concentration inside the guard cells, water from subsidiary cells rushes inside through osmosis as a result guard cells swell up. The thin outer wall bulges out and the thick inner wall is pulled inside thus stomata opens. During night time reverse happens, water rushes out from the guard cells and they become flaccid closing the stomatal pore. Thus, turgour pressure of guard cells helps in the closing and opening of stomata.

           Question 33.
           <br/>
           Why should biodegradable and non-biodegradable wastes be discarded in two separate dustbins? Also, mention about 3R’s.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           3R is an initiative that can be used to minimize and manage waste generation, usage, and disposal. Biodegradable materials are broken down by microorganisms in nature into simple harmless substances. Non-biodegradable materials need different treatments like heat and temperature for disposal and hence, both should be discarded in two different dustbins. (1)
           <br/>
           The 3 R’s are as follows.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Reduce: This means to cut back on the amount of trash we generate.
           </li>
           <li>
            Reuse: It means to find new ways to use things that otherwise would have been thrown out.
           </li>

           (ii) Which law is followed by all chemical reactions?
           <br/>
           (iii) Name four types of chemical reactions.
           <br/>
           (iv) Give an example of precipitation reactions.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A chemical reaction is the transformation of a chemical substance into another chemical substance. Only a rearrangement of atoms takes place in a chemical reaction. Old bonds are broken, and new bonds are formed.
          </p>
          <p>
           Some of the characteristics of chemical reactions are:
           <br/>
           1. Change in colour: In some reactions, there is a change in colour after the reaction. For example, the chemical reaction between potassium iodide solution and lead nitrate solution is characterised by the change in colour from colourless to the appearance of yellow colour due to the formation of lead iodide.

          </p>
          <p>
           2. state change: In some reactions, a change of state takes place during the reaction. The reaction might start with gaseous or liquid reactants, but end up with a solid product and vice-versa. For example: Ammonia gas reacts with hydrogen chloride gas to produce solid ammonium chloride.

          <p>
           3. temperature change: Temperature change is characteristic of many reactions. For example, the chemical reaction between quicklime and water forms slaked lime. In this reaction, the temperature of the reaction is increased due to the evolution of heat.

          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) All chemical reactions follow the law of chemical combination.
          </p>

           Question 38.
           <br/>
           The food material taken in during the process of nutrition is used in cells to provide energy for various life processes. Diverse organisms do this in different ways – some use oxygen to break-down glucose completely into carbon dioxide and water, some use other pathways that do not involve oxygen. In all cases, the first step is the break-down of glucose, a six-carbon molecule, into a three-carbon molecule called pyruvate. This process takes place in the cytoplasm. Further, the pyruvate may be converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide. This process takes place in yeast during fermentation. Since this process occurs in the absence of air (oxygen), it is called anaerobic respiration. Break- down of pyruvate using oxygen takes place in the mitochondria. This process breaks up the three-carbon pyruvate molecule to give three molecules of carbon dioxide. The other product is water. Since this process takes place in the presence of air (oxygen), it is called aerobic respiration.
          </p>
          <p>
           The following process is carried out:

           2. Blow air through this lime water.
           <br/>
           3. Note how long it takes for the lime water to turn milky.
           <br/>
           4. Use a syringe or pichkari to pass air through some fresh lime water taken in another test tube.
           <br/>
           5 .Note how long it takes for this lime water to turn milky.
           <br/>
           6. It is observed that the syringe takes more time to turn lime water milky
           <br/>
           (a) Explain why lime water turn milky instantaneously?

           OR
           <br/>
           Name the process in which carbon dioxide is absorbed?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Our body cells produce carbon dioxide through the oxidation of food. This gas is exhaled outside through the lungs. Lime water reacts with CO, to form an insoluble precipitate. This turns lime water milky.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Syringe takes more time to turn lime water milky because the syringe push atmospheric air throv the lime water. Atmospheric air has less quantity of carbon dioxide. Therefore, it takes more time.
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) Through the process of Respiration, carbon dioxide is released.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create ox and energy in sugar. Thus, in this process, carbon dioxide is absorbed.

           <br/>
           (b) Since B has the least refractive index, it indicates that B is much optically rarer than all other mediums, hence light travels fastest in medium B. (1)
           <br/>
           (c) Refractive index of X
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 10 Science Set 6 with Solutions Q39.2" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-152027" height="118" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-Science-Set-6-with-Solutions-Q39.2.png" width="276"/>

           ∴ The refractive index of Q w.r.t, P is,
           <br/>
           \(P \mu_Q=\frac{1}{Q \mu_P}=\frac{1}{2}=0.5\) (2)
