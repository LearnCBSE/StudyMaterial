           Study the verbs given in Column A and Column B. How do they differ from each other ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The verbs in column A are all non-finites, ie, they show the non-finite position of the action denoted by them.
          </p>
          <p>
           The verbs in Column A are not controlled by the number, person and tense of their subject. Therefore they are non-finites.
           <br/>
           The verbs in Column B are controlled by the number, person and tense of their subject. Therefore they are finites.

           One day there came some strange news. Everybody was talking about it. Round eyes, busy mouths, ………………. voices-everybody was talking about it.
          </p>
          <p>
           One of the stars of the night sky had begun ………………. This star had always been a very tiny star, of no importance at all. It had shone up there for billions and trillions and zillions of years in the Constellation of Orion, In all its time this tiny star had never changed in any way.
          </p>
          <p>
           Now suddenly, it began to get bigger. Astronomers ………………. through their telescopes, noticed it first. They watched it with ………………. frowns.
          </p>
          <p>
           The tiny star was definitely getting bigger. And not just bigger. But bigger and bigger and Bigger. Each night it was BIGGER.
          </p>
          <p>
           Bigger than the Dog-star, the large, coloured twinkler at the heel of the Hunter Orion.
          </p>
          <p>
           Bigger than Jupiter, the great ………………. planet. Everybody could see it clearly, night after night, as it grew and Grew and GREW. They stared up with frightened faces.
          </p>
          <p>
           Till at last it hung there in the sky over the world, blazing down, the size of the moon, a deep gloomy red. And now there could he only one explanation. The star was getting bigger because it was getting nearer. And nearer and Nearer and, NEARER.
           <br/>
           It was rushing towards the world.
           <br/>
           Faster than a bullet:
           <br/>
           Faster than any rocket.
           <br/>
           Faster even than a meteorite.
           <br/>
           And if it hit the world at that speed why, the whole world would simply be blasted to hits in the twinkling of an eye. It would be like an express train ………………. a bowl of goldfish.
          </p>
          <p>
           No wonder the people stared up with frightened faces. No wonder the astronomers watched it through their telescopes with worried frowns.

           Dear Sir
           <br/>
           I wish ________ to your notice the ridiculous product you have recently launched. I saw a TV advertisement for Dr Clean and its ability ________ ‘99 top stains’. I bought the product and ________ the least, I regret the money I spent on it. You claim that your Dr Clean stain removal keeps clothes in wearable condition for a long time and thus helps reduce clothing costs. However, let me tell you what happened when I tried ________ a stain left by tea from my shirt. ________ the stain remover on the stain does seem to make the stain fainter temporarily. But here is the problem : a little after you have sprayed Dr Clean on the fabric, the area around the stain seems to melt away. Soon, there is no stain. In fact, there is a hole where the stain was !
          </p>
          <p>
           Surely this is NOT what you meant when you advertised. The stain will no longer be visible to the naked eye ?
           <br/>

           A student has written a letter to Sagarika Sen asking for advice. Complete the letter using appropriate non-finites (- ing, – ed, and to + verb form)
          </p>
          <p>
           Dear Sagarika Sen,
          </p>
          <p>
           I am a Class XII student. My exams are a few months away and I need _________ all my time to my studies. But whenever I start _________ in the morning, a friend of mine who is in the same class comes to my house. He stays for about 30 minutes and keeps _________ all kinds of nonsense. I feel very _________ as it hampers my studies at the start of the day.
          </p>
          <p>
           Please advise me how I can ensure that he never comes to my house while I am busy for my examination. How can I ask him _________ away without hurting him ? Som Shankar Lahir Calcutta (now Kolkata)
          </p>
          <p>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           to devote, reading, talking, agitated/annoyed
           <br/>
           preparing, to keep
          </p>
          <p>
           F.5.
           <br/>
           Here is the advice that Sagarika Sen has given to Som Shankar. Complete the letter using non-finites:
          </p>
          <p>
           Dear Som Shankar,
          </p>
          <p>
           The easy way out would be _________ your servant to say that you are not at home, or that you have left strict instructions that you are not _________ at any cost. If you feel that your friend would be offended by this, then tell him that your parents do not approve of your _________ and _________ when you should be spending your time _________ Explain to him how you are getting (by your parents) because he wants _________ time with you.
          </p>
          <p>
           But please make it clear that your parents do not disapprove of him. It’s just that at the moment, they would rather you spent your time _________. Once the exams are over, he would be welcome to your house any time. But, for now, he should stay away.

           Dear Madam
          </p>
          <p>
           I request you to advise me on the worry about the coming annual examination. Every day this worry is increasing due to parental pressure etc. I am getting confused and disillusioned. This has resulted in having a serious effect on my memory. The more I read, the more I get confused and frustrated. I tend to forget what I had read a few days ! before, as the worry about the annual examination is always with me. This has also resulted in creating a secret kind of fear in me. As a result, I fail to make friends. Many a time, I fail to concentrate on my lessons. It is not that I am very weak in my studies. But I don’t feel light in my work due to one reason or the other like the holiday homework, Keeping the important things in mind becomes somewhat difficult. You may call it the ‘examination terror’.
          </p>
          <p>
           I would request you to help me fight this worry,
          </p>
          <p>
           Thanking you
           <br/>
           Yours sincerely
           <br/>
