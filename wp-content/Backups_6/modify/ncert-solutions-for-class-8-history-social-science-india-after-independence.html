           <li>
            Way back in the 1920s, the Indian National Congress, in the beginning, had promised that after independence, each major linguistic group would have its own province.
           </li>
           <li>
            After independence, the Congress did not take any steps to honour this promise.
           </li>
           <li>
            India had been divided on the basis of religion: despite the wishes and efforts of Mahatma Gandhi, freedom had come not to one nation but to two.

          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           Question 8.
           <br/>
           How was the economic development of India visualised in the early decades after Independence?
           <br/>
           Answer.
           <br/>
           In 1950, the government set up a Planning Commission to help design and execute suitable policies for economic development. There was a broad agreement on the “mixed economy’ model. Here, both the state and the private sector would play important and complementary roles in increasing production and generating jobs. Now, it was on the Planning Commission to define which industries should be initiated by the state and which by the market and how to achieve a balance between the different regions and states.
          </p>
          <p>
           In 1956, the Second Five Year Plan was formulated which focused on the development of heavy industries such as steel, and on the building of large dams. These sectors would be under the control of the state. This focus on heavy industry and the effort at state regulation of the economy was to guide economic policy for the next few decades.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Who was Mira Behn? Find out more about her life and her ideas.
           <br/>
           Answer.
           <br/>
           Mira Behn was actually Madeline’s shade, daughter of a British admiral. Mira Behn wrote in 1949, “by science and machinery the mankind may get huge returns for a time, but ultimately will come desolation. We have got to study Nature’s balance, and develop our lives within her laws if we are to survive as a physically healthy and morally decent species.” She worked with Mahatma Gandhi.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Find out more about the language divisions in Pakistan that led to the creation of the new nation of Bangladesh. How did Bangladesh achieve independence from Pakistan?
           <br/>
           Answer.
           <br/>
           After the division of India in 1947 into India and Pakistan (West and East), the Urdu speaking rulers of West Pakistan kept torturing the Bengali speaking population of East Pakistan. A time came when the East Pakistani population rose in revolt against West Pakistan. The government committed atrocities on the Bengalis and thousands of them came to India as refugees.
           <br/>
           The Bengali population formed Mukti Vahini under the leadership of Muziburr Rehman. India helped him and got the West PAKISTANI army surrendered. As a result, Bangladesh came into being on 16th December 1971.

           Question 1.
           <br/>
           What created problems in unifying the people of India after it got independence?
           <br/>
           Answer.
           <br/>
           The points that created problems were:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            At the time of independence, India’s population was large. It was divided too. There were divisions between high castes and low castes, between the majority Hindu community and Indians who practised other faiths.
           </li>
           <li>
            The citizen of this country spoke different languages, wore different kinds of dresses, ate different kinds of foods, and practiced different professions.

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           What was the label of development of India at the time it got inde¬pendence?
           <br/>
           Answer.
           <br/>
           At the time India got independence the label of its development was very low. A vast majority of Indians lived in the villages. Farmers and peasants depended on the monsoon for their survival. So did the non-farm sector of the rural economy, for if the crops failed, barbers, carpenters, weavers, and other service groups would not get paid for their services either. In the cities too the condition was not good. Factory workers usually lived in crowded slums. They had little access to education and health care.

           Question 3.
           <br/>
           What special privileges were offered for the poorest and most disadvantaged Indians by the constitution?
           <br/>
           Answer.
           <br/>
           First of all the practice of untouchability was abolished. Hindu temples were thrown open to all including the former untouchables.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            A certain percentage of seats in legislatures as well as jobs in government were reserved for members of the lowest castes.
           </li>
           <li>
            Along with the former untouchables, the Adivasis also known as the Scheduled Tribes were also granted reservations in seats and jobs. They too had been deprived and discriminated against like the Scheduled Castes.

           Question 4.
           <br/>
           How have powers and functions of the Central and State Governments been divided by the Constitution?
           <br/>
           Answer.
           <br/>
           The Indian Constitution gives the division of power in the form of three lists, known as Union List, State List, and Concurrent List. The Union List includes subjects such as taxes, defense, and foreign affairs. On these subjects, the central government makes the laws. The State List includes subjects such as education and health. It is the exclusive responsibility of the state government to take care of these subjects. In the last comes the Concurrent List which contains subjects such as forests and agriculture. On these subjects, the Centre and the States have joint responsibility.

           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Under what circumstances a compromise was made with respect to language?
           <br/>
           Answer.
           <br/>
           Several members of the Constituent Assembly believed that the English language should be driven out of India with the British rule. They were of the opinion that Hindi should take place in the English language. However, those who did not speak Hindi were of a different opinions. T.T. Krishnamachari on behalf of the people of the south strongly opposed Hindi. Some threatened to separate from India if Hindi was imposed on them. Finally, a compromise was made. It was decided that while Hindi would be the ‘official language’ of India, English would be used in the courts, the services, and communications between one state and another.

           Question 6.
           <br/>
           Under what circumstances did the new state of Andhra Pradesh come into being?
           <br/>
           Answer.
           <br/>
           The decision of the Congress leaders not to divide the country on linguistic lines disappointed the Kannada speakers, Malayalam speakers, and the Marathi speakers. They had all looked forward to having their own state. The Telugu-speaking districts of what was the Madras Presidency raised the strongest protests. In October 1952, a veteran Gandhian named Potti Sriramulu went on a hunger fast demanding the formation of Andhra state to protect the interests of Telugu-speakers. The fast went on and with it hartals and bandhs began to be observed. Meanwhile, Potti Sriramulu died. This incidence intensified the situation. The protests now became widespread and intense. This forced the Central Government to give in to demand. On 1 October 1953, the new state of Andhra Pradesh came into being.

           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Give detailed descriptions of the features of the Indian Constitution.
           <br/>
           Answer.
           <br/>
           We have a written Constitution which was adopted on 26 January 1950.
           <br/>
           Features:
           <br/>
           (a) One feature of the Indian Constitution was that it adopted a universal adult franchise. All Indians above the age of 21 (now 18) would be allowed to vote in state and national elections.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Our Constitution guaranteed equality before the law to all citizens, regardless of their caste or religious affiliation.
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) The Constitution offered special privileges for the poorest and most disadvantaged Indians. The evil practice of untouchability was abolished. Hindu temples were thrown open to all, including the former untouchables. After a long debate, the Constituent Assembly also recommended that a certain percentage of seats in legislatures as well as jobs in government be reserved for members of the lowest castes, including the Adivasis.
          </p>
          <p>
           (d) Our Constitution clearly defined the powers and functions of the central and the state governments. It gave division of power in the form of three lists – a Union List with subjects such as taxes, defense, and foreign affairs, which would be the exclusive responsibility of the Centre, a State List of subjects such as education and health, which would be taken care of mainly by the States, a Concurrent List under which would come subjects such as forests and agriculture in which the Centre and the States would have joint responsibility.

           Write in brief the process of state formation.
           <br/>
           Answer.
           <br/>
           The Congress leaders were in no mood to further divide the country into linguistic lines. This created great
           <br/>
           disappointment among the Kannada speakers, Malayalam speakers, and the Marathi speakers, and the Telugu speakers, because they had all looked forward to having their own state. The Telugu speakers, however, showed the strongest protests. Their leader Potti Sriramulu went on a hunger fast demanding the formation of Andhra state to protect the interests of Telugu speakers. As the fast went on, it attracted much Hartals and bandhs began to be observed. Meanwhile, Potti Sriramulu died. This incidence intensified the situation. The protests took intense form. This forced the Central Government to give in to the demand and the new state of Andhra Pradesh came into existence on 1 October 1953.
          </p>
          <p>
           After the formation of Andhra Pradesh, other linguistic communities also demanded their own separate states. Hence, a State Reorganisation Commission was set up, which submitted its report in 1956. It recommended the redrawing of the district and provincial boundaries to form compact provinces of Assamese, Bengali, Oriya, Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada, and Telugu speakers respectively. The large Hindi-speaking region of north India was broken up into several states. Then in 1960, the bilingual state of Bombay was divided into separate states for Marathi and Gujarati speakers. In the year 1960, the state of Punjab was also divided into Punjab and Haryana, Punjab for the Punjabi speakers, and Haryana for the rest who spoke Haryanvi or Hindi.

           Give an account of the successes and failures of the country during the sixty-two years of its independence.
           <br/>
           Answer.
           <br/>
           Sixty-two years of independence have passed. This duration covers a long journey. A lot has been achieved during this time. But at the same time, there have been a number of failures.
          </p>
          <p>
           Successes :
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            India is still united and it is still democratic. These achievements definitely make us proud. Many foreign observers had felt that India could not survive as a single country. Others believed that it would come under military rule. Neither of these predictions proved to be true. As many as thirteen general elections have been held since independence, as well as hundreds of state and local elections.
           </li>
           <li>
            There is a free press and an independent judicially.
           </li>
           <li>
            The fact that people speak different languages or practice different faiths has not come in the way of national unity.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           Failures:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Deep divisions are still there. Despite constitutional guarantees, people belonging to the lowest castes, such as Dalits face violence and discrimination. In many parts of rural India, they are not allowed access to water sources, temples, parks, and other public places.
           </li>
           <li>
            The gulf between the rich and the poor has grown over the years. Some groups of people avail all facilities while many others continue to live below the poverty line.
           </li>
           <li>
            Our Constitution provides equality before the law but in real life, this does not happen. Some Indians are more equal than others.
