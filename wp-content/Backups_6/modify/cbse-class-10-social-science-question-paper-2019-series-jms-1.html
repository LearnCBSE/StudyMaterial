           Question 11.
           <br/>
           “Water scarcity may be an outcome of large and growing population in India.” Analyse the statement. [3 × 1 = 3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Water scarcity means shortage of water. It is usually associated with regions having low rainfall or drought prone areas.
           <br/>
           There are many other reasons which lead to scarcity of water:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Large growing population means more water required for domestic use and also to produce more food.
           </li>
           <li>
            In the agricultural sector, water resources are being over-exploited to expand irrigated areas and dry-season agriculture.
           </li>
           <li>
            More water required for irrigation purposes to facilitate higher food production, i.e., for doing multiple cropping and for HYV seeds.

           Question 12.
           <br/>
           Explain the various forms that caste can take in politics. [3 × 1 = 3]
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Why has federalism succeeded in India? Which four policies adopted by India have ensured this success? [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Various forms of caste in politics:
           <br/>
           (i) When governments are formed, political parties usually take care that representatives of different castes and tribes find a place in it.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) When parties choose candidates, they keep in mind the composition of the electorate and ac rdingly choose candidates from different castes so as to muster necessary support to win elections.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Political parties make appeals to caste sentiments to gain support. Some political parties are known to favour some castes.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) Universal adult franchise and the principle of one-person-one-vote compelled political leaders to mobilise political support. It also brought new consciousness among people belonging to those castes which were treated as inferiors.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Indian Union is based on the principles of federalism. Federalism has succeeded in India due to the policies adopted by the Indian government.
           <br/>
           The four policies adopted by India which have ensured this success are:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Centre-State Relations: Federalism has been strengthened by restructuring of Centre-state relations.
           </li>
           <li>
            Decentralisation: In India, power has been decentralised to the local government which includes Panchayats and Municipalities.
           </li>
           <li>
            Linguistic States: The policy of creating linguistic states has also strengthened federalism. This policy united the nation despite of the diversities.
           </li>
           <li>
            Language Policy: Indian federation did not give status of national language to any one language. This has strengthened federalism to a large extent.
           </li>
          </ul>

           Question 13.
           <br/>
           ” Women still lag much behind men in India despite some improvements since independence.” Analyse the statement. [1 × 3 = 3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A lot has been done to bring women at par with men but still women face disadvantages, discriminations and oppression in various ways.
           <br/>
           (i) The literacy rate among women is only 54 per cent compared with 76 percent among men. Similarly, a smaller proportion of girl students go for higher studies. Many of them drop out because parents prefer to spend their resources for their boys’ education.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The proportion of women among the highly paid and valued jobs is still very small. On an average an Indian woman works one hour more than an average man every day. Yet much of her work is not paid and therefore often not valued.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) The Equal Wages Act provides that equal wages should be paid to equal work. However, in almost all areas of work, from sports and cinema, to factories and fields, women are paid less than men, even when both do exactly the same work.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) In many parts of India parents prefer to have sons and find ways to have the girl child aborted before she is born. Such sex-selective abortion led to a decline in child sex ratio.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) Women are not safe even within their own home from beating, harassment and other forms of domestic violence.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 14.
           <br/>
           How are political parties recognized as regional and national parties in India? Explain – with examples. [1 × 3 = 3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Political parties as regional party. A regional party is a party that is present in only some ‘ states. Regional parties or State parties need not be regional in their ideology. They have
           <br/>
           state identity as they are present only in some states. Some of these parties are all India parties that happen to have succeeded only in states.
           <br/>
           For Example, Samajwadi Party, Rashtriya Janta Dal, Trinamool Congress, Shiv Sena, etc. Conditions required for a party to be recognized as a regional political party:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            A party that secures at least six percent of the total votes in an election to the S legislative assembly of a state.
           </li>
           <li>
            Wins at least two seats in the legislative assembly.
            <br/>
            Political parties as national party. National political parties have their units in various states. By and large all these units follow the same policies, programmes and strategy that is decided at the national level.
            <br/>
            For Example, BJP, Indian National Congress.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Conditions required to be a national political party:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            A party that secures at least 6% of the total votes in general elections of Lok Sabha or assembly elections in four states.
           </li>
           <li>
            A party that wins at least 4 seats in the Lok Sabha.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Question 15.
           <br/>
           “Consequences of environmental degradation do not respect national or state boundaries.” Justify the statement. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Environment is degraded though the depletion of resources like air, water and soil. It leads to destruction of ecosystem and extinction of wildlife. It is now a global issue and has been debated over decades.
           <br/>
           Environmental degradation is not restricted to the nation or state boundaries. It’s consequences have been felt in the surrounding states and neighbouring countries and sometimes globally.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Pollution in one country may affect the other in the form of acid rain, climate change.
           </li>
           <li>
            Deforestation in some countries may disturb the rainfall pattern in the surrounding countries for e.g., deforestation in Brazil has caused disturbance in rainfall pattern in South America.
           </li>
           <li>
            Land degradation and dam bursts can bring massive siltation and flood like situation.
           </li>
           <li>
            National calamities such as global warming, ozone layer depletion etc. cannot be controlled by a single nation and hence are to be discussed by all the countries.
           </li>
           <li>
            Pollution of rivers in a country like India affects all as the rivers cross state boundaries and pass through different states.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Question 16.
           <br/>
           Why is the ‘tertiary sector’ becoming important in India? Explain any three reasons. [3]
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           How do we count various goods and services for calculating Gross Domestic Product (G.t?.’P.) of a country? Explain with example. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Tertiary sector or service sector plays a very significant role and its importance is rising day by day:
           <br/>
           (i) Greater the development of primary sector and secondary sector more would be the demand for Services.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Tertiary sector has become the largest producer in India because various kinds of services such as hospitals, educational institutions, post and telegraph services, police stations, courts, village administrative offices, transport, banks, insurance companies etc. are required.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Even development of agriculture and industry leads to the development of services such as transport, trade and storage etc.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) With the rise in income, demand for more services is rising.
           <br/>
           For example, eating out in restaurants, tourism, malls and shopping complexes, schools, professional training.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) New services like Information Technology and outsourcing have become very important for modern day trade and industry. Unfortunately, the rapid growth of the service sector in India has not yet shown the expected corresponding increase in employment.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is the final value of total produce in a given year of the Primary, Secondary and Tertiary (Service) sectors minus the raw materials (like jute, cofton) and intermediate goods (like motor parts produced for car industry). This is to avoid double counting. CSO (Central Statistical Organisation) of Government of India fulfils the task of measuring GDP in India.
           <br/>
           GDP can be measured in three ways:
           <br/>
           (i) We can count the value of what has been produced in the country in a given year, not counting either raw materials or intermediate goods used in domestic production (this is to avoid double counting).
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Similarly, if we add the incomes earned in a given year in production, we will get the income measure of GDP.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) In the same way we can get the GDP by counting all the payments made in the year. If there are no mistakes made in the three ways of counting, each will give the same value of GDP.
          </p>

           Question 17.
           <br/>
           Describe the importance of formal sources of credit in the economic development. [1 × 3 = 3]
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Describe the bad effects of informal sources of credit on borrowers. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Importance of formal sources of credit in the Economic Development:
           <br/>
           (i) Supervision. The formal sources work under the supervision of the RBI. The RBI monitors that the banks actually maintain cash balance and give loans to small cultivators and farmers too.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Lower rate of interest. The rate of interest of the formal sector is decided by the RBI. So normally, the interest rates are very low.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Cheap credit. Formal sources provide cheap credit. Credit at affordable rate is available through formal sources. Terms and conditions of credit through formal sources are regulated by government.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           The credit activities of the informal sector should be discouraged because:
           <br/>
           (i) 85% of loans taken by the poor households in the urban areas are from informal sources. There is no organisation that supervises the credit activities of lenders in the informal sector.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Informal lenders charge very high interest on their loans. They try to charge more and more interest on their loans as there are no boundaries and restrictions.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Higher cost of borrowing means a larger part of the earnings of the borrowers is used to repay the loan.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) In certain cases, the high interest rate for borrowing can mean that the amount to be repaid is greater than the income of borrower. This could lead to increasing debt and debt trap, therefore the credit activities of the informal sector should be discouraged.

           Question 18.
           <br/>
           What are public facilities? Which better public facilities are needed for the development of the country? Explain any four public facilities. [3 × 1 = 3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Public facilities are the facilities provided by the government either free of cost or at a very low price for the welfare of the people like schools, health centres, public transport etc. Four major public facilities are:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Basic Education. Government provides schools and other educational facilities like chairs, books etc. to be used by the public.
           </li>
           <li>
            Basic Health Facilities. Government provides hospitals and vaccine programmes to maintain proper health of public.
           </li>
           <li>
            Law and order Facility. It is the duty of the government to ensure law and order and provide security in order to maintain peace in the country.
           </li>
           <li>
            Public Distribution System (PDS). Government has opened PDS shops or Ration shops to supply basic food items like rice, wheat, pulses etc. at very low price to the lower income groups or poor people.

           Define the term ‘Civil Disobedience Movement.’ Describe the participation of rich and poor peasant communities in the ‘Civil Disobedience Movement.’ [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Poona Pact:
           <br/>
           (i) Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, who organised the dalits into the Depressed Classes Association in’ 1930 demanded separate electorates for dalits in the Second Round Table Conference organised in London.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) When British accepted this demand in the name of Communal Award, Gandhiji started a fast unto death. He believed that separate electorates for dalits would slow down the process of their integration into the society.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Ambedkar and Gandhi came to an agreement with Ambedkar accepting Gandhis position and the result was the Poona Pact of September, 1932.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            It gave the depressed classes (later to be known as Schedule castes) reserved seats in provincial and central legislative councils.
           </li>
           <li>
            But, they were to be voted in by the general electorate.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Or
           <br/>
           The Civil Disobedience Movement was a movement to disobey the rules of the British Government.
           <br/>
           (i) Rich peasant communities, like the Patidars of Gujarat and the Jats of Uttar Pradesh, became active in the Civil Disobedience Movement. Being producers of commercial crops, they were hard hit by trade-depression and falling prices.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) As their cash income reduced, they found it impossible to pay the government’s revenue demand. These rich peasants became ardent supporters of the Civil Dis-obedience Movement. For them fight for Swaraj was a struggle against high revenues.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Small tenants had been cultivating rented land of landlords. They were not interested in the lowering of the revenue demand. As the economic depression continued, small farmers found it difficult to pay their rent. The poor peasants participated as they wanted their unpaid rent to be remitted.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) Congress was unwilling to support ‘No rent campaign’, as they did not want to upset the rich peasants and landlords. They often joined the radical movements led by the socialists and communists.

           “Series of changes affected the pattern of industrialization in India by the early twentieth century.” Analyze the statement. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Foodgrain and raw material exports from India to Britain and the rest of the world increased. The value of British exports to India was much higher than the value of British imports from India. Thus Britain had a ‘trade surplus’ with India. By helping Britain balance its deficits with other countries, India played a crucial role in the late nineteenth century world economy. Britain’s trade surplus with India also helped to pay the so-called ‘home charges’ that included private remittances home by British officials and traders, interest payments on India’s external debts and pensions of British officials in India.

          </p>
          <ul>

            As the Swadeshi Movement gathered momentum, nationalists wanted Indians to boycott foreign cloth.
           </li>
           <li>
            Industrial groups organized themselves to protect their collective interests, pressuring the Government to increase tariff protection and grant other concessions.
           </li>
           <li>
            From 1906, the export of Indian yarn to China declined, since produce from Chinese and Japanese mills flooded the Chinese markets.
           </li>
           <li>

           Answer:
           <br/>
           Industries are responsible for environmental degradation in India in the following ways:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Pollution of land, water and air from industries causes environmental degradation.
           </li>
           <li>
            Burning of fossil fuels in big and small factories emits smoke in the air.
           </li>
           <li>
            Organic and inorganic industrial wastes and effluents are discharged into rivers.
           </li>
           <li>
            Dumping of wastes from industries renders the soil useless.
           </li>
           <li>
            Rain water carrying pollutants from wastes dumped by industries percolates and contaminates the ground water.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Roadways score over railways:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Construction of roads is easier and cheaper as compared to railways.
           </li>
           <li>
            Roads provide door to door service, thus the cost of loading and unloading is much lower as compared to railways which generally leave the people and goods at the destined railway stations.
           </li>
           <li>
            Roads can negotiate higher gradients of slope and, as such, can traverse through mountainous terrain. But railways cannot negotiate steep gradients.
           </li>
           <li>
            Road transport is economical in transportation of few persons and relatively smaller amount of goods over short distances.
           </li>
           <li>
            Road transport is also used as a feeder to other modes of transport. They provide links between railway stations, airports and sea ports.
           </li>
           <li>
            They link agricultural farms with markets and industries, thus linking rural and urban areas.
           </li>
          </ul>

           <br/>
           How has the idea of power sharing emerged? Explain different forms that have common arrangements of power sharing. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Comparison of Belgium and Sri Lanka:
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) Belgium is located in Europe whereas Sri Lanka is located in South Asia.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Belgium has a population of little over one crore whereas Sri Lanka has a population of two crores.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) In Belgium, 59 percent people live in Flemish region and speak the Dutch language, 40 percent people live in Wallonia region and speak French and remaining 1 percent Belgian people speak German. On the other hand, in Sri Lanka 74 percent of the population are Sinhalese speakers and 18 percent are Tamil speakers.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) In Belgium, French-speaking community are relatively rich and powerful and in Sri Lanka, Sinhalese-speaking people are Buddhist and powerful.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) In Belgium, Dutch speaking people are in numeric majority whereas in Sri Lanka, Sinhalese speaking population are in majority.
           <br/>
           Or,
           <br/>
           It was believed for a long time that all power of a government must vest in one person or a group of persons located at one place to take quick decisions and enforce them. These notions have changed with the emergence of democracy because the principle of democracy is that people are the source of all political power. Therefore, with the emergence of democracy, it was felt that power should be distributed among as many citizens as possible. Power sharing has also emerged in opposition to the notion of undivided political power.
          </p>
          <p>
           Forms of power-sharing:
           <br/>
           (i) Power is shared among different organs of government, such as the legislature, executive and judiciary. This is horizontal distribution of power because it allows different organs of government, placed at the same level to exercise different powers. A system of checks and balances ensures that in such a distribution none
           <br/>
           of the organs can exercise unlimited powers. Example: In India the judiciary has an independent status. The Supreme Court is the apex court of justice. The Parliament is the legislative body and the Executive is the implementing body.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Power can be shared among governments at different levels — a general government for the entire country and governments at provincial or regional level. This is the A federal form of government. The Constitution clearly lays down the powers of ’. different levels of government. This federal division of power involving higher and lower levels of government is also called the vertical division of power.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Power may also be shared among different social groups, such as religious and linguistic groups. Example: ‘Community government’ in Belgium is a good example of this arrangement. The government is elected by people belonging to one language community —Dutch, French and German speaking, no matter where they live.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) Power-sharing arrangement can also be seen in the way political parties, pressure groups and movements control or influence those in power. In contemporary democracies, this takes the form of competition among different parties who form alliances to contest elections. Example: In India, there were three major alliances in 2004 parliamentary elections — the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) and the Left Front.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) In India, there is also a three-fold distribution of legislative powers divided between the centre and state in the form of Union List, State List and Concurrent List. Residuary subjects are legislated by centre.

           Question 24.
           <br/>
           Describe the importance of democratic government as an accountable and legitimate government. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A democracy is concerned with ensuring that people have the right to choose their rulers
           <br/>
           and have control over the rulers:
           <br/>
           (i) Whenever possible and necessary, citizens should be able to participate in decision¬making in a democracy.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Democracy ensures that decision-making is based on norms and procedures. A citizen has the right and the means to examine the process of decision-making. Thus democracy entails transparency.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) A democracy helps to produce an accountable, responsive and legitimate govern¬ment, by ensuring—
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Regular, free and fair elections;
           </li>
           <li>
            Open public debate on major policies and legislations;
           </li>
           <li>
            Citizens’ right to be informed about government policies; and
           </li>
           <li>
            A government free from corruption.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (iv) Democratic government is a legitimate government. It may be slow, less efficient, not always very responsive or clean. But a democratic govefnment is peoples’ own government. As a result, people believe that democracy is suitable for their country as it is a legitimate government. Democracy’s ability to generate its own support is itself an outcome that cannot be ignored.

           Question 25.
           <br/>
           Why do multinational corporations (MNCs) set up their offices and factories in certain areas only? Explain any five reasons.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) MNCs set up offices and factories for production in regions where they can get cheap labour and other resources. Example, Countries like China, Bangladesh and India. They also provide with the advantage of cheap manufacturing locations.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) MNCs also need close-by markets for the goods that they manufacture. Mexico and Eastern Europe are useful for their closeness to the markets in the US and Europe.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Besides these, MNCs also require skilled engineers and IT personnel and a large number of English speaking people who are able to provide customer care services (India possibly tops in this area).
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) MNCs also set up factories in areas where raw material is easily available and other factors of production like electricity, etc. is assured.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) MNCs set up their offices in places where government policies are favourable to the investors.

           Question 14.
           <br/>
           Explain the three components of ‘political party.’ [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Political party is a group of people who come together to contest elections and to hold power in the government. They agree on some policies to promote collective good. They seek to implement those policies by winning popular support through elections. Thus political parties tend to fill political offices and exercise political power.
           <br/>
           Components of a political party are:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The leaders,
           </li>
           <li>
            active members and
           </li>
           <li>
            the followers.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (i) The leaders are recruited and trained by parties. They are made ministers to run the government. The big policy decisions are taken by the political executives that come from the political parties.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Parties have lakhs of members and activists spread over the country. Many of the * pressure groups are the extensions of political parties among different sections of society. But since most of the members belong to a party, they go by the direction of ‘ the party leadership, irrespective of their personal opinion.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) The followers are the ordinary citizens, who believe in the policies of their respective party and give popular support through elections. Often the opinions of the followers crystallise on the lines parties take.

           Question 21.
           <br/>
           Explain with examples any five factors that are responsible for industrial location. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Factors responsible for Industrial Locations:
           <br/>
           (i) Raw material. Cheap and abundant availability of raw material. Industries which use heavy and perishable raw material have to be located close to the source of raw material.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Labour. Availability of cheap labour —both skilled and unskilled, is necessary for keeping the cost of production low.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Power. Cheap and continuous supply of power is extremely necessary for continuity in the production process.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) Capital. It is necessary for developing infrastructure, for the entire manufacturing process and for meeting manufacturing expenditure.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) Banking and insurance facilities, favourable government policies are other factors which affect location of an industry.
           <br/>
           The ‘key’ to the decision of a factory location is least cost so that the venture is profitable.
          </p>

           Question 24.
           <br/>
           Describe any five outcomes of democracy. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           There are certain things that democracy must provide:
           <br/>
           (i) In a democracy people have the right to choose their rulers and people will have control over them. Whenever possible and necessary, citizens should be able to participate in decision-making, that affects them all.
           <br/>
           Thus the most basic outcome of democracy is that it produces a government that is accountable to the citizens and is responsive to their needs and expectations.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) It is right to expect democracy to produce a government that follows procedures and is accountable to people. To do so, the democratic government develops mechanisms for citizens—regular, free and fair elections, open public debate on major policies and legislations, and citizens’ right to information about the government and its functioning.
           <br/>
           Thus people wish to be ruled by the representatives elected by them. Therefore, democracy’s ability to generate its own support is itself an outcome that cannot be ignored.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Democracy helps to accommodate social divisions and diversity. No society can fully and permanently resolve conflict among different groups. But we can learn to respect these differences and evolve mechanisms to negotiate them. Belgium is a successful example of negotiating differences among ethnic population.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) Passion for dignity, respect and freedom of the citizens is the basis of democracy and has been achieved in various degrees in various democracies.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) Democracy provides equal status and opportunities for all.
          </p>
          <p>
           (vi) It can be used for storing drinking water.

           Question 25.
           <br/>
           Explain any five effects of globalization. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Globalization has had both a positive as well as a negative effect:
           <br/>
           1. People with education, skill and wealth have benefitted by globalization.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Greater competition among producers (both local and foreign) has been advan-tageous to consumers, particularly the well-off section. Rich people enjoy improved quality at lower prices for several products and enjoy a higher standard of living.
           </li>
           <li>
            MNCs have increased their investments in India over the past 20 years in industries / such as cell phones, automobiles, electronics, soft drinks, fast food and services such as banking.
           </li>
           <li>
            New jobs have been created in all these industries and services.
           </li>
           <li>
            Top Indian companies have benefitted from the increased competition. They have invested in newer technology and production methods.
           </li>
           <li>
            Some Indian companies have gained from successful collaborations with foreign companies. Globalization has enabled some companies to emerge as multinationals.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           2. However, globalization has not been uniform among producers and workers.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            (i) Globalization has posed a major challenge for a large number of small producers and workers. Small manufacturers have been hit hard due to competition causing many industrial units to shut down, rendering many workers jobless in small industries,
           </li>
           <li>
            Due to the pressure of competition, most employers do not employ workers on a permanent basis; to avoid paying for the whole year.
           </li>
           <li>
            Workers’ jobs are not secure any more, wages are low and they are forced to work overtime to earn adequate money.
           </li>
           <li>
            In order to cut costs of products for the benefit of MNCs, employers in industries such as garment exports, pay very low wages to workers.
           </li>
          </ul>

           Question 11.
           <br/>
           Analyse the impact of ‘water scarcity.’ [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Water scarcity means shortage of water. It is usually associated with regions having low rainfall or drought prone areas. Impact of ‘water scarcity’ is the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Pumping out more water from under the ground may lead to falling ground water levels.
           </li>
           <li>
            It will adversely affect water availability.
           </li>
           <li>
            This, in turn, will affect our agriculture and food security of the people.
           </li>
           <li>
            Impoverishment of water resources may adversely affect the ecological cycle.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Question 14.
           <br/>
           Explain any three functions of opposition political parties. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Opposition parties play an important role in democracies. They play both positive and negative role.
           <br/>
           Positive role,
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            They ensure that the political party in power does not misuse or abuse its power;
           </li>
           <li>
            They expose the weaknesses of the ruling party;
           </li>
           <li>
            They also keep a close vigil on the bills and expenditure of the government.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Negative role,
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            They target the government and aim at dislodging and discrediting the government for all the ills and the troubles the people face;
           </li>
           <li>
            Through stalling the proceedings of the parliament, dharnas and gheravs, it curtails the progress of the country. The opposition’s work is not to abstract the functioning of the administration but keep a close watch on the working of the party in power so that democracy becomes meaningful.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Question 21.
           <br/>
           Explain five types of ‘industrial pollution.’ [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The five types of industrial pollution are –
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Air pollution;
           </li>
           <li>
            Water pollution;
           </li>
           <li>
            Land pollution;
           </li>
           <li>
            Noise pollution and
           </li>
           <li>
            Thermal pollution.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (i) Air pollution. Smoke is emitted by chemical and paper factories, brick kilns, refineries and smelting plants, and burning of fossil fuels in factories that ignore pollution norms. Air-borne particulate materials contain both solid and liquid particles like dust, sprays, mist and smoke.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Water pollution. Major water pollutants are dyes, detergents, acids and salts. Heavy metals like lead and mercury, pesticides and fertilizers and synthetic chemicals with carbon, plastics and rubber etc. discharged in the water bodies without treatment t pollute these water bodies.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Noise pollution. The generators, compressors, machines, furnaces, looms, exhaust fans, etc. used by industries create a lot of noise. Noise can raise blood pressure and can have physiological effects as well.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) Land pollution. Land and water pollution are closely related. Dumping of industrial wastes especially glass, harmful chemicals, industrial effluents, packing, salts and garbage renders the soil useless.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) Thermal pollution. Wastes from nuclear power plants, nuclear and weapon production facilities cause cancer and birth defects.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 24.
           <br/>
           Describe any five factors that make democracy a better form of government than other alternatives. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Gandhiji said, “Religion can never be separated from politics”. By religion he did not mean any particular religion like Hinduism or Islam, but moral values and ethics drawn from religion to guide politics. Religion in politics is not as dangerous as it may seem to us. Ethical values of each religion can play a major role in politics. According to human rights groups, most of the victims of communal riots in our country are from religious minorities. Government can take special steps to protect them. Family laws of all religions discriminate against women.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government can change laws to make them more equitable. These instances show a relationship between religion and politics. People should be able to express in politics their needs, interests and demands as members of a religious community. Thus, it is the responsibility of those whose political power is able to regulate the practice of religion, to prevent discrimination and oppression. These political acts are not wrong as long as they treat every religion equally.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 25.
           <br/>
           Explain any five facilities available in the special economic zones developed by the Central and State Governments to attract foreign investment. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Facilities available in the special economic zones developed by the Central and State governments:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Special Economic Zones (SEZs) are to have World Class Facilities such as electricity, water, roads, transport etc.
           </li>
           <li>
            Government also provides recreational and educational facilities.
           </li>
           <li>
            Companies who set up production units in the SEZs are exempted from taxes for an initial period of five years.
           </li>
           <li>
            Government has allowed flexibility in labour laws to attract foreign investment.
           </li>
           <li>
            Instead of hiring workers on a regular basis, companies hire workers flexibly for short periods when there is intense pressure of work. Thus, SEZs help to attract foreign companies to invest in India.
           </li>
          </ul>
