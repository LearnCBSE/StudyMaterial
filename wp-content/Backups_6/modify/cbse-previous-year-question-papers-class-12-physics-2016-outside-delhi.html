           Question 2.
           <br/>
           In what way is the behavior of a diamagnetic material different from that of a para magnetic, when kept in an external magnetic field ? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The magnetic field lines pass through the para magnetic material while the magnetic field lines move away from the diamagnetic material, or para magnetic material get aligned along B and dianegnetic aliqied perpendicular to B.

           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           Sun appears red at sunrise and sunset due to the least scattering of red light as it has the longest wavelength.

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           A battery of emf 12 V and internal resistance 2 Ω is connected to a 4 Ω resistor as shown in the figure. [2]
           <br/>
           (a) Show that a voltmeter when placed across the cell and across the resistor, in turn, gives the same reading.
           <br/>
           (b) To record the voltage and the current in the circuit, why is voltmeter placed in parallel and ammeter in series in the circuit ?
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 Physics 2016 Outside Delhi 9" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-127204" height="206" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Physics-2016-Outside-Delhi-9.png" width="223"/>

           <img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 Physics 2016 Outside Delhi 10" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-127205" height="207" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 358px) 100vw, 358px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Physics-2016-Outside-Delhi-10.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Physics-2016-Outside-Delhi-10.png 358w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Physics-2016-Outside-Delhi-10-300x173.png 300w" width="358"/>
           <br/>
           So, a voltmeter when placed across the cell and across the resistor, gives the same reading,
           <br/>
           (b) An ammeter is connected in series because it has very low resistance. So, when, an ammeter is connected in series, then there is not much increase in the resistance of the circuit and hence the current through the circuit unchanged.
           <br/>
           A voltmeter is connected in parallel because it has very high resistance. So, it draws a very small current from the circuit.

           The electric field due to single charge is not constant, this is the reason why the equipotential surfaces about a single charge are not equidistant and potential vary

           inversely with radius i.e., V × 1/r
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) No, electric field cannot exist tangential to an equipotential surface. If it happen then a charged particle will experience a force along the tangential line and can move along it. As a charged particle can move only due to the potential difference i.e., along the direction of charge of potential, this contradicts the concept of an equipotential surface.

           (i) State law of Malus.
           <br/>
           (ii) Draw a graph showing the variation of intensity (I) of polarised light transmitted by an analyser with angle (θ) between polariser and analyser.

           (i) Malus discovered that when a beam of completely plane polarized light is passed through the analyser, the intensity T of transmitted light changes directly as the square of the cosine of the angle 0 between the transmission directions of polarizer and analyzer. This is known as the law of Malus.

           Therefore, threshold frequency for metal B is less than the threshold frequency for metal A. Hence, stopping potential is more for metal B.

           (ii) No, the slope of the graph tells us the value of h/e which is same for both the materials. So, it does not depend on the nature of the materials.

           This is the required relation.
           <br/>
           (ii) The drift velocity of free electrons in a metallic conductor decreases with increase in temperature, because, if we increase the temperature of the metallic conductor the collision between the electrons and ions increases, which decreases relaxation time. Hence, drift velocity decreases.

           <img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 Physics 2016 Outside Delhi 19" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-127214" height="115" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Physics-2016-Outside-Delhi-19.png" width="287"/>
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) The average power supplied by the source over a complete cycle is
           <br/>
           \(\mathrm{P}_{a v}=\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{rms}} \mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{rms}} \cdot \cos \phi\)
          </p>
          <p>
           When the circuit contains an ideal inductor, then the phase difference between the current and voltage is π/2.
           <br/>
           So, \(\phi=\pi / 2 . \text { So, } \cos \phi=\cos \pi / 2=0\)
           <br/>
           Hence  \(\mathrm{P}_{a v}=0\)
           <br/>
           So, when an ac source is connected to an ideal inductor, the average power supplied by the source over a complete cycle is zero.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The brightness of the lamp will decrease. When the key is plugged in and the iron rod is inserted inside the inductor, it increases the inductance. Hence, the reactance of the inductor (X
           <sub>
            L
           </sub>
           = ωL) increases. So, the impedance of the circuit (Z = R + jωL) increases, which decreases the current in the circuit.

           Question 17.

           (i) Explain with the help of a diagram the formation of depletion region and barrier potential in a p-n junction.
           <br/>
           (ii) Draw the circuit diagram of a half wave rectifier and explain its working. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           (i) During the formation of p-n junction, the holes diffuse from p-type semiconductor to the n-type, and electrons diffuse from n-type to p-type. This is because of the concentration gradient across p-side and n-side.
           <br/>

           <br/>
           When a hole diffuse from p to n type, it leaves an unmovable negative charge. Similarly, when an electron diffuses from n to p type, it leaves an unmovable positive charge. When the diffusion of holes and electrons takes place continuously across the junction, a layer of unmovable positive and negative charges are developed on either side of the junction. This layer is called the depletion layer or the depletion region and the potential difference across the region is called barrier potential.
          </p>

           <br/>
           Working: When an input ac voltage is applied across the primary coil, a potential difference is developed across the ends of the secondary coil. Consider that in half cycle of input ac signal, the end A acts as the +ve end and B acts as the -ve end of the battery. So, the diode is in forward bias and we get output across the ends of the load resistance R
           <sub>
            L
           </sub>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           In the second half cycle, ends A and B reverse in polarity. Now, A acts as the -ve end and B acts as the +ve end. So, the diode D is in reverse bias and no output is obtained due to the high resistance offered by the diode.
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 Physics 2016 Outside Delhi 22" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-127217" height="171" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Physics-2016-Outside-Delhi-22.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Physics-2016-Outside-Delhi-22.png 313w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Physics-2016-Outside-Delhi-22-300x164.png 300w" width="313"/>
           <br/>
           So, in this process, we get output alternately, and hence the diode is called the half wave rectifier.

           <br/>
           (ii) During the charging and discharging of a capacitor, a flow of charges take place from the battery to the plates of the capacitor. This produces a conduction current in the circuit and a displacement current between plates. Hence the galvanometer shows a momentary deflection.

           (ii) When light travels from a rarer to a denser medium, the speed decreases. Does this decrease in speed imply a reduction in the energy carried by the wave ?

           (iii) In the wave picture of light, intensity of light is determined by the square of the amplitude of the wave. What determines the intensity in the photon picture of light ?
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           Wave front: A wave front is the locus of all the points in space that reach a particular distance by a propagating wave in same phase at any instant.
           <br/>
           Huygens’s principle : It is based on two assumptions :
           <br/>
           (a) Each point of the wave front behaves like a source of secondary disturbances and secondary wavelets from there points spread out in all directions with the same speed as that of the original wave front.
           <br/>
           (b) When we draw an envelope in the forward direction of the secondary disturbances at any instant, And this envelope tells the new position of the wave front at that instant.

           <br/>
           (i) Both the reflection and refraction takes place due to the interaction of light with the atoms at the surface of the separation. Light incident on these atoms, force them to vibrate with the frequency of light. But, the light emitted by these charged atoms is equal to their own frequency of oscillation. So, both the reflected and refracted lights have same frequency, hence frequency remains changed.
           <br/>
           (ii) The energy carried by a wave depends on the amplitude of the wave. It does not depend on the speed of the wave propagation. Hence the energy of the wave remains same and does not decrease.
           <br/>
           (iii) The intensity of light is determined by the number of photons incident per unit area around the point at which intensity is to be determined.

           Question 23.
           <br/>
           Ram is a student of class x in a village school. His uncle gifted him a bicycle with a dynamo fitted in it. He was very excited to get it. While cycling during night, he could light the bulb and see the objects on the road. He, however, did not know how this device works. He asked this question to his teacher. The teacher considered it an opportunity to explain the working to the whole class.
           <br/>
           Answer the following questions : [4]
           <br/>
           (a) State the principle and working of a dynamo.
           <br/>
           (b) Write two values each displayed by Ram and his school teacher.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) A dynamo works on the principle of electromagnetic induction. A dynamo includes a coil attached to a small turbine fitted with a plastic cap. The coil is placed in a magnetic field. When the plastic cap comes in contact with moving tyres of the bicycle, the coil placed between the poles of a magnet rotates, thus, the flux through the coil changes continuously. This induces a current in the coil which is connected to a bulb which lights up. As long as the bicycle is moving, the coil keeps on rotating, and hence, the flux keeps on changing. At a steady rate, we get a steady current and hence a light of steady intensity is obtained.

           <br/>
           Principle : A transformer works on the principle of mutual induction. Whenever the amount of magnetic flux linked with a coil changes, an emf is induced in the neighboring coil.
          </p>
          <p>
           Working: When an alternating current source is connected to the ends of primary coil, the current changes continuously in the primary coil, due to which magnetic flux linked with the secondary coil changes continuously. Therefore, the alternating emf of same frequency is developed across the secondary terminals. According to Faraday’s laws the e.m.f. induced in the primary coil,

           Magnifying power : The magnifying power of a refracting type astronomical telescope is defined as the ratio of angle subtended by the final image at eye to the angle subtended by the object at eye.
           <br/>
           (b) (i) We know that,
           <br/>
           \(\text { Magnification, } m=\frac{f_{o}}{f_{e}}=\frac{P_{e}}{P_{o}}\)
          </p>
          <p>
           Therefore, the lens of 0.5 D should be used as objective and the lens of 10 D should be used as eye-piece in order to achieve higher magnification.
           <br/>
           (ii) The aperture of the objective lens is made larger so, that it receives as much light as coming from the distant object and the resolving power of the telescope increases.

           Consider a thin infinite uniformly charged plane sheet having the surface charge density of a. The electric field is normally outward to the plane sheet and is same in magnitude but opposite in direction. Now, draw a Gaussian surface in the form of cylinder around an axis. Let its cross-sectional area be A. The cylinder is made from three surfaces A, S
           <sub>
            2

           , and A and the electric flux linked with S
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           is 0. So, the total electric flux linked through the Gaussian surface is
