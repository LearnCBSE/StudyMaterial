         <p>
          Question 1.
          <br/>
          Name the pattern of inheritance where F
          <sub>
           1
          </sub>
          phenotype
          <br/>
          (i) resembles only one of the two parents.
          <br/>
          (ii) does not resemble either of the two parents and is in between the two. (All India 2019)
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          Name the respective pattern of inheritance, where F
          <sub>
           1
          </sub>
          phenotype
          <br/>
          (i) does not resemble either of the two parents and is in between the two.
          <br/>
          (ii) resembles only one of the two parents. (All India 2012)
          <br/>

         <p>
          Question 2.
          <br/>
          British geneticist RC Punnett developed a graphical representation of a genetic cross called ‘Punnett Square’. Mention the possible result this representation predicts of the genetic cross carried. (Delhi 2019)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Punnett square helps to predict the probability of all the possible genotypes of offspring in a genetic cross.
         </p>
         <p>
          Question 3.
          <br/>
          Name the type of cross that would help to find the genotype of a pea plant bearing violet flowers. (All India 2017)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          To find the genotype of a pea plant bearing violet flowers, test cross would be carried out in which the plant with dominant trait, i.e. violet flowers, will be crossed with its recessive parent.
         </p>
         <p>
          Question 4.
          <br/>
          State a difference between a gene and an allele. (All India 2016)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          A unit of inheritance which is passed down from parent to offspring through the gametes over successive generations is known as gene. Genes consist of a pair of contrasting forms for a character that are known as alleles.

         <p>
          Question 5.
          <br/>
          Give an example of polygenic trait in humans. (Delhi 2016C)
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          On what basis is the skin colour in humans considered polygenic? (Delhi 2016)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          An example of a polygenic trait in humans is skin colour.
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          Skin colour is considered to be a polygenic trait because it is under the control of many genes.
         </p>
         <p>
          Question 6.
          <br/>
          A geneticist interested in studying variations and patterns of inheritance in living beings prefers to choose organisms for experiments with shorter life cycle. Provide a reason. (Delhi 2015)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          A geneticist interested in studying variations and patterns of inheritance in living beings prefers to choose organisms with shorter life cycle, because it enables the geneticist to study many generations of the organism in a short time period.

          Explain pleiotropy with the help of an example. (Foreign 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Pleiotropy is the phenomenon in which a single gene exhibits multiple phenotypic expressions. The genes exhibiting pleiotropy are called pleiotrppic genes. Pleiotropism occurs mainly because of mutation in a particular gene, e.g. phenylketonuria which is a disorder caused by mutation in the gene coding for the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. In the absence of this enzyme, phenylalanine is not converted into tyrosine and accumulation of phenylalanine takes place. The affected individual shows hair and skin pigmentation and mental problems.

          Question 25.
          <br/>
          With the help of one example, explain the phenomena of codominance and multiple allelism in human population. (All India 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          In human population, the phenomena of codominance and multiple allelism can be explained by the inheritance pattern of ABO blood groups which are controlled by three alleles, i.e. I
          <sup>
           A
          </sup>
          ,I
          <sup>

          and I.
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Codominance I
           <sup>
            A
           </sup>
           and I
           <sup>
            B
           </sup>
           both are codominant as both of them express themselves independently in blood group AB (I
           <sup>
            A
           </sup>
           I
           <sup>
            B
           </sup>
           ). There is no mixing of the effects of two alleles and the expressed phenotype is the combination of two phenotypes. They do not follow Mendelian inheritance.
          </li>
          <li>
           Multiple allelism In this phenomenon, genes exist in more than two allelic forms or combinations. For example, the gene for blood group exists in three allelic forms I
           <sup>
            A
           </sup>
           , I
           <sup>
            B
           </sup>
           and i. These alleles are produced due to repeated mutation of the same gene in different direction. They do not follow Mendelian pattern of inheritance.
          </li>
         </ul>

          Question 26.
          <br/>
          Linkage and crossing over of genes are alternatives of each other. Justify with the help of an example. (All India 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Linkage is the tendency of certain loci or alleles (genes) to be inherited together. While crossing over in the segregation of genes. The former helps to preserve parental characters in offsprings whearas the latter produces new combination of characters. The genes on a chromosome either follow linkage path or crossing over to form the gametes during gametogenesis in human. Therefore, linkage and crossing over of genes are alternatives of each other.

          Question 29.
          <br/>
          How does the gene T control ABO blood group in humans? Write the effect the gene has on the structure of red blood cells. (Delhi 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          In humans, the ABO blood groups are controlled by a gene called gene ‘I’. It has three alleles, i.e. I
          <sup>
           A
          </sup>
          , I
          <sup>
           B
          </sup>
          and i. A person possesses any two of the three alleles. I
          <sup>
           A
          </sup>
          and I
          <sup>
           B
          </sup>
          are codominant and they both are dominant over i. These alleles help to determine the blood group of a person. The plasma membrane of red blood cells has sugar polymers that protrude out from its surface and the kind of sugar is regulated by the gene ‘I’ of ABO blood group. The alleles I
          <sup>
           A
          </sup>
          and I
          <sup>
           B
          </sup>
          produce enzymes that produce A and B types of sugar respectively on the surface of red blood cells, while allele i does not produce any sugar.

          Identify in which of the crosses, the strength of linkage between the genes is higher. Give reasons in support of your answer. (Foreign 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The strength of linkage is higher in the cross A than in cross B because linkage is higher when two genes are present closely on the same chromosome than those genes which are far apart. In cross B, the chances of crossing over or recombination are higher because the genes are loosely linked.

          Question 34.
          <br/>
          In a cross between two tall pea plants, some of the offsprings produced were dwarf. Show with the help of Punnett square, how this is possible. (Delhi 2013)
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          When a tall pea plant was selfed, it produced one fourth of its progeny as dwarf. Explain with the help of a cross. (Delhi 2010)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Tall plants may either have genotype TT or Tt. Two tall pea plants that produce some dwarf plants among their progenies must be heterozygous with the genotype Tt. Plants with genotype TT cannot produce dwarf offspring as they lack the allele for dwarfness (t) and hence, cannot transfer it to the progeny. But, if both the parents are heterozygous tall (Tt), 25% of F, progeny would contain ‘t’ allele in homozygous (tt) condition. It can be represented using Punnett square as follows

          -phenotypic dihybrid ratio. Explain, giving reasons Morgan’s observation. (Foreign 2011)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The results obtained were due to the linkage. It is the phenomenon in which two or more linked genes are inherited together and their frequency of recombination in a test cross progeny is less than the expected 50%. In Morgan’s experiment on Drosophila, the genes for eye colour and body colour show linkage and do not allow crossing over during gamete formation. Hence, parental type progeny is in greater ratio than that of recombinants.

         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           In a diploid organism, the factors (genes) and chromosomes occur in pairs.
          </li>
          <li>
           Both chromosomes as well as genes segregate at the time of gamete formation such that only one of each pair is transmitted to a gamete.
          </li>
          <li>
           A gamete contains only one chromosome of a type and only one of the two alleles of a trait.

          Question 40.
          <br/>
          (i) Explain linkage and recombination as put forth by TH Morgan based on his observations with Drosophila melanogaster crossing experiment.
          <br/>
          (ii) Write the basis on which Alfred Sturtevant explained gene mapping. (Delhi 2019)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) TH Morgan studied X-linked gene in Drosophila and saw that when the two genes in a dihybrid cross were situated on the same chromosome, the proportion of parental gene combinations were much higher than the non-parental type.
          <br/>
          He attributed this due to the physical association or linkage of the two genes on a chromosome and coined the term linkage. The term recombination describes the generation of non-parental gene combination in offsprings.
         </p>
         <p>
          (ii) Alfred Sturtevant explained gene mapping by using the frequency of recombination between the gene pairs on the same chromosome as a measure of the distance between genes and he mapped their position on the chromosome.

          Question 41.
          <br/>
          What is a test cross? How can it decipher the heterozygosity of a plant? (All India 2016)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Test Cross This is a method devised by Mendel to determine the genotype of an organism. In this cross, the organism with an unknown dominant genotype is crossed with the recessive parent, instead of self-crossing. For example, in a monohybrid cross, between violet colour flower (W) and white colour flower (w), the F
          <sub>
           1
          </sub>
          -hybrid was a violet colour flower. If all the F
          <sub>
           1
          </sub>
          -progenies are of violet colour, then the dominant flower is homozygous and if the progenies are in 1 : 1 ratio, then it is deciphered that dominant flower is heterozygous.

          Question 47.
          <br/>
          Explain with the help of a suitable example, the inheritance of a trait where two different dominant alleles of a trait express themselves simultaneously in the progeny. Name this kind of inheritance pattern. (All India 2014C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Codominance is the inheritance of a trait where two different dominant alleles of a trait express themselves simultaneously in the progeny.
          <br/>
          For example, ABO blood groups in human population.
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Gene T for blood group exhibits three allelic forms, i.e. I
           <sup>
            A
           </sup>
           , I
           <sup>
            B
           </sup>
           and i.
          </li>
          <li>
           I
           <sup>
            A
           </sup>
           and I
           <sup>
            B
           </sup>
           produce RBC surface antigen A and B respectively, whereas i does not produce any antigen.
          </li>
          <li>
           I
           <sup>
            A
           </sup>
           and I
           <sup>
            B
           </sup>
           are codominant alleles, and they both are dominant over ‘i’ which is a recessive allele.
          </li>
          <li>
           In case I
           <sup>
            A
           </sup>
           and I
           <sup>
            B
           </sup>
           are present together, both express themselves equally and produce both surface antigen A and B. The resultant offspring is of ‘AB’ blood type.

          Question 48.
          <br/>
          Explain polygenic inheritance with the help of a suitable example. (All India 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Polygenic inheritance is an inheritance pattern controlled by three or more genes (multiple genes) and the graded phenotypes are due to the additive or cumulative effect of all the different genes of the trait, e.g. skin colour in human population shows variation.
         </p>
         <p>
          Skin colour in humans is produced by a pigment called melanin. The quantity of melanin is due to three pairs of polygenes (A, B and C). If a black or very dark (AA BB CC) and white or very light (aa bb cc) individuals marry each other, the offsprings or individuals of F
          <sub>
           1
          </sub>
          -generation show intermediate colour and they are often called mulatto (Aa Bb Cc).
         </p>
         <p>
          A total of eight allele combinations are possible in the gametes forming 27 distinct genotypes distributed into 7 phenotypes, i.e. 1 very dark,
          <br/>
          6 dark, 15 fairly dark, 20 intermediate, 15 fairly light and 1 very light.

          Question 49.
          <br/>
          Morgan carried out several dihybrid crosses in Drosophila and found F
          <sub>
           2
          </sub>
          ratios deviated very significantly from the expected Mendelian ratio. Explain his finding with the help of an example. (All India 2014C; Delhi 2010)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Morgan’s studies on Drosophila were based on the genes that were located on the X-chromosome. He found when the two genes in a dihybrid cross were situated on the same chromosome, the proportion of parental gene combinations were much higher than the non-parental type. Morgan stated this association as linkage to describe the physical association of genes on a chromosome. Recombination is a term used to describe the generation of non-parental gene combination. Morgan also found that some genes were tightly linked (low recombination) and others were loosely linked (high recombination). He concluded that in case of inheritance of linked genes, the phenotypic ratio deviates from expected 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 ratio of Mendel’s dihybrid cross.
         </p>
         <p>
          To prove his findings, Morgan hybridised yellow-bodied and white-eyed females with brown-bodied and red-eyed males (wild type) and intercrossed their F
          <sub>
           1
          </sub>
          -progeny (cross A). It was observed that the two genes did not segregate independently for each other and the F
          <sub>
           2
          </sub>
          -ratio deviated significantly from 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 ratio.
         </p>
         <p>
          In F
          <sub>
           2
          </sub>
          -generation, parental combinations were 98.7% and the recombinants were 1.3%. In another cross (cross B), between white-bodied female fly with miniature wing and a male fly with yellow body and normal wing, parental combinations were 62.8% and recombinants were 37.2% in F
          <sub>
           2
          </sub>
          -generation. Thus, it was proved from the crosses that the linkage between genes for yellow body and white eyes was stronger than the linkage between the white body and miniature wing.
         </p>
         <p>
          Question 50.
          <br/>
          (i) Write the conclusion Mendel arrived at on dominance of traits on the basis of monohybrid crosses that he carried out in pea plants.
          <br/>
          (ii) Explain why a recessive allele is unable to express itself in a heterozygous state. (Foreign 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) In a monohybrid cross in pea plant, Mendel found that only dominant trait expresses itself in offspring no matter it is whether present in homozygous state (TT) or in heterozygous state (Tt). Dominant trait does not require another similar allele to produce its effect on the phenotype, in fact it has the ability to mask the effect of recessive allele. Based on this observation, Mendel proposed the law of dominance.
         </p>
         <p>
          (ii) Since, the characters are controlled by genes which occur in pair, when two alternate forms of a trait or character (genes or alleles) are present in an organism, only one factor expresses itself in F
          <sub>
           1
          </sub>
          -generation. This factor is dominant, while the other factor that remains masked by the dominant factor is called as recessive.
         </p>
         <p>
          The recessive allele is unable to express itself in a heterozygous state because it forms an incomplete or defective polypeptide or enzyme, so its expression does not contain any effect. In contrast, dominant allele can form complete polypeptide or enzyme to express its effect.
         </p>
         <p>
          Question 51.
          <br/>
          In pea plants, the colour of the flower is either violet or white, whereas human skin colour shows many gradation.
          <br/>
          Explain giving reasons how it is possible. (Delhi 2013C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          In pea plants, the colour of the flower is either violet or white because the colour is purely dependent on two alleles and the crossing between them, i.e. violet and white in the parents generation, which results in F
          <sub>
           1
          </sub>
          -generation. Thus, the resultant offsprings are either violet or white coloured. Hence, the inheritance pattern of flower colour in pea plant follows the law of dominance.
         </p>
         <p>
          But in case of humans, skin colour is produced by polygenes. Such inheritance is controlled by one or more genes in which dominant alleles have cumulative effect with each dominant allele expressing a part of the trait. The full trait is shown only when all the dominant alleles are present together.
         </p>

          (i) Write the scientific name of the organism Thomas Hunt Morgan and his colleagues worked with for their experiments.
          <br/>
          Explain the correlation between linkage and recombination with respect to genes as studied by them.
          <br/>
          (ii) How did Sturtevant explain gene mapping while working with Morgan? (2018)

          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) Thomas Hunt Morgan and his colleagues worked on Drosophila melanogaster.
          <br/>
          Relation between Linkage and Recombination:
          <br/>
          Morgan carried out dihybrid crosses in Drosophila to study sex-linked genes. Morgan hybridised yellow-bodied, white-eyed females to brown-bodied, red-eyed males. He intercrossed their F
          <sub>
           1
          </sub>
          – progeny. It was observed that the two genes did not segregate independently of each other. The F
          <sub>
           2
          </sub>
          ratio deviated from the ratio of 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.
         </p>
         <p>
          It was known to Morgan and his colleagues that genes were located on X-chromosomes. They noticed that when the two genes in a dihybrid cross were situated on the same chromosome, the proportion of parental combination was very high in comparison to non-parental type. He attributed this due to the physical association or linkage of the two genes. To describe this physical association of gene, he coined the term linkage. Recombination term was used to describe the generation of non-parental gene combinations. In his experiments, he observed that even when genes were grouped on the same chromosome, some genes were very tightly linked and showed very low recombination. On the other hand, loosely linked genes showed higher recombination.
         </p>
         <p>
          (ii) Sturtevant, a student of Morgan, used the frequency of recombination between the gene pairs on the same chromosomes as a measure of the distance between genes. He mapped the position of genes on the chromosome by using this information.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Law of Independent Assortment (Third law) is based on the inheritance of two genes, i.e. dihybrid cross which states that when two pairs of contrasting traits are combined in a hybrid, segregation of one pair of characters is independent of the other pair of characters.

         </p>
         <p>
          These factors randomly rearrange in the offspring producing both parental and new combination of characters. It means inheritance of one character does not affect the inheritance of another character and both characters assort independently during gamete formation. The Punnett square can be used to understand the independent segregation of the two pairs of genes during meiosis.

          Question 59.
          <br/>
          (i) What is polygenic inheritance? Explain with the help of a suitable example.
          <br/>
          (ii) How &amp;re pleiotropy and Mendelian pattern of inheritance different from polygenic pattern of inheritance? (All India 2016)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) Polygenic Inheritance It was proposed by Galton in 1833 and he suggested that many instances of continuous variations are heritable. In this case, a trait is controlled by three or more genes and the graded phenotypes develop due to the additive or cumulative effect of all the different genes of the trait, e.g. human skin colour, height, intelligence etc.
          <br/>
          Polygene is a gene where one dominant allele controls only a unit or partial quantitative expression of a trait.
          <br/>

          <br/>
          It also takes into account the influence of environment and is also called as quantitative inheritance, as the character or phenotype can be quantified, like the amount of pigment, intelligence in human beings and milk yield in animals. These characters have been found to be determined by many genes and their effects have been cumulative. These traits are called polygenic traits, e.g. human skin colour explains the phenomenon of polygenic inheritance. Skin colour in human is produced by a pigment called melanin. The quantity of melanin is due to three pairs of polygenes (A, B and C). If black or very dark (AABBCC) and white or very light (aabbcc) individuals marry each other, the offsprings or individuals of F,-generation show intermediate colour which are often called mulatto (AaBbCc).
         </p>
         <p>
          A total of eight allele combinations are possible in the gametes forming 27 distinct genotypes distributed into 7 phenotypes, i.e. 1 very dark, 6 dark, 15 fairly dark, 20 intermediate, 15 fairly light, 6 light and 1 very light.
         </p>
         <p>
          (ii) In pleiotropy, single gene product may produce multiple or more than one phenotypic effect whereas in polygenic inheritance single phenotypic trait (human skin colour) is controlled by 3 pairs of genes (A, B and C). In Mendelian inheritance, one gene controls one phenotypic character (flower colour red or white). However, in polygenic inheritnace one phenotype is controlled by more than one gene.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) Law of segregation states that the factors or alleles of a pair segregate from each other during gamete formation in a way that a gamete receives only one of the two factors. They do not show any blending. The pattern of inheritance can be understood by crossing F

          -hybrid (Tt heterozygous) of a tall plant with a dwarf plant.
          <br/>
          Here, hybrid tall makes two types of gametes (T) and (t), while pure dwarf makes only one type of gamete, i.e. (t). It is because only one allele can enter in a gamete for a character.

          population led to a 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 phenotypic ratio. (All India 2015)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The cross given in the question is a dihybrid cross, which explains the third law of Mendel, i.e. law of independent assortment. In a dihybrid cross inheritance pattern of two traits are considered simultaneously.
          <br/>
          This law states that when two pairs of traits are combined in a hybrid, segregation of one pair of character is independent of the other pair of characters at the time of gamete formation.

          (ii) Explain codominance taking an example of human blood groups in the population. (All India 2013)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) Difference between dominance and codominance is as follows
          <br/>
          Dominance:
          <br/>
          Out of the two contrasting alleles of a gene, only one can produce effect in heterozygous condition, e.g. trait of tallness in pea plants.
         </p>
         <p>
          Codominance:
          <br/>
          Both the alternative forms of a gene can produce effect in heterozygous condition, e.g. ABO blood grouping in humans.

          Question 67.
          <br/>
          What is the inheritance pattern observed in the size of starch grains and seed shape of Pisum sativum. Work out the monohybrid cross showing the above traits. How does this pattern of inheritance deviate from that of Mendelian law of dominance? (Delhi 2013)
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          Pea seeds with BB alleles have round seeds and large starch grains, while seeds with bb alleles have wrinkled seeds with small starch grains.
          <br/>
          Work out the cross between these two parents. Explain the phenotypic ratio of the progeny with respect to seed shape and the starch grain size of the progeny produced. (All India 2012C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The starch synthesis in pea plants is controlled by a single gene. It has two alleles B and b. BB homozygotes produce large starch grains as compared to that produced by bb homozygotes.
         </p>
         <p>
          After maturation, it was observed that BB seeds were round and bb were wrinkled. When they were crossed, the resultant progeny have intermediate sized (Bb) seeds.
          <br/>
          The cross involved is
          <br/>
          <img alt="Principles of Inheritance and Variation Class 12 Important Questions and Answers Biology Chapter 5 Img 19" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-147357" height="227" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Principles-of-Inheritance-and-Variation-Class-12-Important-Questions-and-Answers-Biology-Chapter-5-Img-19.png" width="245"/>
         </p>
         <p>
          Deviation from Mendel’s law of dominance: If starch grain size is considered as the phenotype, then, the alleles show incomplete dominance.
          <br/>
          Thus, dominance is not an autonomous feature of a gene, it depends on gene product and production of particular phenotype from this product.

          Question 77.
          <br/>
          Give one example of organism exhibiting female heterogamety. (Outside Delhi 2016C)
          <br/>
          Or

          Write the chromosomal basis of sex-determination in birds. (Delhi 2016C)
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          Explain the mechanism of sex-determination in birds. (Delhi 2015)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Female heterogamety is exhibited by birds. They have ZW-ZZ type of sex-determination mechanism. In this type, the male is homogametic and the female is heterogametic. Therefore, there are two types of eggs, i.e. with Z and with W and only one type of sperms, i.e. each with Z.
         </p>
         <p>
          When egg with Z-chromosome is fertilised by a sperm with Z-chromosome, a zygote with ZZ-chromosomes (male) is formed. Similarly when egg with W-chromosome is fertilised by a sperm with Z-chromosome, a zygote with ZW-chromosomes (female) is formed.

          Question 81.
          <br/>
          Why do normal red blood cells become
          <br/>
          elongated and sickle-shaped in structure in a person suffering from sickle-cell anaemia? (Foreign 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          In sickle-cell anaemia, substitution of valine in place of glutamic acid in the sixth position of haemoglobin chain occurs. The mutant haemoglobin molecule undergoes polymerisation under low oxygen tension causing the change in the shape of the RBC from biconcave disc to the elongated sickle-like structure.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          This is due to non-disjunction, i.e. failure of segregation of homologous chromosomes during gamete formation resulting in the gain of an extra copy of chromosome number 21 (21 Trisomy).

          <br/>
          The son of a haemophilic man may not get this genetic disorder. Mention the reason. (Delhi 2010C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The gene responsible for haemophilia is located on X-chromosome and males have only single copy of X-chromosome with no alternate normal allele. The son gets X-chromosome from mother only. So, if the female is normal, the son may not get this genetic disorder from male (father).

          A couple with normal vision bears a colourblind child. Work out the cross to show how it is possible and mention the sex of the affected child. (Delhi 2016)
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          A colourblind child is born to a normal couple. Work out a cross to show how it is possible. Mention the sex of this child. (Delhi 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Colour blindness is a sex-linked disease which results in the defect in either red or green cone cells of eyes. The gene for this disorder is present on the X-chromosome. Hence, it is carried by normal females that do not express the disease.
         </p>
         <p>
          If a colourblind child is born to a normal couple, then the mother would be the carrier of the disease. The following cross shows the inheritance of the disorder
          <br/>
          <img alt="Principles of Inheritance and Variation Class 12 Important Questions and Answers Biology Chapter 5 Img 25" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-147365" height="196" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Principles-of-Inheritance-and-Variation-Class-12-Important-Questions-and-Answers-Biology-Chapter-5-Img-25.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Principles-of-Inheritance-and-Variation-Class-12-Important-Questions-and-Answers-Biology-Chapter-5-Img-25.png 336w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Principles-of-Inheritance-and-Variation-Class-12-Important-Questions-and-Answers-Biology-Chapter-5-Img-25-300x175.png 300w" width="336"/>

          Why is the possibility of a human female suffering from haemophilia rare? Explain. (Foreign 2014, All India 2012,2013,2014C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Haemophilia is an X-linked recessive disease. Therefore, the females having haemophilic allele on single X-chromosome do not produce haemophilic phenotype. Females suffer from this disease only if the father is haemophilic and the mother is at least the carrier of disease. Such condition is rare and hence, the human females are rarely haemophilic.

          Question 93.
          <br/>
          Why is pedigree analysis done in the study of human genetics? State the conclusions that can be drawn from it. (All India 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The study of inheritance of genetic traits in several generations of a human family in the form of a family diagram is called pedigree analysis. Inheritance pattern of traits in human beings cannot be studied by crosses. Thus, pedigree analysis is done. Based on the pedigree studies, inheritance of a specific trait, abnormality or disease can be traced.

          Question 96.
          <br/>
          Name a blood related autosomal Mendelian disorder. Why is it called Mendelian disorder? How is the disorder transmitted from parents to offspring? (All India 2014C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          A blood related autosomal Mendelian genetic disorder is sickle-cell anaemia. It occurs by the change of a single base pair in the gene, leading to the substitution of glutamic acid by valine at the 6th position of p-globin chain of haemoglobin.
         </p>
         <p>
          Since, its transmission follows Mendelian principles, it is called Mendelian disorder. Inheritance pattern It is transmitted from parents to the offspring, when both the partners are carriers (heterozygous) of the disease.

          Question 97.
          <br/>
          Write the types of sex-determination mechanisms the following crosses show. Give an example of each type.
          <br/>
          (i) Female XX with male XO.
          <br/>
          (ii) Female ZW with male ZZ. (Delhi 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) The type of sex-determination mechanism shown in female XX and males XO is called male heterogamety. In this case, males are heterogametic with half of the male gametes carrying X-chromosome while the other half being devoid of it, e.g. grasshopper.
         </p>
         <p>
          (ii) The type of sex-determination mechanism is female heterogamety because female produces two different types of gametes, i.e. Z and W while males are ZZ type, e.g. birds.

          <br/>
          (i) sex-linked (ii) caused by X-linked gene.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The pedigree of a family given in the question depicts that mother is normal (XX), while father is haemophilic (X
          <sup>
           h
          </sup>
          Y). As haemophilia is a sex-linked disease, F
          <sub>
           1
          </sub>
          -generation will produce 50% carrier daughters and 50% normal sons. In F
          <sub>
           2
          </sub>
          -generation, both carrier daughters got married to a normal man and produced 25% diseased (X
          <sup>
           h
          </sup>
          Y) and 25% normal son (XY) and 25% carrier (X
          <sup>
           C
          </sup>
          X) and 25% normal daughter (XX).
         </p>
         <p>
          Or
          <br/>
          (i) (a) It is X-linked trait which is transmitted from an unaffected carrier female to some of the male offsprings.
          <br/>
          (b) Females rarely become haemophilic as in this cases, the mother has to be at least a carrier and father should be haemophilic.
         </p>
         <p>
          (ii) Gene for haemophilia is X-linked or present on X-chromosome because male receives this gene from mother.
          <br/>
          (a) So, a carrier female transmits it to her son.
          <br/>
          (b) Disease appears more in males because they have only one X-chromosome.

          <br/>
          The codon for the sixth amino acid is GAG. The sixth codon GAG mutates to GAA as a result of mutation ‘A’ and to GUG as a result of mutation ‘B’. Haemoglobin structure did not change as a result of mutation ‘A’, whereas haemoglobin structure changed because of mutation ‘B’ leading to sickle-shaped RBCs.
          <br/>
          Explain giving reasons how. could mutation ‘B’ lead to sickle-shaped RBCs. Explain giving reasons how could mutation.‘B’ change the haemoglobin structure or bring down mutation and not mutation ‘A’. (All India 2011)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          In mutation A, the change in amino acid does not occur when codon GAG changes to GAA because both GAG and GAA code for amino acid, glutamic acid. Thus, there is no change in haemoglobin structure.
         </p>
         <p>
          In mutation B, the change in amino acid occurs when codon GAG is changed to GUG because GUG codes for valine, while the original codon GAG codes for glutamic acid. Thus, there will be a change in the haemoglobin structure which would lead to sickle-cell anaemia.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) This representation indicates normal human because normal peptide Hb

          Both haemophilia and thalassemia are blood related disorders in humans. Write their causes and the difference between the two. Name the category of genetic disorder they both come under. (All India 2017)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Haemophilia and thalassemia both are Mendelian or gene related human disorders.
          <br/>
          Cause of Haemophilia It is caused due to the absence of antihaemophilic globulin and plasma thromboplastin factor.
          <br/>
          Cause of Thalassemia It is caused due to mutation or deletion of the genes controlling the formation of globin chains (a and P) of haemoglobin.

          Question 107.
          <br/>
          Which chromosomes carry the mutant genes causing thalassemia in humans? What are the problems caused by these mutant genes? (Delhi 2015)
          <br/>
          Or

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Thalassemia is an autosomal-linked recessive disease, which occurs due to either mutation or deletion of genes, resulting in reduced rate of synthesis of one of the globin chains of haemoglobin. It is associated with the mutation in chromosome 11 or 16 which code for p-chain and a – chain of haemoglobin, respectively. Haemoglobin is the oxygen carrying component of the red blood cells. It consists of two different proteins, an a and a p. If the body does not produce enough of either of these two proteins, the red blood cells do not form properly and cannot carry sufficient oxygen.
          <br/>
          This results in anaemia that begins in early childhood and lasts throughout the life.

          <br/>
          (ii) Explain the cause of such chromosomal disorder. (Delhi 2011c)

          <br/>
          XO abnormality or monosomy of
          <br/>
          X-chromosome represents chromosomal disorder called Turner’s syndrome.
         </p>
         <p>
          Non-disjunction is responsible for this chromosomal disorder. It is the phenomenon of failure of segregation of the members of homologous pairs of the chromosomes. Such disorder occurs due to the absence of one X-chromosome, i.e. 45 with XO (karyotype). The affected individual has underdeveloped feminine characters. Females are sterile and ovaries are rudimentary.

          Question 109.
          <br/>
          (i) Sickle-cell anaemia in humans is a result of point mutation. Explain.

          (ii) Write the genotypes of both the parents, who have produced a sickle-celled anaemic offspring. (Delhi 2011)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) Point mutation occurs due to change in a single base pair of DNA. Sickle-cell anaemia occurs due to defect caused by the single base substitution at the sixth codon of the P-chain of haemoglobin from GAG to GUG.
         </p>
         <p>
          This causes substitution of glutamic acid by valine. The defective haemoglobin molecule undergoes polymerisation under low oxygen tension causing sickle-shaped red blood cells.

          Question 111.
          <br/>
          (i) Why are grasshopper and Drosophila said to show male heterogamety? Explain.

          Explain the mechanism of sex-determination in insects like Drosophila and grasshopper. (All India 2010)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) In male heterogamety, males produce two different types of gametes. In humans and Drosophila, the males have one X and Y chromosome, whereas in grasshopper, the male have only one X-chromosome (XO type). Thus, the males of these organisms show male heterogamety as they produce two types of gametes
          <br/>
          Either with or without X-chromosome
          <br/>
          Some gametes with X-chromosome and some with Y-chromosome.
         </p>
         <p>
          (ii) In some organisms, females produce two different types of gametes. This is termed as female heterogamety. In birds and some reptiles, female has two different sex chromosomes (one Z and one W-chromosome) whereas male has a pair of same chromosome (a pair of Z-chromosome). (11/2)

          Question 112.
          <br/>
          (i) Why are thalassemia and haemophilia categorised as Mendelian disorders? Write the symptoms of these diseases. Explain their pattern of inheritance in humans.
          <br/>
          (ii) Write the genotypes of the normal parents producing a haemophilic son. (All India 2015)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) Thalassemia and haemophilia are categorised as Mendelian disorders because these disorders are due to alteration in a single gene. Also, they are transmitted to offspring through Mendelian principles of inheritance.
          <br/>
          Symptoms and pattern of inheritance are given below
         </p>
         <p>
          (a) Thalassemia It is an autosome-linked recessive blood disorder characterised by defect in α, ß or δ-chain resulting in abnormal Hb molecule.
          <br/>
          Symptom Anaemia: Inheritance Two mutant alleles (one from each parent) must be inherited for an individual to be affected, i.e. homozygous. Heterozygous are carriers and may pass the mutant allele to their children.
         </p>
         <p>
          (b) Haemophilia It is a sex-linked recessive disorder whose gene is located on X-chromosome.
          <br/>
          Symptom Prolonged clotting time and internal bleeding, even in a minor injury.
         </p>
         <p>
          Inheritance The gene is present on X-chromosome, so it is inherited by males as they have a single X-chromosome. Affected males are said to be hemizygous. Females have 2 X-chromosomes, thus their possibility of being affected is rare as the mother of such female has to be at least carrier and father should be haemophilic.
         </p>
         <p>
          (ii) Genotypes of the normal parents producing a haemophilic son are X
          <sup>
           C
          </sup>
          X (carrier mother) and XY (father).

          Question 113.
          <br/>
          (i) Why are colour blindness and thalassemia categorised as Mendelian disorders? Write the symptoms of these diseases seen in people suffering from them.
          <br/>
          (ii) About 8% of human male population suffers from colour blindness whereas only about 0.4% of human female population suffers from this disease. Write an explanation to show how it is possible. (All India 2015)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) The inheritance pattern of colour blindness is same as that of haemophilia. Refer to Answer No. 41.
         </p>
         <p>
          (ii) Colour blindness is an X-linked recessive trait which shows transmission from carrier female progeny. In males, the defect can appear in heterozygous condition beacause males possess only one X-chromosome whereas in females, it appears in homozygous condition only, which is very rare. Thus, it is more common in males than females.

          (i) Explain the mechanism of sex-determination in humans.
          <br/>
          (ii) Differentiate between male heterogamety and female heterogamety with the help of an example of each. (All India 2013)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) Refer to Answer No. 24.
         </p>
         <p>
          (ii) A sex (male or female) is heterogametic, if it has two different sex chromosomes.
          <br/>
          Male heterogamety The female has two X-chromosomes (XX), while male has only one X-chromosome and at the time of gametogenesis the latter produces two types of gametes, 50% with X-chromosome, while other 50% without X-chromosomes. Heterogametic r tales are of two types
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           XX-XY type, e.g. Drosophila, man, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
           XX-XO type, e.g. insects like grasshopper. Female heterogamety In some species like birds,’fishes, etc. females are heterogametic, i.e. produce two types of gametes, while males produce only one type of gamete.

          Question 115.
          <br/>
          (i) Why is haemophilia generally observed in human males? Explain the conditions under which a human female can be haemophilic.
          <br/>
          (ii) A pregnant human female was advised to undergo MTP. It was diagnosed by her doctor that the foetus she is carrying has developed from a zygote formed by an XX-egg fertilised by Y carrying sperm. Why was she advised to undergo MTP? (All India 2011)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) The genes for haemophilia are present on X-chromosome. A male has only one X-chromosome and bears only one allele for the trait. He is hemizygous for the trait as Y-chromosome does not have a corresponding allele. A female contains two X-chromosomes. She has to be homozygous recessive to be haemophilic. It means her father must be a sufferer and mother must be either a carrier or sufferer to carry forward the disease.
         </p>
         <p>
          (ii) The zygote will have XXY-chromosomes.
          <br/>
          It will develop into a male with Klinefelter’s syndrome. Such males are sterile and show feminine characters. That is why, female was advised to undergo MTP.

          Explain the causes, inheritance pattern and symptoms of any two Mendelian genetic disorders. (Delhi 2010)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Two Mendelian genetic disorders are as follows
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Sickle-cell anaemia Refer to Answer No. 25.
          </li>
          <li>
           Phenylketonuria It occurs due to defective allele on the autosome. It is inherited from parent, who are heterozygous for the gene to the offspring.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          The affected individual lacks an enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase that converts the amino acid phenylalanine into tyrosine. As a result, phenylalanine gets accumulated in brain and body and gets converted into phenyl pyruvate and other derivatives.
         </p>

          <br/>
          In heterozygous hybrid, when both alternative alleles coexist, both the alleles show their effect and result in the progeny with AB blood group. This is called codominance.

          Question 120.
          <br/>
          Naresh, a haemophilia patient, forbades his daughter to marry Mohan who is also a haemophilia patient. Is Naresh right?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Naresh is right because his daughter can be carrier of haemophilia disease (an X-linked disorder).
          <br/>
          If she marries a haemophilic person, there are 75% chances that their offspring will also suffer from haemophilia.

          Question 121.
          <br/>
          Avantika’e doctor advised her to undergo MTP because through diagnostic tests she came to know that her foetus has XO chromosomes. Do you think Avantika should undergo MTP? Give reason.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) Yes, Avantika should undergo MTP.
          <br/>
          (ii) The foetus contains XO chromosomes, i.e. one X-chromosome is lacking.
          <br/>
          It means that the baby will be suffering from Turner’s syndrome. Therefore, MTP is recommended.

          Question 122.
          <br/>
          Prateek was rushed to a nearby hospital after an accident, which had caused too much blood loss. The hospital failed to supply O negative blood for transfusion. Asif, who was attending a patient there, heard about the situation and agreed to donate blood as he had the same blood group. Prateek’s mother initially refused but was later convinced by her daughter’s view.
          <br/>
          (i) Why cannot O positive blood be transfused into Prateek’s body?
          <br/>
          (ii) Human blood grouping is an example of?
          <br/>
          (iii) What values do you find in Prateek’s sister and Asif?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) O
          <sup>
           +
          </sup>
          blood group contains antigen for Rh factor. Rh
          <sup>
           –
          </sup>
          blood lacks the antigen, so if the two blood mix, it will lead to clotting and thus, death of the patient.
          <br/>
          (ii) Multiple allelism.
          <br/>
          (iii) Prateek’s sister shows understanding of science and Asif believes in helping a person in need without thinking about which religion or caste he belongs to.
