          Question 1.
          <br/>
          Read the passage given below: [12]
          <br/>
          Donated Organs and their Transportation
          <br/>
          1. Once an organ donor’s family gives its consent and the organs are matched to a recipient, medical professionals are faced with the onerous challenge of transporting organs while ensuring that the harvested organ reaches its destination in the shortest possible time. This is done in order to preserve the harvested organs and involves the police and especially the traffic police department.
         </p>
         <p>
          2. The traditional method of transporting organs by road is referred to as a “green corridor”. This process entails police escorting an ambulance, so as to move around traffic – usually a specific traffic lane is chosen and all signals on the route stay green to ensure it to reach its destination in the shortest possible time. A ‘green corridor’ is a route cleared and cordoned off by the traffic police to ensure the smooth and steady transportation of harvested organs, on most occasions, to those awaiting a life-saving transplant. Organs tend to have a very short preservation time, such as the heart which has to be harvested and transplanted within four hours or the lungs which can be preserved for only six hours once they are harvested.
         </p>
         <p>
          3. The first green corridor in India was created by Chennai Traffic Police in September 2008 when they accomplished their task of enabling an ambulance to reach its destination within 11 minutes during peak hour traffic. That organ saved a nine-year-old girl whose life depended on the transplant.
         </p>
         <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
         </div>
         <p>
          4. Similarly, such green corridors have been created by traffic police of various cities such as Pune, Mumbai, Delhi NCR etc. Personnel are stationed at selected points to divert, control and clear the traffic giving way to the ambulance. Apart from this, a motorcade of police vehicles accompanies the ambulance ensuring that it does not face any problems. Delhi Traffic Police provided a green corridor from IGI Airport to Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences in Vasant Kunj for transportation of a liver. The distance of 14 kms was covered in 11 minutes.
         </p>
         <p>
          5. Experts point out the lack of a robust system to transport organs to super-speciality hospitals in least possible time. National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO), the country’s apex orgarf”donation agency, is now framing a proposal to airlift cadaver organs and will send a report to the Union Health Ministry. “Cadaver organs have a short life and so transplant should be done within a few golden hours, “Director (NOTTO) expressed, “Therefore, we are preparing a proposal for airlifting organs at any given moment.”
         </p>

          6. Most states do not have enough well-trained experts to retrieve or perform transplant procedures. Also, there is an acute shortage of advanced healthcare facilities to carry out a transplant. So, it is referred to other big centres in metropolitan cities. Organs retrieved from Aurangabad, Indore, Surat, Pune are sent to Mumbai as these cities do not have super-speciality healthcare centres, informed officials.
         </p>
         <p>
          7. “In India, about fifty thousand to one lakh patients are suffering from acute heart failure and need heart transplant at any point of time. In a private set-up, a heart transplant costs ?15-20 lakhs, which is followed up by postoperative medication of about T30,000 per month lifelong.”

         <p>
          Question 2.
          <br/>
          Read the following passage: [8]
         </p>
         <p>
          1. How does television affect our lives? It can be very helpful to people who carefully choose the shows that they watch. Television can increase our knowledge of the outside world; there are high-quality programmes that help us understand many fields of study, science, medicine, the different arts and so op. Moreover, television benefits very old people, who can’t leave the house, as well as patients in hospitals. It also offers non-native speakers the advantages of daily informal language practice. They can increase their vocabulary and practice listening.
         </p>
         <p>
          2. On the other hand, there are several serious disadvantages of television, of course, it provides us with a pleasant way to relax and spend our free time, but in some countries people watch television for an average of six hours or more a day. Many children stare at the TV screen for more hours a day than they spend on anything else, including studying and sleeping. It’s clear that TV has a powerful influence on their lives and that its influence is often negative.
         </p>
         <p>
          3. Recent studies show that after only thirty seconds of television viewing, a person’s brain ‘relaxes’ the same way that it does just before the person falls asleep. Another effect of television on the human brain is that it seems to cause poor concentration. Children who view a lot of television can often concentrate on a subject for only fifteen to twenty minutes. They can pay attention only for the amount of time between commercials.
         </p>
         <p>
          4. Another disadvantage is that television often causes people to become dissatisfied with their own lives. Real life does not seem so exciting to these people. To many people, television becomes more real than reality and their own lives seem boring. Also many people get upset or depressed when they can’t solve problems in real life as quickly as television actors seem to.
         </p>
         <p>
          5. Before a child is fourteen years old, he or she views eleven thousand murders on the TV’. He or she begins to believe that there is nothing strange about fights, killings and other kinds of violence. Many studies show that people become more violent after viewing certain programmes. They may even do the things that they see in a violent show.

          (b) Summary: Television has both positive and negative impacts on our lives. If we choose carefully the shows we watch, it can increase our knowledge on a variety of subjects. It entertains old people and patients in hospitals. But it has serious disadvantages also especially among children who neglect their studies, compromise on their sleep and lose concentration when they get glued to the television. Adults too become dissatisfied because real life is not as exciting as reel life. Television shows encourage violence because children feel it is quite normal and there is nothing strange about it.

          Subject: An Intellectually Enriching Book Fair
          <br/>
          Through the medium of the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I wish to draw your kind attention towards the Book Exhibition successfully organised by the Book Trust of India in our neighbourhood, in the Raja Garden grounds for three days. Many reputed national and international publishers participated in this event. This fair was inaugurated by the Vice Chancellor of Indira Gandhi National Open University, Professor Kumar. He appreciated all the arrangements made at the book fair and also visited many stalls and thanked the publishers for making the book fair such a success.
         </p>
         <p>
          Many people enthusiastically visited the book fair as it housed a good collection of academic, fiction, research and general books. This book fair is likely to play a pivotal role in reiterating the importance of books and is likely to be recognized as a huge annual cultural event of book bonanza keenly awaited by students, teachers, scholars, intellectuals, authors and book lovers. I feel more of such book fairs should be organised in other cities of the state also to promote the habit of reading.

          Good Morning! Respected Principal Ma’am, Teachers and my dear friends. I, Arana, have 288 come before you all to tell you how we students can help the victims affected by a natural disaster. While the Army and the National Disaster Response Force assist in evacuation, providing shelter and the basic amenities needed by these people, they need our help too so that food, clothes and medicines are easily and abundantly available to them.
          <br/>
          We can contact the NGOs who work for the rehabilitation of these victims and contribute food packets, clothes and the basic medicines for them. Wre can also donate items like matchboxes, candle packets, kerosene jail,, floor mats, blankets etc. We can collect these items from our friends and our neighbours. A little extra effort on our part will ensure that the lives of these flood or drought affected victims is rehabilitated to some extent.
          <br/>
          I would like to conclude by saying that ever}’ single act of generosity goes towards the rehabilitation of communities during disasters.
          <br/>
          Thank-you!

          ‘Rain harvesting is the only solution to water crisis in the present times.’ Write a debate either for or against the motion in 150-200 words. You are Sujatha/Ajith. [10]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Water conservation and water management has been a major issue due to the increasing water crisis. That is why rain harvesting is seen as one of the ideal solutions to the water shortage in the present times.
          <br/>
          Good Morning Everyone! I, Sujatha have come before you all to speak in favour of this motion. Though there are other solutions to counter the water crisis that we are facing, Rainwater harvesting is one of the most effective measures that we can take. By diverting rainwater and storing it we can reduce our dependence on Municipal Water Supply. Rainwater harvesting has enormous potential as it provides water during drought, can help mitigate flooding of low lying areas and enables to sustain ground water. With depleting ground water levels and fluctuating climatic conditions rainwater harvesting can help recharge the local aquifers, reduce urban flooding and most importantly it can ensure availability’ of water in the scarce areas.
          <br/>
          Rainwater harvesting is a traditional practice, which has regained recognition in the past few years and is considered as the most important and practical solution to the present water crisis problem.

          Question 6.

          Rising prices of essential commodities make life difficult for the common man. You are Nalini/Ranbir. Write an article in 150-200 words describing the causes, possible solutions and how students can help their parents to cope with the problem. [10]

          Answer:
          <br/>
          Rising Prices
          <br/>
          By: Nalini
          <br/>
          Inflation has attacked our economy like a stubborn plague that refuses to wear-off. The extreme hike in prices of essential commodities has hit specially the common man causing many hardships to him and making it very difficult for him to make both ends meet. Inflation has eroded the purchasing power of money which has led to a decrease in the real value of money. Though this price-rise is harmful to the overall economy it has especially impoverished the common man. An indifferent government watches the rise and does things which hardly benefit the common man whose savings fall drastically. The common man is thus left helplessly fighting this never ending price-rise on the city streets while our politicians claim to be finding ways to cope up with the problem of inflation in their airconditioned offices. But then there is no denying that the major brunt of inflation is definitely being borne by the common man whose life is becoming a tougher struggle with each passing day and there seems to be no solution to his relentless struggle in the near future.
         </p>
         <p>
          The problem of rising prices is one of the major problems our country is facing in the present times. This problem is two-fold, to check the rising prices and to bring the prices down. The government can play a vital role in this.
          <br/>
          Good Morning Everyone, I ……. have come before you all to speak in favour of the motion, “Rising prices can be controlled by the government”.
          <br/>
          The government needs to take stringent action against hoarders and black marketers who manipulate market prices, under the relevant legal procedures, so as to ensure that products reach market on time to moderate prices. The government also needs to review import and export of all essential commodities on a regular basis and impose controls on exports and ease restrictions on imports.
          <br/>
          Inflation can be controlled to a large extent if the government gives full freedom to farmers to sell their agricultural produce anywhere in India without any restriction and ensures free movement of the produce without taxation. The sudden and acute rise in prices causes an all round spiral effect on the price of goods and services thus making the life of the common man miserable.
          <br/>
          To fend off its responsibility the government attributes price rise to external factors. Though our governments have often talked about checking inflation, it has never outlined a confirmative strategy in this regard. If the government takes up concrete measures to control inflation the real welfare of the masses can be ensured.
          <br/>
          Thank You!
         </p>
         <p>
          Add : Students can help their parents cope with the problem of rising prices by not making unfair demands of material goods which they know will cause a strain on their parents’ pockets. They should understand and realize that their parents are already stressed to provide the best for them and the least they can do is to ensure that they do not over-strain their parents with their undue demands.

          A Verbal Dispute Amicably Resolved
          <br/>
          By : Balbir/Bimla
          <br/>
          I was witness to a verbal dispute which accelerated and led to a physical fight between an auto-rickshaw driver and his passenger, a middle-aged man, in front of our school gate.
          <br/>
          The scene turned ugly when the auto-rickshaw driver, who the passenger said was over-charging him, pushed the man who stumbled and almost fell on the road. He was absolutely livid then and charged at the driver to attack him, when a female teacher of our school intervened. At first she found it extremely difficult to handle the situation as tempers were flying very high. But she did not give up and after finding the cause of the quarrel, she tried relentlessly and with a lot of patience was able to resolve the issue. It took her some time and effort but she was ultimately able to calm down both the parties. It was indeed a commendable act on her part. Her timely intervention averted a situation which could have turned quite nasty and would have led to the involvement of the police. It is good people like her who prove the saying, “a stitch in time saves nine” absolutely correct.

          (g) When did the ‘Tiger King’ decide to get married?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Saheb worked at a tea stall. He was paid 800 rupees and was given all his meals, but the author says that he has lost his carefree looks as he is no longer his own master. The steel canister that Saheb carries is heavier than his plastic bag as it belongs to the man under whom he is working.
         </p>
         <p>
          (b) Some people make quite extravagant claims of an interview, being in its highest form — a source of truth, and in its practice — an art. An interview is also considered as a supremely serviceable medium-of communication. Denis Brian says that the most vivid impressions of our contemporaries are got through interviews. He feels that the interviewer holds a position of unprecedented power and influence.
         </p>
         <p>
          (c) Jansie is a realistic and practical girl who understands the fact that both she and Sophie are earmarked for the biscuit factory. So, she is critical of Sophie expressing her unrealistic wishes. Jansie tells her to behave sensibly.
         </p>
         <p>
          (d) These children are undernourished and impoverished and look almost like skeletons with their bones peeping through their skin. They are depressed and oppressed with the burdens of life and thus keep their heads down.
         </p>
         <p>
          (e) Mr. Lamb leaves the gates of his house always open because he did not mind strangers coming inside his house. In fact, he wanted everyone to feel welcomed. He liked sitting in his garden and kept the gates open so -that anybody could just walk in.
         </p>
         <p>
          (d) At first Zitkala-Sa cried aloud, shaking her head all the while till she felt the cold blades of the scissors against her neck. Thereafter, she lost her spirit and in her anguish moaned for her mother, but no one came to comfort her. She felt as helpless as a wooden puppet and as one of the many animals driven by a herder.
         </p>
         <p>
          (g) The Maharaja had killed seventy tigers and thus the tiger population became extinct in the forests of his kingdom. It was then that he decided to get married to a girl in a royal family of a state which had a large tiger population. He wanted to reach the target of 100 tigers to disprove the prediction of the astrologer.

          How did the swimming instructor build a swimmer out of Douglas?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The instructor put in serious effort to ‘build a swimmer’ out of Douglas. He understood Douglas’ mortal water-phobia and practiced five days a week, an hour each day, with him. He devised a unique way to teach him how to swim. He attached a rope to Douglas’ belt that went through a pulley which ran over an overhead cable. Holding the end of the rope in his hand, he made Douglas move back and forth in the pool without causing him much fear. Douglas was taught how to exhale under water and raise his nose to inhale. This exercise was repeated numerous times and they went to and fro across the pool week after week. The instructor then taught Douglas to kick with his legs. At first his legs would not work but finally he was able to control and command them. Finally he was transformed into quite a perfect swimmer by his instructor.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Gandhiji received summons to appear in court at Motihari. He telegraphed Rajendra Prasad to come from Bihar with influential friends. Next morning, the town of Motihari . was full of peasants who gathered around the courthouse only because they had heard that a Mahatma who wanted to help them, was in trouble with the authorities. This act was seen as the beginning of the peasants’ liberation from the fear of the British. The officials felt powerless without Gandhiji’s cooperation. He was the one who helped them regulate the crowds. The British government was baffled as Gandhiji was giving them the concrete proof that their power, which had till now remained unquestioned, could be challenged by the Indians. The Champaran episode revealed Gandhiji’s principles in the political field. It turned out to be Gandhiji’s loud pronouncement that the Britishers could no longer suppress Indian in their own country.

          Charley entered a tunnel and when he finally came out he was on the third level at Grand
          <br/>
          Central Station. For a moment he thought he was on the second level, but then he saw that the room was smaller. There were fewer ticket windows and train gates, and the information booth in the centre was wooden and old-looking. The lights there were dim and kind of flickering because they were open-flame gaslights. There were brass spittoons on the floor, and then he saw a man pulling a gold watch from his vest pocket. This man was wearing a derby hat, a four-buttoned suit and had a big, handlebar mustache. He then looked around and saw that everyone in the station was dressed like Eighteen- ninety-something. On the tracks, he saw a very small Currier &amp; Ives locomotive.

          How did Dr. Sadao resolve the conflict in his mind between his loyalty to his country and his duty as a doctor?

          Answer:
          <br/>
          Dr. Sadao was indeed a patriotic Japanese as well as a dedicated surgeon. An American run away prisoner in a badly wounded condition is washed ashore on Japanese doctor Sadao’s doorstep. The doctor is initially a little hesitant to save the prisoner’s life when he discovers the latter’s real identity. But being a dedicated surgeon he decides to treat the enemy soldier. He is able to save the prisoner’s life but being a patriotic Japanese he informs a superior Japanese Army General about the prisoner’s presence in his house and even agrees to have him killed by the General’s assassins. He spends three restless nights waiting for the assassins to carry out their job but when they do not arrive, he gives the prisoner his boat and helps him to escape safely thus honouring both the values that he was a patriotic Japanese as well as being a dedicated surgeon.

          Subject: Pathetic Condition of Kishore Nagar Central Park
          <br/>
          Sir,
          <br/>
          Through the medium of this letter I would like to bring to your notice the pathetic state of the central park in our locality, Kishore Nagar.
          <br/>
          This park is in a state of utter neglect. All the three gates of the park are broken and its greenery has almost vanished. The employees who are responsible for the upkeep of the park are seldom seen doing their assigned duties. Even when they come to the park it is only to sit, gossip and play cards. They while away their time irresponsibly and carelessly. On behalf of the residents of our locality, it is my request to you to take the required action to ensure that the broken gates are repaired and the employees who are responsible for the maintenance of the park carry out their duties to make the park green and clean for the residents, especially the old people and the children.
          <br/>
          We hope, now that this matter has been brought to your notice, you will take immediate and appropriate action in this regard.
          <br/>
          Yours Sincerely
          <br/>

          Question 8.
          <br/>
          Answer any five of the following questions in 30-40 words each: [2 × 5 = 10]
          <br/>
          (a) Why did the elders of the village attend the last lesson?
          <br/>
          (b) What does Umberto Eco mean by the concept of ‘Interstices’ in our lives?
          <br/>
          (c) How was the make-up room in the Gemini Studios a fine example of national integration?
          <br/>
          (d) Describe the tigers created by Aunt Jennifer.
          <br/>
          (e) What would Sam have done in Galesburg for his living? Why? (The Third Level)
          <br/>
          (f) What efforts did Dr. Sadao and Hana make to save the American soldier?
          <br/>
          (g) Why did the prison officers call Evans, ‘Evans the Break’?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) The village elders were sitting in the back benches in the classroom because they were sorry that they had not gone to school for longer period. It was their way of thanking their master, M. Hamel for his forty years of faithful service and of showing their respect for their mother tongue and country that was theirs no more.
         </p>
         <p>
          (b) Umberto Eco refers to the empty spaces in our lives as Interstices. He works in these empty spaces. He says that when Mukund was coming to his place and while he was in the elevator, for him (ECO) that period of waiting was an interstice, an empty space during which he had already written an article.
         </p>
         <p>
          (c) The make-up department of the Gemini Studios gave a rare example of national integration. The department was first headed by a Bengali who was succeeded by a Maharashtrian. He was assisted by a Kannadiga from Dharwar, an Andhrite, an Indian Christian from Madras and an Anglo-Burmese. Then, there were the usual local Tamils. All this gave ample proof of national integration.
         </p>
         <p>
          (d) Aunt Jennifer’s tigers are bright topaz denizens of the forest. They symbolise strength and splendour. They are gallant, confident and fearless in sharp contrast to the meek and timid lady who created them. Through her creation of the tigers, Aunt Jennifer created an alternate world of freedom where there is no oppression.
         </p>
         <p>
          (e) When Charley used to tell Sam about Galesburg, Sam being a city boy, liked the sound of the place. When Sam disappeared and Charley got to know that Sam had brought eight hundred dollars worth of old-style currency, Charley understood that the amount would enable Sam set him up in a nice little hay, feed and grain business, that he always wished to do.
         </p>
         <p>
          (f) Dr. Sadao and Hana made a lot of efforts to save the American soldier. Dr. Sadao operated on him and he was aptly assisted by Hana, who at first washed the white man and then administered anesthesia to him while he was being operated upon. Thereafter, they nursed him and took care of him till the time he was well again.
         </p>
         <p>
          (g) Evans was quite a pleasant sort of chap with no record of violence. But he had escaped from prison thrice, and that is why the prison officers called him Evans the Break. Now that he was in Oxford Prison, the Governor was making it absolutely certain that he could not escape from there.
         </p>

          Question 10.
          <br/>
          Answer the following question in 120-150 words: [6]
          <br/>
          Why did the Tiger King decide to kill a hundred tigers? Describe the efforts he made to attain his target.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The Maharaja of Pratibandapuram, who was also known as the Tiger King tried to go against what was destined in his fate. The result was tragic and ironical. The chief astrologer had predicted that a tiger would be the cause of the king’s death and he should specially be wary of the hundredth tiger. The vain king banned hunting of the tigers in the State by everyone except himself and was able to kill ninety-nine tigers. He thought he had killed the hundredth tiger also but somehow the bullet missed its mark and the hundredth tiger survived. Then, on his son’s birthday the king bought him a wooden tiger which he felt was a perfect gift for his son. One sharp tiny sliver of the wooden tiger pierced the king’s right hand and the infection spread all over his arm causing his death. It was indeed ironical that despite killing all the tigers in his kingdom the king did finally become the victim of the hundredth tiger and the astrologer’s prediction did come true.

          Why is Antarctica the place to go to for the scientists today? 0oumey to the End of the Earth)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          A visit to Antarctica will help us to understand where we have come from and where we could possibly be heading. It will also suggest a lot of future possibilities, probably for even a million years later. By visiting Antarctica we get an opportunity to study about the future climatic changes easily and more effectively. We also come to know about the repercussions of the various environmental changes. It also gives us the realization of the appearance of the ‘future world’. The ice-cores of Antarctica hold more than half-millionyear-old carbon records which are very crucial for the study of the past, present and future of our planet. All this will also help us to understand our planet better and also give us ideas to save our planet.

          Man Saves Two Persons From Drowning
          <br/>
          By : Rohit
          <br/>
          Kanpur, 5th May, 20x x: We had gone for a picnic on the banks of the river Ganges, yesterday. The picnic was organized by the History Club of our school, ABC Shiksha Vidyalaya.
          <br/>
          We were a group of forty five students and three teachers and were enjoying ourselves. We were in the midst of fun, food and laughter when our attention was diverted by screams of frantic help. It was then that we noticed that a small boat with two persons on board was sinking into the river. Amidst the panic that prevailed among the onlookers, and it seemed out of nowhere, we saw a person jumping into the river.
         </p>
         <p>
          He appeared to be a good swimmer, because he was making powerful strokes against the strong water current. He reached the boat in no time. In the meantime some persons had gathered at the riverbank. A rope was thrown into the water and the swimmer helped the two persons on the boat reach the river bank safely with the help of the rope.
          <br/>
          It was a very commendable act on the part of the swimmer who did not think twice before putting his own life in danger and saving the lives of the two men and thus averting a tragedy.

          Wearing the school uniform gives the student an identity, pride and a feeling of discipline. Write an article in 150-200 words on, ‘Importance of wearing a uniform in school’. You are Jagan/Jagriti.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Importance of Wearing A Uniform in School
          <br/>
          By: ]agriti/Jagan
          <br/>
          Wearing the school uniform gives the student an identity, it is a badge of pride and is thus an important part of being a student. It teaches the students to dress smartly and instills a feeling of discipline among them.
          <br/>
          Wearing a uniform to school also ensures that students do not have to worry about what they should wear to school. When all the students are wearing the uniform, worrying about the way they are looking is least on their minds. There is no stress or competition to be dressed according to the latest trend or wearing a reputed brand of clothing.
         </p>
         <p>
          While they are wearing their school uniform, the students feel bound to obey and follow certain rules as the uniform helps them to realize that they are part of a group. The uniform gives them a sense of belonging, which in turn enables them to take up responsibility for their actions. Moreover, uniform is a reminder to all school going children that they are students and their main aim is to study and learn.
          <br/>
          Thus, uniforms in school exemplify a student’s respect for his school, and when every one is wearing the same dress, students can focus on essential issues and for the purpose they go to school.

          Question 8.
          <br/>
          Answer any five of the following questions in 30-40 words each: [2 × 5 = 10]
          <br/>
          (a) How is the mother tongue important to a person? What does M. Hamel, the teacher say about it?
          <br/>
          (c) How bad were the living conditions in which Mukesh and his family survived?
          <br/>
          (d) Why has the poet mentioned ‘merry children spilling out of their homes’ in the poem? (My Mother at Sixty-six)
          <br/>
          (e) How is Antarctica different from the place you live in?
          <br/>
          (f) On seeing Roger Skunk again with a very bad smell, how did the little animals react first and then later on when, he had lost it?
          <br/>
          (g) “I felt like sinking to the floor”, said Zitkala-Sa. When did she feel so and why?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) When people are enslaved, as long as they hold on to their mother tongue, it is as if they have the key to their prison. M. Hamel tells the class that their problem is that they put off learning till the next day and will thus give the Germans the right to tell them that they only pretend to be Frenchmen, because they can neither speak nor – write their own language.
         </p>
         <p>
          (c) Mukesh and his family lived in a house within the stinking lanes choked with garbage. Their crude shelter was a half built shack in the vicinity of houses with crumbling walls, wobbly doors, no windows and crowded with families of humans and animals in the primeval state.
         </p>
         <p>
          (d) The merry children spilling out of their homes are symbolic of happiness and energy. Their image presents a sharp contrast to the poet’s aging mother. The mention of the merry children helps us to understand the process of old age that is associated with death and decay.
         </p>
         <p>
          (e) Antarctica is devoid of any human markers. There are no trees, billboards or buildings. One loses all earthly sense of perspective and time here. One can see a range of microscopic to huge creatures, midges and mites to blue whales and icebergs as big as countries. There is an unusual 24-hour summer light which stretches for many days.
         </p>
         <p>
          (f) The other animals would run away because Roger Skunk smelt very bad. He would stand alone and tears would fall from his eyes. When he had lost his bad smell the other animals gathered around him as he smelled so good. They played games and laughed together all afternoon.
         </p>
         <p>
          (g) Zitkala-Sa felt like sinking to the floor when her blanket was stripped from her shoulders. She was wearing rather tight-fitting clothes and the blanket had covered her immodest-looking dress. So, she felt very embarrassed without the blanket.

          Question 9.

          Answer the following question in 120-150 ivords: [6]
          <br/>
          How did Douglas develop a fear of water?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          When Douglas was three or four years old, his father had taken him to the beach in California. As he and his father had stood together in the surf, the waves had knocked him down and swept over him. He was buried in water. His breath was gone and he was frightened. Then, when he was about ten or eleven years old and had decided to learn to swim, he had gone to the YMCA pool. There an eighteen year old boy picked him up and tossed him into the deep end of the pool. After this incident he never went back to the pool. He developed a fear of water and avoided it whenever he could. Even when he went wading or boating in water, the terror that had seized him during these experiences would come back and take possession of him completely. His legs would become paralysed and icy horror would grab his heart.
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          How did Civil Disobedience triumph at Motihari? (Indigo)
          <br/>
          Gandhiji took up the cause of the indigo sharecroppers at Champaran. He fought against the injustice of the cruel British landlords who extorted money from the poor sharecroppers. Gandhiji collected all the facts and met the Commissioner. The commissioner tried to threaten Gandhiji and advised him to leave from there. But Gandhiji was undeterred. He decided to launch a peaceful ‘satyagraha’ and non-violent movement. This led to spontaneous demonstrations in Motihari.
         </p>
         <p>
          Thousands of peasants challenged the Britishers and the government was baffled. Despite earlier hesitations, the prominent lawyers declared their unconditional support to Gandhiji. Finally, Gandhiji’s peaceful and non-violent civil disobedience bore the desired results. The indigo share-croppers at Champaran secured justice and the landlords agreed to refund 25 per cent of the compensation money.
         </p>
         <p>
          Add : The British government was baffled when their power was challenged by the Indians. Even though Gandhiji pleaded guilty, the Lieutenant Governor ordered the case against him to be dropped. Thus, civil disobedience triumphed at Motihari.
