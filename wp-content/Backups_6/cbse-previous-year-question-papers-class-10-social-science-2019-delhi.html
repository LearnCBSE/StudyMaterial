          Question 1.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          In the economic sphere, ‘Liberalism’ stood for the freedom of markets and the abolition of state-imposed restrictions on the movement of goods and capital. Duties were levied according to the weight or measurement of the goods which were different for different states. Liberalisation meant reduction of custom , duties and removal of these quotas. A unified economic territory allowing the unhindered movement of goods, people and capital was the need of the hour. In 1834, Zollverein, a customs union abolished tariff barriers and reduced the number of currencies from over thirty to two. This was the main concept of Liberalisation prevalent in the 19th century in Europe.
          <br/>
          OR
          <br/>

Forced labour for construction were of irrigation facilities to improve rice cultivation was used and infrastructure and transportation facilities were developed for the export of agricultural produce.
          <br/>
          Infrastructure projects were undertaken for the transportation of goods for trade, movement of military garrison and to establish control over the entire region.

          <br/>
          OR
          <br/>
          How had translation process of novels into regional languages helped to spread their popularity?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Buddhist missionaries from China introduced hand printing technology in Japan around 768-770 AD.
          <br/>
          OR
          <br/>
          English novels translated into regional Indian languages, were not very popular as the Indian people could not relate to the stories or characters in those novels. People wanted novels that narrated stories close to their own lives and was set in their own geographic location.

          How is cement industry responsible for land degradation?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Over-irrigation is responsible for land degradation due to water logging leading to increase in salinity and alkalinity in the soil. This and continuous use of land over a long period of time without taking appropriate measures to conserve and manage land has resulted in land degradation in Punjab.
          <br/>
          OR
          <br/>
          Mineral processing like grinding of limestone for cement industry generates heavy amount of dust which is released in the atmosphere. Later, it settles down in the surrounding areas which retards the process of infiltration of water into the soil. This is how land gets degraded due to Cement industries.

          How can democratic reforms be carried out by political conscious citizens? [1]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The most important concern should be to increase and improve the quality of political participation by ordinary citizens. Politically conscious citizens are aware about their duties and rights as entitled by the constitution, this gives them an upper hand for they are able to judge between right and wrong. They are also able to spread this awareness around by holding discussions or generally through the word of mouth and help in formation of Public opinion. Politically aware citizens have better knowledge of diplomacy and world politics.

          <br/>
          Why do banks or lenders demand collateral against loans? [1]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Collateral is something of value – an asset or property that the borrower pledges when getting a loan, such as land, building, vehicle etc.. This is used as a guarantee by the lender until the loan is repaid. If the borrower fails to repay the loan, the lender is free to sell the collateral and reimburse his amount. Thus collateral acts like a guarantee against loan.

          Through a return to monarchy, Napoleon had, no doubt, destroyed democracy in France, but in the administrative field he had incorporated revolutionary principles in order to make the whole system more rational and efficient. In the Dutch Republic, Switzerland, Italy and Germany, Napoleon simplified administrative divisions, abolished the feudal system and freed peasants from serfdom and manorial dues. In the towns too, guild restrictions were removed. Transport and communication systems were improved. Peasants, artisans, workers and new businessmen enjoyed a new-found freedom. Businessmen and small-scale producers of goods, in particular, began to realise that uniform law, standardised weights and measures, and a common national currency would facilitate the movement and exchange of goods and capital from one region to another.

          How had novels been easily available to the masses in Europe during nineteenth century? Explain with examples.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          From AD 594 onwards, books in China were printed by rubbing paper – also invented there against the inked surface of woodblocks. The imperial state in China was, for a very long time, the major producer of printed material. China possessed a huge bureaucratic system which recruited its personnel through civil service examinations.
         </p>
         <p>
          Textbooks for this examination were printed in vast numbers under the sponsorship of the imperial state. From the sixteenth century, the number of examination candidates went up and that increased the volume of print. By the seventeenth century, as urban culture bloomed in China, the uses of print diversified. Reading increasingly became a leisure activity. Women, revolutionaries, poets and even merchants used print in everyday life.

          “Water scarcity may be an outcome of a large and growing population in India.” Analyse the statement. [3 × 1 = 3]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          A large population requires more water not only for domestic use but also to produce more food. Hence, to facilitate higher food-grain production, water resources are being over-exploited to expand irrigated areas for dry-season agriculture. Irrigated agriculture is the largest consumer of water. Post independent India witnessed intensive industrialization and urbanization, creating vast opportunities for us. Today, large industrial houses are as commonplace as the industrial units of many MNCs.
         </p>
         <p>
          The ever-increasing number of industries has made matters worse by exerting pressure on existing fresh water resources. Industries, apart from being heavy users of water, also require power to run them. Much of this energy comes from hydroelectric power. Most of these have their own groundwater pumping devices to meet their water needs, which results in fragile water resources being overexploited. This has caused their depletion in several of these cities.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Women still lag much behind men because men are in authority over women in all aspects of the society. The evidences are :
          <br/>
          (i) Political participation of women in India very is less when compared to other countries. Only 10% of the total members in Lok sabha are women. The situation is worse in state assemblies where only 5% of the total members are women. The Women reservation bill to encourage the participation of women is still pending since past decade.
         </p>
         <p>
          (ii) Women have entered into every field but they are still paid less than their male counterparts. The proportion of women in highly paid jobs is still less and studies have showed that on average they work more than men and yet paid less. Although the Equal Remuneration Act provides provision for equal wages should be paid for equal work.
         </p>
         <p>
          (iii) The literacy rate amongst the women is also low as compared to men. The literacy rate is only 54% as compared to 76% among the men. This shows the discrimination women have to face. Men are still considered to be the head of the family. A lot of dowry issues still emerge everywhere. Men are known to dominate women in every field using strength as a factor. Women are made to stay quiet even in cases of rapes, betrayal etc.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Democracies that follow a federal system all over the world tend to have two kinds of political parties : parties that are present in only one of the federal units and parties that are present in several or all units of the national level. Every party in the country has to register with the Election Commission. Parties that get a unique symbol and some other special facilities are ‘recognized’ by the Election Commission for this purpose. That is why these parties are called, ‘recognized political parties’. A party that secures at least six percent of the total votes in an election to the Legislative Assembly of a State and wins at least two seats is recognized as a ‘State Party.’ A party that secures at least six percent of the total votes in Lok Sabha elections or Assembly elections in four states and wins at least four seats in the Lok Sabha is recognized as a ‘National party.’

          Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the market value of the final goods and services produced during a year within the domestic territory of a country. While calculating GDP, final goods and services are counted to avoid the problem of double counting.
          <br/>
          For e.g. a farmer sold wheat to flour mill for ₹ 10 per kg. The mill grinds the wheat and sold the flour to a biscuit company for ₹ 12 per kg. The biscuit company uses the flour, sugar and butter to make 5 biscuit packets. It sold the biscuit to the consumer at ₹ 15 per biscuit packet. Here biscuits are the final goods that are purchased by the consumer. Wheat and Wheat flour are the intermediate goods used in the production of final good. The value of ₹ 75 already includes the value of flour ₹ 12. Hence, only the value of final goods and services are included in GDP.

         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           The ‘Depressed Classes Association’ was in favour of seperate electorate for dalits.
          </li>
          <li>
           It uplifted the dalits against the dominance of upper caste hindus.
          </li>
          <li>
           It gave the depressed classes, reserved seats in provincial and central legislative councils in proportion to their population.
          </li>
          <li>
           The ‘Depressed Classes Association’ enhanced the dignity of marginalised section of society such as SC, ST, OBC.

         <p>
          In the countryside, rich peasant communities – like the Patidars of Gujarat and the Jats of Uttar Pradesh – were active in the movement. Being producers of commerical crops, they were very hard hit by the trade depression and falling prices. These rich peasants became enthusiastic supporters of the Civil Disobedience Movement, organizing their communities, and at times forcing reluctant members, to participate in the boycott programmes. For them, the fight for Swaraj was a struggle against high revenues.
         </p>
         <p>
          Poor peasants wanted the unpaid rent to the landlord to be remitted. They joined a variety of radical movements, often led by Socialists and Communists. Apprehensive of raising issues that might upset the rich peasants and landlords, the Congress was unwilling to support ‘no rent’ campaigns in most places. So, the relationship between the poor peasants and the Congress remained uncertain.

          As the swadeshi movement gathered momentum, nationalists mobilised people to boycott foreign cloth. Industrial groups organised themselves to protect their collective interests, pressurising the government to increase tariff protection and grant other concessions. From 1906, moreover, the export of Indian yam to China declined since produce from Chinese and Japanese mills flooded the Chinese market. So industrialists in India began shifting from yam to cloth production. Cotton piece goods production in India doubled between 1900 and 1912. Yet, till the First World War, industrial growth was slow.

          The war created a dramatically new situation. With British mills busy with war production to meet the needs of the army, Manchester imports into India declined. Suddenly, Indian mills had a vast home market to supply As the war prolonged, Indian factories were called upon to supply war needs: jute bags, cloth for army uniforms, tents and leather boots, horse and mule saddles and a host of other items. New factories were set up and old ones ran multiple shifts. Many new workers were employed and everyone was made to work longer hours. Over the war years, industrial production boomed.

          Question 21.
          <br/>
          How are industries responsible for environmental degradation in India? Explain with examples. [5 × 1 = 5]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Industries are responsible for environmental degradation in India by following ways:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           The presence of high proportion of undesirable gases such as sulphur dioxide, and carbon monoxide is a product of these industries. They affect the environment majorly.
          </li>
          <li>
           Industrial and construction activities, machinery and factory equipment, generators, saws and pneumatic and electric drills also make a lot of noise in the environment.
          </li>
          <li>
           The main culprits in this regard are paper, pulp, chemical and textile industries that let out dyes, detergents, acids, salts and heavy metals etc. with carbon, plastic and rubber into the water bodies.
          </li>
          <li>
           The air-borne waste particle contains both solid and liquid particles like dust, sprays, mist and smoke which pollutes the environment.

          Question 22.
          <br/>
          “Roadways still have an edge over railways in India.” Support the statement with examples. [5 × 1 = 5]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Roadways still have more importance than Railways due to the following features:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           The construction cost of roads is much less than that of railways lines.
          </li>
          <li>
           Roads can traverse comparatively more dissected areas and undulating topography.
          </li>
          <li>
           Roads can negotiate higher gradients of slopes and can traverse mountains such as the Himalayas.
          </li>
          <li>
           Road transport provides door to door service.
          </li>
          <li>
           Road transport is also used as a feeder to other modes of transport such as they provide link between railway stations, air and seaports.

          Power-sharing has emerged as a strong substitute to the idea of undivided political power, which believed in giving power to one person or group of people located in one place. The core principle of power sharing is that people are the source of all political powers. Common forms of power-sharing are:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Vertical division of power: The sharing of power can be done at the different levels of the govt. – a central govt, for the entire country and governments at the provincial or regional level. This type is usually called the federal government.
          </li>
          <li>
           Horizontal division of power: In this form, the power is divided among different organs of govt, such as the legislature, the executive and the judiciary. It places different organs of the government at the same level.
          </li>
          <li>
           Power is also shared among different social groups such as religious and linguistic groups eg: community govt.
          </li>
          <li>
           Various power-sharing arrangement can also be seen in the way political parties, pressure groups and movements control or influence those in power.

          Question 7.
          <br/>
          Explain the importance of ‘collateral’. [1]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Collateral is an asset, land, vehicle property or something valuable that the borrower pledges as a guarantee in return of the money he borrows from the lender. If the borrower fails to repay the money borrowed, the lender has the right to confiscate the collateral. Hence, its main importance is that it ensures the repayment of credit.

         <p>
          Question 11.
          <br/>
          Analyse the importance of ‘rainwater harvesting.’ [3]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          It is a technique of increasing the recharge of groundwater by collecting and storing rainwater by constructing structures, such as dug wells, percolation pits and check dams.
         </p>
         <p>
          In most cases, the harvested water is usually redirected to storage tanks, cistern or reservoirs. First and foremost, the collection offers better and efficient utilization of energy resource. It is important because potable water is usually not renewable.
          <br/>
          The overall expenses used in setting up harvesting methods are much cheaper compared to other purifying or pumping means. Its maintenance is feasible on the economic front as it does not require deep pockets.
         </p>
         <p>
          Harvesting allows the collection of large amounts of rainwater. Rainwater is usually free from harmful chemicals, which makes it ideal for irrigation purposes.
          <br/>
          Another important advantage is that it reduces the demand for potable water. It is important especially in areas with low water levels. Rainwater harvesting, thus, is considered a very reliable way to conserve water.

          Question 14.
          <br/>
          Explain the three components of ‘political party.’ [3 × 1 = 3]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) Leader: A leader is the one who takes the major decisions of the party and his decision is the supreme command for the party. He contests elections and performs the administrative job.
         </p>
         <p>
          (ii) Active Members: Another component of a political party are the active members who contest elections for the party and are elected as representatives. They are the ones, who
          <br/>
          climb the ladder from being the follower and become the assistants of the leaders to gain knowledge about politics.
         </p>
         <p>
          (iii) Followers: The last one is the followers who support a political party and in elections make their party victorious. They are simply the ardent followers of the leaders and work under the able guidance of the active members.

          Question 21.
          <br/>
          Explain with examples any five factors that are responsible for the industrial location. [5 × 1 = 5]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Factors responsible for industrial location are as follows:
          <br/>
          (i) Availability of raw material is one major basic factor for the location of any industry, e.g. jute mills in West bengal are concentrated close to the source of raw material.
         </p>
         <p>
          (ii) Climate also plays a major role in the concentration of industries at a certain place. Favourable weather conditions required for the growth &amp; harvesting of the crop causes its industries to be located in certain places.
          <br/>
          For e.g. cotton textile industry are generally found in Maharastra and Gujarat because of favourable climatic conditions.
         </p>
         <p>
          (iii) Availability of capital and other infrastructural facilities is also one reason. It is due to the availability of capital that Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai became big industrial centres. These places have banking facilities and well developed infrastructure.
         </p>
         <p>
          (iv) Availability of both skilled and unskilled labour also governs the location of an industry. Cheap and abundant labour is one necessary condition which affects the location of an industry.
         </p>
         <p>
          (v) The entire process of manufacturing is futile until the finished products reach the market and the consumers. Thus, the availability of ‘ a good market near by also benefits the owners.

          <br/>
          Explain any five effects of globalization. [5 × 1 = 5]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Globalisation creates and greater competition among producers. Both local and foreign producers have been of advantage to consumers, there is greater choice before these consumers who now enjoy improved quality and lower prices for several products. As a result, these people today, enjoy much higher standards of living than was possible earlier.
          <br/>
          MNCs have increased their investments in India over the past 20 years, which means investing in India has been beneficial for them. In these industries and services, new jobs have been created. Also, local companies supplying raw materials, etc. to these industries have prospered.
         </p>
         <p>
          Several of the top Indian companies have been able to benefit from the increased competition. They have invested in newer technology and production methods and raised their production standards. Globalization has enabled some large Indian companies to emerge as multinational companies themselves. Globalization has also created new opportunities for companies providing services, particularly those involving IT.

          Question 11.
          <br/>
          Analyse the impact of ‘water scarcity.’ [3]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Water is one of the most important requirements for agriculture and also for livestock. Water is needed for irrigating the crops; thus, water scarcity immediately leads to the loss of crops. The scarcity of water damages the already sown crops. Livestock . is affected as the fodder (animal feed) production is also decreased manifolds due to water scarcity. The domestic farms need water for its proper maintenance. So, water scarcity is a threat to both these sectors. Water scarcity directly affects human beings and animals.
         </p>
         <p>
          Absence of potable water for drinking and other purposes causes a lot of diseases and problems to human beings. This hinders their daily routines and they are unable to discharge their daily duties. Without access to clean water, there is no way one can avail proper sanitation facilities. Access to quality water is fundamental to better living standard &amp; economic growth. Absence of that lowers the living standards of the country. Natural landscapes suffer the most because of water scarcity as it contributes to desertification, loss of plants and death of wildlife.

          Question 14.
          <br/>
          Explain any three functions of opposition political parties. [3 × 1 = 3]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The Opposition’s main role is to question the government of the day and hold them accountable to the public. In the legislature, the Opposition Party has a major role and must act to discourage the party in power from acting against the interests of the country and the common man. They hustle to present themselves as a suitable alternative government.
          <br/>
          Following are the three functions of opposition parties:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           They question the ruling government and make them accountable to the public.
          </li>
          <li>
           Their role is to ensure that the government should not take any step which is against the interest of the public.
          </li>
          <li>
           Their duty is to check and ensure that the action of the ruling party is for the benefit of the masses and to support the government in such things.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          They, thus, facilitate the formation of public opinion and are a way in which the schemes of government are checked and communicated to the public.
         </p>
         <p>
          Question 21.
          <br/>
          Explain five types of ‘industrial pollution.’ [5 × 1 = 5]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Industrial pollution creates environmental degradation in the following ways:
          <br/>
          Due to the release of undesirable gases like sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide, airborne particulate matter containing smoke, dust and spray mist, toxic gases by burning fossil fuels in the industries, Air pollution is caused. Release of these pollutants also causes Acid Rain. Thus, chemicals pollute the atmosphere and cause life-threatening diseases. This also affects monuments, buildings and animals.
         </p>
         <p>
          Water pollution is caused by organic and inorganic industrial wastes discharged into the rivers, liquid wastes produced by chemical and textile industry, tanneries, petroleum refineries, electroplating industries and metallic pesticides etc. solid wastes like fly ash, phosphor-gypsum and slags produced by iron and steel industries. Water pollution leads to loss of rich aquatic life and flora-fauna. This causes water scarcity as well. This also causes diseases like typhoid and cholera.
         </p>
         <p>
          All the pollutants that cause water pollution, along with wastes from nuclear power plants are responsible for land pollution. Water and land pollution are closely related. All the liquid and solid affluents, if not being disposed off into the rivers, goes directly into the soil and degrade the land areas.
          <br/>
          All the unwanted sounds caused due to industrial and construction activities, machinery, generators and drilling activities create irritants and are a source of stress.
         </p>
         <p>
