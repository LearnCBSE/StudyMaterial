           Answer:
          </strong>
          By environment, we mean our surroundings, which have an impact on our lives. It is the sum total of the surroundings and resources, including both biotic resources (i.e., living creatures such as plants and animals) and abiotic resources (i.e., non-living things, such as air, water and land) that affect our existence and quality of life. However, because of the rapid increase in population and industrialisation, the excessive use of resources has resulted in their degradation and depletion. Also, the discharge of harmful substances into the environment has contributed towards pollution. Environmental pollution can be classified into the following four types.

           Answer:
          </strong>
          Business ethics refers to the values and principles that govern the behaviour of individuals in an organisation such that the business activities are desirable from the viewpoint of society. The main purpose of business ethics is to guide managers and other employees to perform their jobs in a manner that is socially acceptable.
          <br/>
          The following are some of the elements of business ethics.
         </p>

          <li>
           <strong>
            Top management commitment
           </strong>
           : Top-level officers, such as CEO’s and senior managers, must strongly follow the ethical codes and guide the other employees in adopting such behaviour.

          <li>
           <strong>
            Publication of a code:
           </strong>
           Enterprises must clearly define the ethical code of conduct, which would include quality standards, laws governing production and health and safety standards for the employees.
          </li>
          <li>
           <strong>
            Establishment of compliance mechanism:
           </strong>
           In addition to standards, an enterprise must also devise a mechanism through which compliance with the code of conduct can be measured.
          </li>
          <li>
           <strong>
            Involvement of employees at all levels:
           </strong>
           The successful implementation of ethical standards requires the involvement of all the employees at all levels.
          </li>
          <li>
           <strong>
            Measurement of results:
           </strong>
           Although it is difficult to measure the end results of implementation of ethical standards, the top management should take steps to measure the degree of compliance with the ethical codes.

          <strong>
           (a) Air Pollution:
          </strong>
          This kind of pollution is caused by the emission of harmful gases into the atmosphere. Smoke and chemicals emitted by factories and vehicles degrade the air quality and causes air pollution.
          <br/>
          <strong>
           (b) Water Pollution:
          </strong>
          Discharge of industrial and household wastes into rivers, streams or lakes causes degradation of the water quality. Over time, the increase in water pollution often results in the deaths of several animals and poses serious threats to human beings.

          <strong>
           (c) Land Pollution:
          </strong>

          The primary objective of any business enterprise is profit maximization. This is because profit acts as a measure of success and at the same time is the main source of income for an enterprise. Also, profits are often used to finance the expansion projects of a business enterprise. However, it is argued that business enterprises are not merely profit-making entities. They are considered as social institutions, too, as they are created by society. As every business makes use of society’s resources in terms of human and physical capital, it cannot work in isolation from society. Its operations are affected by social problems such as unemployment and poverty. Thus, a need arises to create a balance between the business interests and social interests of a business enterprise, such that it can grow by doing the maximum good to society. Hence, we can say that a business enterprise is a social institution and not merely a profit-making entity. In this regard, the following are some of the responsibilities that must be

           Question 4. Why do the enterprises need to adopt pollution control measures?

          <br/>
          <strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
           Answer:
          </strong>
          Pollution control is necessary for preserving and improving the quality of environmental resources. As business activities such as production, transportation, distribution, storage and consumption are often assumed to cause the maximum destruction to society’s resources, a need arises for adopting pollution control measures. Following are some of the reasons why business enterprises need to adopt pollution control measures,
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           <strong>
            Reduced health hazards:
           </strong>
           Pollutants in the environment cause diseases such as cancers and respiratory problems. Thus, pollution control measures will not only
           <br/>
           help in reducing the incidence of diseases but also help people enjoy a good and healthy life.
          </li>
          <li>
           <strong>
            Reduced risk of liability:
           </strong>
           Enterprises are often held responsible for polluting the environment and are asked to compensate. Pollution control helps in reducing the risk of such liabilities.
          </li>
          <li>
           <strong>
            Cost savings:
           </strong>
           Efficient pollution control mechanisms help in reducing the cost of waste disposal and the cost of cleaning up production plants. This in turn helps firms to reduce their costs.
          </li>
          <li>
           <strong>
            Improved public image:
           </strong>
           An increase in the education level has made people more aware about environmental problems. As a result, they have started realising the need to protect the environment. Thus, business enterprises which adopt pollution control measures enjoy a good reputation in the society.
          </li>
          <li>
           <strong>
            Other social benefits:
           </strong>
           Pollution control helps a firm to enjoy various other benefits such as cleaner surroundings, better quality of life for its employees as well as owners and increased availability of good quality resources.
          </li>

          <strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
           Answer:
          </strong>
          Various business activities such as production, transportation and consumption of goods often result in over exploitation of natural resources. Thus, it is the responsibility of every business enterprise to control discharge of pollutants into the environment. The following steps can be taken by the business enterprises to control pollution.
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           <strong>
            Control by top managers:
           </strong>
           The top management of every organisation should be committed to creating, developing and maintaining a work culture conducive to environmental protection and pollution prevention.
          </li>
          <li>
           <strong>
            Control by employees
           </strong>
           : Employees at all the levels of an organisation should be committed to keeping the environment clean and protected.
          </li>
          <li>
           <strong>
            Better technology:
           </strong>
           Enterprises should employ good and superior technologies of production and use scientific techniques for waste disposal. This will ensure environmental protection and pollution control.
          </li>
          <li>
           <strong>
            Follow rules:
           </strong>
           Enterprises must conform to the rules and regulations enacted by the government for the prevention of environmental pollution.
          </li>
          <li>
           <strong>
            Increased awareness:
           </strong>
           By conducting workshops and training programmes, business enterprises must make an effort to spread awareness among its employees of the need to conserve the environment.
          </li>
          <li>
           <strong>
            Assessment programmes:
           </strong>
           An efficient mechanism for the periodic assessment of pollution control programmes may also be adopted, in order to weigh their costs and benefits.

           Question 6. Explain the various elements of business ethics.

          <strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
           Answer:
          </strong>
          Business ethics can be defined as the code of conduct that a business must follow, such that it takes up only those activities that are desirable from the viewpoint of society. The purpose of business ethics is to guide managers and other employees in an organisation in performing their jobs in a manner that is socially acceptable. Business ethics should be followed in the day-to-day working of a business enterprise. The following are some of the elements of business ethics.
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           <strong>
            Commitment by top management:
           </strong>
           Top-level officers, such as the CEO’s and other higher level managers, must sincerely follow the ethical code of conduct. They should also guide other employees in their organisation in adopting the code.
          </li>
          <li>
           <strong>
            Publication of a code:
           </strong>
           An enterprise must clearly define the ethical code of conduct to be followed in the organisation. The code should include quality standards for work, laws governing production and employee’s health and safety standards.
          </li>
          <li>
           <strong>
            Establishment of compliance mechanism:
           </strong>
           In addition to setting performance standards, an enterprise must also devise a mechanism through which it can measure the actions of individual employees. This should be done in order to confirm whether the ethical standards are being met.
          </li>
          <li>
           <strong>
            Involvement of employees at all levels:
           </strong>
           The successful implementation of ethical standards depends to a large extent on the involvement of employees at different levels. This is because it is the employees who actually implement the ethical codes.
          </li>
          <li>
           <strong>
            Measurement of results:
           </strong>
           Although it is difficult to measure the end results of implementation of ethical standards, the top management should take steps to monitor compliance. Also, it must take serious action against any unethical behaviour in the organisation.
          </li>

          <strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
           Answer:
          </strong>
          Business ethics can be defined as the code of conduct that a business must follow, such that it takes up only those activities that are desirable from the viewpoint of society. The purpose of business ethics is to guide managers and other employees in an organisation in performing their jobs in a manner that is socially acceptable.
          <br/>
          The following are some of the elements of business ethics.
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Top-level officers, such as the CEO’s and other higher level managers, must sincerely follow the ethical code of conduct. They should also guide other employees in their organisation in adopting the code.
          </li>
          <li>
           An enterprise must clearly define the ethical code of conduct to be followed in the organisation. The code should include quality standards for work, laws governing production and employee’s health and safety standards.
          </li>
          <li>
           In addition to setting performance standards, an enterprise must also devise a mechanism through which it can measure the actions of individual employees. This should be done in order to confirm whether the ethical standards are being met.
          </li>
          <li>
           The successful implementation of ethical standards depends to a large extent on the involvement of employees at different levels. This is because it is the employees who actually implement the ethical codes.
          </li>
          <li>
           Although it is difficult to measure the end results of implementation of ethical standards, the top management should take steps to monitor compliance. Also, it must take serious action against any unethical behaviour in the organisation.

          Public relations is a potent tool for shaping consumer perception and building a company’s image.

          <strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
           Answer:
          </strong>
          Social responsibility of business towards government’s regulatory bodies or agencies is quite sensitive from the license point of view. If permission is not granted or revoked abruptly, it can result in huge losses to an organization. Therefore, compliance in this regard is necessary.
          <br/>
          Furthermore, a business must also function within the demarcation of rules and policies as formulated from time to time by the government of state or nation. It should respect laws and abide by all established regulations while performing within the jurisdiction of state.
          <br/>
          Some examples of activities a business can do in this regard:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Paying fair taxes on time,
          </li>
          <li>
           Following labor, environmental and other laws, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
           Seeking permissions wherever necessary,
          </li>
          <li>
           Licensing an organization,
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          If laws are respected and followed, it creates goodwill of business in the eyes of authorities. Overall, if a government is satisfied it will make favourable commercial policies, which will ultimately open new opportunities and finally benefit the organization sooner or later.

          Social responsibility of business towards its employees: It is important because they are the wheels of an organization. Without their support, the commercial institution simply can’t function or operate.
          <br/>
          If a business takes care of the needs of its human resource (for e.g. office staff, employees, workers, etc.) wisely, it will boost the motivation and working spirit within an organization. A happy employee usually gives his best to the organization in terms of quality labour and timely output than an unsatisfied one. A pleasant working environment helps in improving the efficiency and productivity of working people. A

          good remuneration policy attracts new talented professionals who can further contribute to its growth and expansion.Thus, if personnel are satisfied, then they will work together very hard and aid in increasing the production, sales and profit.

          Social responsibility of business towards its consumers or customers: It matters a lot from sales and profit point of view. Its success is directly dependent on their level of satisfaction. Higher their rate of satisfaction, greater is the chances to succeed.
          <br/>
          If a business rolls out good-quality products and/or delivers better quality services that too at reasonable prices, then it is natural to attract lots of customers. If the quality- price ratio is maintained well and consumers get worth for their money spends, this will surely satisfy them. In the long run, customer loyalty and retention will grow, and this will ultimately lead to profitability.

           Business enterprises exist to make profits by providing goods and services to consumers. Thus, we can say that their long-term growth prospect depends not only on their profits but also on how efficiently they serve the society. Therefore, taking up social responsibilities supports the existence and growth of a business enterprise.

            Avoidance of government intervention:

           </strong>
           The most successful corporate social responsibility programmes integrate these two types of CSR together to show a true commitment to a cause. For example, a company that uses sustainable materials in their products, donates financial resources to environmental causes, and allows employees to take paid time off for volunteering at environmental charities would be showing a true commitment to the environment that goes beyond any single CSR initiative.

           <strong>
            Social media visibility:
           </strong>
           One of the reasons that corporations should have visible CSR campaigns is due to the importance and prevalence of social media. Corporations that want to protect their brand understand that social media is an integral part of public perception. When a corporation exercises social responsibility in the form of fund raising or setting up employee giving programmes, using social media to promote these actions helps to create a positive branding environment and it is a great way to engage with your audience on a deeper level that goes beyond your products or services.

            Government relations:

           Corporations that put an emphasis oh corporate social responsibility typically have an easier experience when dealing with politicians and government regulators. In contrast, businesses that present a reckless disregard for social responsibility tend to find themselves finding off various inquiries and probes, often brought on*at the insistence of public service organizations. The more positive the public perception is that a corporation takes social responsibility seriously, the less likely it is that activist groups will launch public campaigns and demand government inquiries against it.

            Building a positive workplace environment:

           Finally, one of the greatest benefits of promoting social responsibility in the workplace is the positive environment you build for your employees. When employees and management feel they are working for a company that has a true conscience, they will likely be more enthusiastic and engaged in their jobs. This can build a sense of community and teamwork which brings everyone together and leads to happier, more productive employees.

Corporate Social Responsibility is the continuing commitment by business to behave ethically and contribute to economic development while improving the quality of life of the workforce and their families as well as of the local community and society at large. The same report gave some evidence of the different perceptions of what this should mean from a number of different societies across the world.

          Social responsibility of government towards different groups is explained below:
         </p>

          <li>
           <strong>
            Shareholders or investors:
           </strong>
           Social responsibility of business towards its shareholders or investors is most important of all other obligations.
           <br/>
           If a business satisfies its funders, they are likely to invest more money in a project. As a result, more funds will flow in and the same can be utilised to modernize, expand and diversify the existing activities on a larger scale. Happy financiers can fulfill the rising demand of funds needed for its growth and expansion.
          </li>
          <li>
           <strong>
            Personnel:
           </strong>
           Social responsibility of business towards its personnel is important because they are the wheels of an organization. Without their support, the commercial institution simply can’t function or operate.
           <br/>
           If a business takes care of the needs of its human resource (for e.g. of office staff, employees, workers, etc.) wisely, it will boost the motivation and working spirit within an organization. A happy employee usually gives his best to the organization in terms of quality labour and timely output than an unsatisfied one. A pleasant working environment helps in improving the efficiency and productivity of working people. A good remuneration policy attracts new talented professionals who can further contribute in its growth and expansion.
           <br/>
           Thus, if personnel are satisfied, then they will work together very hard and aid in increasing the production, sales and profit.
          </li>
          <li>
           <strong>
            Consumers or customers:
           </strong>
           Social responsibility of business towards its consumers or customers matters a lot from sales and profit point of view. Its success is directly dependent on their level of satisfaction. Higher their rate of satisfaction greater is the chances to succeed.
           <br/>
           If a business rolls out good-quality products and/or delivers better quality services that too at reasonable prices, then it is natural to attract lots of customers. If the quality-price ratio is maintained well and consumers get worth for their money spends, this will surely satisfy them. In the long run, customer loyalty and retention will grow, and this will ultimately lead to profitability.
          </li>
          <li>
           <strong>
            Government:
           </strong>
           Social responsibility of business towards government’s regulatory bodies or agencies is quite sensitive from the license’s point of view. If permission is not granted or revoked abruptly, it can result in huge losses to an organization. Therefore, compliance in this regard is necessary.
           <br/>
           Furthermore, a business must also function within the demarcation of rules and policies as formulated from time to time by the government of state or nation. It should respect laws and abide by all established regulations while performing within the jurisdiction of state.
           <br/>
           Some examples of activities a business can do in this regard:
           <br/>
           (a) Licensing an organization,
           <br/>
           (b) Seeking permissions wherever necessary,
           <br/>
           (c) Paying fair taxes on time,
           <br/>
           (d) Following labour, environmental and other laws, etc.
           <br/>
           (e) If laws are respected and followed, it creates goodwill of business in the eyes of authorities. Overall, if a government is satisfied it will make favourable commercial policies, which will ultimately open new opportunities and finally benefit the organization sooner or later.
           <br/>
           Therefore, satisfaction of government and local administrative bodies is equally important for legal continuation of business.

            Local community:
           </strong>
           Social responsibility of business towards the local community of its established area is significant. This is essential for smooth functioning of its activities without any agitations or hindrances.
           <br/>
           A business has a responsibility towards the local community besides which it is established and operates from. Industrial activities carried out in a local area affect the lives of many people who reside in and around it. So, as a compensation for their hardship, an organization must do something or other to alleviate the intensity of suffering.
           <br/>
           (a) As a service to the local community, a business can build.
           <br/>
           (b) A trust-run hospital or health centre for local patients.
           <br/>
           (c) A primary and secondary school for local children.
           <br/>
           (d) A diploma and degree college for local students.
           <br/>
           (e) An employment centre for recruiting skilled local people, etc.
           <br/>
           Such activities to some extent may satisfy the people that make local community and hence their changes of agitations against an establishment are greatly reduced. This will ensure the longevity of a business in the long run.

            Environment:
           </strong>
           Social responsibility of business with respect to its surrounding environment can’t be sidelined at any cost. It must show a keen interest to safeguard and not harm the vitality of the nature. A business must take enough care to check that its- activities don’t create a negative impact on the environment. For example, dumping of industrial wastes without proper treatment must be strictly avoided. Guidelines as stipulated in the environmental laws must be sincerely followed. Lives of all living beings are impacted either positively or negatively depending on how well their surrounding environment is maintained (naturally or artificially). Humans also are no exception to this. In other words, health of an environment influences the health of our society. Hence, environmental safety must not be an option else a top priority of every business.

          The biggest problem with CSR is not that it has limitations, nor is it concerning its questionable ability to sufficiently address the problems it intends to ameliorate. Rather, it is the fact that it takes people to a completely wrong direction. For many large corporations, CSR is primarily a strategy to divert attention away from the negative social and environmental impacts of their activities. In the Asian context, CSR mostly involves activities like adopting villages for what they call a ‘holistic development’, in which they provide medical and sanitation facilities, build school and houses, and helping villagers become self-reliant by teaching them vocational and business skills. Such corporate strategies have been effectively hegemonic, providing a strong legitimacy and license for corporations to sustain the exploitation of human and natural resources. More importantly, it leads people to wrongly assume that the business houses, and not the states, are responsible for citizens’ basic rights to better education, clean water, healthcare, etc. It disciplines the uninformed poor motivating them to behave in ways that make state regulation obsolete, while leaving them at the mercy of market forces.

           Question 3. Business ethics and social responsibility are not synonyms but are closely related. Substantiate.

          <strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
           Answer:
          </strong>
          Business ethics and social responsibility are the words that are almost used as a common parlance interchangeably. While social responsibility is self explanatory, ethics is a word that puts one in a dilemma. Social responsibility looks clearly defined and demarcated. Companies have a policy of social responsibility known as Corporate Social Responsibility whereby they commit to follow their businesses in such a way so as to benefit the community at large. But ethics is a loose term that is dependent upon a person’s conscience. There are certain differences between the two and the two are not overlapping completely.
          <br/>
          <strong>
           Business Ethics
          </strong>
          <br/>
          To understand business ethics, first we need to understand and spell out clearly the word ‘ethics’. Derived from ancient Greek word ethos, ethics has come to mean moral character. Ethical behaviour is what is good or right. Ethical senses always make use of good, bad, right and wrong. Applying this definition to business, we come to a conclusion that though the primary objective of any business or company is to maximize by the decisions taken by the company for the operation of business.
          <br/>
          Business ethics is the behaviour of any business that it indulges in its dealings with the community or society. For some, making money is all they are interested in, and this is capitalism in its dirtiest form. These people are least concerned with the bad effects of their business practices and the harm they are doing to the society at large. When companies do not engage in good business ethics, they are penalised by the law. But such cases are rare and the profits of companies engaging in unethical behaviour are far more than these punitive fines.
          <br/>
          <strong>
           Social Responsibility
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Man is a social animal and cannot live in isolation. He is expected to behave in a manner that is socially and morally acceptable to others. The same applies to businesses. Though the primary objective of any business is to earn maximum profits for the owners and shareholders, it is also expected to conduct its operations in a manner that it fulfills its social obligations also. For example, though it is not binding on any private sector company to provide employment to the disabled or weaker sections of the society, it is considered to be a part of the social responsibility of the company to absorb people from such sections of the society. Similarly though there is not written law to compel a company to engage in acts to do something to reduce pollution or to do something for the betterment of environment, taking up projects to clean up environment are considered to be a part of the social responsibility of the company. Difference between Business Ethics and Social Responsibility Though business ethics and social responsibility seem to be overlapping, there has always been a contradiction between the two.
         </p>
         <ol>
          <li>
           Companies, though they are committed to be socially responsible for their behaviour have been found to be engaging in acts that cannot be called ethical.
          </li>
          <li>
           What is good for the society is sometimes not good for the business, and what is good for the business is almost always not good for the society.
          </li>
          <li>
           If the society is conscious, it responds in such a way that businesses are forced to behave responsibly. The same applies to the administration and the judiciary of any country.
          </li>
          <li>
           For example, selling of liquor and tobacco in any society is not against business ethics though it may be against the principles of social responsibility. The same applies to lotteries and gambling. But it is certainly against business ethics as well as against social responsibility to entice minors to engage in smoking and drinking.

           Answer:
          </strong>
          Social Return on Investment (SROI) is a principle based method for measuring extra-financial value (i.e., environmental and social value not currently reflected in conventional financial accounts) relative to resources invested. It can be used by any entity to evaluate impact on stakeholders, identify ways to improve performance, and enhance the performance of investments.
          <br/>
          A network was formed in 2006 to facilitate the continued evolution of the method. Over 570 practitioners globally are members of the SROI Network.
          <br/>
          The SROI method as it has been standardized by the SROI Network provides a consistent quantitative approach to understanding and managing the impact of a project, business, organisation, fund or policy. It accounts for stake holders views of impact, and puts financial ‘proxy’ values on all those impacts identified by stakeholders which do not typically have market values. The aim is to include the values of people that are often excluded from markets in the same terms as used in markets, that is money, in order to give people a voice in resource allocation decisions.
          <br/>
          Some SROI users employ a version of the method that does not require that all impacts be assigned a financial proxy. Instead the “numerator” includes monetized, quantitative but not monetized, qualitative, and narrative types of information about value. Benefits that cannot be Monetized: There will be some benefits that are important to stakeholders but which cannot be monetized. An SROI analysis should not be restricted to one number, but seen as a framework for exploring an organization’s social impact, in which monetization plays an important but not an exclusive role. Focus on Monetization: One of the dangers of SROI is that people may focus on monetization without following the rest of the process, which is crucial to proving and improving. Moreover, an organisation must be clear about its mission and values and understand how its activities change the world – not only what it does but also what difference it makes. This clarity informs stakeholder engagement. Therefore, if an organisation seeks to monetize its impact without having considered its mission and stakeholders, then it risks choosing inappropriate indicators; and as a result the SROI calculations can be of limited use or even misconstrued.
          <br/>
          <strong>
           Needs considerable Capacity:
          </strong>
          SROI is time and resource, intensive. It is most easily used when an organisation is already measuring the direct and longer term results of its work with people, groups, or the environment.
          <br/>
          <strong>
           Some outcomes not easily associated with monetary value:
          </strong>
          Some outcomes and impacts (for example, increased self-esteem, improved family relationships) cannot be
          <br/>
          easily associated with a monetary value. In order to incorporate these benefits into the SROI ratio proxies for these values would be required. SROI analysis is a developing area and as SROI evolves it is possible that methods of monetizing more outcomes will become available and that there will be increasing number of people using the same proxies.
