          Question 1.
          <br/>
          How did Britain’s involvement in wars from 1793 to 1815 affect British industries?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Both Britain and France were at war between 1793 to 1815. The industries of Britain were badly affected with this war. That is why Britain was unable to get capital formation and reinvestment during war period. It had to use borrowed capital to fight rather than reinvestment. Due to war, factories were shut down. Trade declined. The prices of essential commodities were very high. So, this war affected British industries in many ways.

          Question 2.
          <br/>
          What were the relative advantages of canal and railway transportation?

          Answer:
          <br/>
          Advantages of Canal Transportation: It was the cheapest mode of transportation. It was made easier to transport heavier goods from mines to factories. When big cities and towns were linked to these canals, the city people were able to get various essential commodities such as coal and tool items at cheaper rate.
          <br/>
          Advantages of Rail Transportation: The use of railways helped in increasing the production of coal and iron industry. It also did a lot of help. Railways helped in carrying heavy goods through various regions of the country.

          Question 4.
          <br/>
          Indicate how the supply of raw materials affected the nature of British industrialization.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Since 17th century, Britain had been importing bales of cotton cloth from India at exorbitant price. But after the entry of East India Company into India, it began to import along with cloth, raw cotton, which could be spun and woven into cloth in England. Till the early 18th century, the process of spinning had been very slow. The spinners were occupied throughout the day, while weavers waited idly to receive yarn. A lot of technological inventions closed the gap between the speed in spinning raw cotton into yarn, and weaving the yarn into fabric. The production shifted from the homes of spinners and weavers to factories.

          <br/>
          Industrialization has affected farming, transportation, communication and trade in the following ways:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Farming: Due to industrialization, farming was highly affected. The demand for raw materials grew along with the industrialization. This demand enforced the farmers to adopt new methods to have more production. The new machines were invented for digging the soil, sowing and reaping. A number of farmers also became unemployed due to industrialization.
          </li>
          <li>
           Transport: The pucca or metalled roads were built for safe and fast transportation of goods. Navigational canals were dug up to carry the goods and passengers. The steam engines were used to run railway trains. The rapid development of the means of transport made quite easy the transportation of finished goods and raw- materials from one country to another.
          </li>
          <li>
           Communication: The invention of telegraphy and telephone brought revolution in the field of communication as sending and receiving of messages became easier. It was much helpful in the growth of industry.
          </li>
          <li>
           Effects on Trade: The production of goods encouraged the trade. The international trade grew very fast as it was easy for any industrialized country to import raw material and export the finished goods to any part of the world.

         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Luddism, was a movement led by the charismatic General Ned Ludd. Its main aim was to demand minimum wages, control over the labour of women and children, work for those who had lost their jobs because of the coming of machinery, and the right to form trade unions so that they could legally present their demands. During the early years of industrialisation, the working population did not have the right to vote nor legal methods to express their anger at the manner in which their lives had been overturned. About 80,000 people gathered peacefully in August 1819, at St.Peter’s Fields in Manchester to claim democratic rights of political organization, public meetings and of the freedom of the press.
          </li>
          <li>
           This movement was ruthlessly suppressed. It was known as Peterloo Massacre Their demands were rejected by the Parliament.

          Question 1.
          <br/>
          What were relative advantages of canal and railway transportation?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Advantages of Canal Transportation
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Canals were mainly built to transport coal to cities. The bulk and weight of coal made its transport by road much slower and expensive than by barges on canals. Coal was mainly used for heating and lighting homes in cities. The demand for coal grew constantly. The first English canal was made by James Bindley in 1761. It was known as Worsely canal. Its main purpose was to carry coal from the coal deposits at Worsely (near Manchester) to that city; after the canal was completed.
          </li>
          <li>
           Canals were usually built by big landowners. The confluence of canals created marketing centres in new towns. For example, the city of Birmingham owed its growth to its position at the heart of a canal system connecting London, the Bristol Channel, and the Mersey and Humber rivers. Between 1760 to 1790, 25 projects of canal building began. The period between 1788 to 1796 is known as canal mania. In it, there were another 46 new projects and over the next 60 years more than 4,000 miles of canal were built.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          Advantages of Railway Transportation
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Railways emerged as a new means of transportation available throughout the year. It was both cheap and fast, to carry passengers and goods.
          </li>
          <li>
           In the second stage, the invention of the railways took the entire process of industrialisation. In 1801, Richard Trevithick had devised an engine called the ‘Puffing Devil’. In 1814, the railway engineer George Stephenson invented a lomocotive called ‘The Blutcher’. It could pull a weight of 30 tonnes upto a hill at 4 mph. The first railway line connected the cities of Stockton and Darlington in 1825. The distance between the two cities was just nine miles which could be covered in 2 hours at the speed of 24 KPh.

          Question 4.
          <br/>
          How did the Industrial Revolution in England affect India’s economy?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Industrial Revolution in England became the main cause of poverty in India. As India was a colony of England, it hit the Indian economy adversely. Due to the Industrial Revolution in England India’s economy was affected in the following ways:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           The Industrial Revolution enabled England to produce more goods than needed there. Indian markets were flooded with the machine made goods from England. In this way, India became a big consumer of the English goods.
          </li>
          <li>
           The Industrial Revolution in England threw the Indian artisans and handicrafts men out of job. As a result, small industries of India collapsed.
          </li>
          <li>
           The British Government forced the Indian farmers to sell their raw materials at cheap rates to the British factory owners. The policy of exploiting the Indian economy for the benefit of the British capitalist was the direct consequence of the Industrial Revolution on India’s economy.
          </li>
          <li>
           The unemployed artisans again became the farm labourers. They became a burden on the Indian agriculture. In this way, within very short-time, India became a poor country where agriculture was the only occupation of the people.
          </li>
          <li>
           Before the Industrial Revolution, India was the major producer of cotton, woollen and silken clothes. Now India suffered a severe setback in these industries. Clothes made by the British mills were cheaper than the Indian clothes.
          </li>
          <li>
           The Indian goods could not compete with the British goods. The British Government in India imposed heavy duties on the Indian goods and discouraged the Indian craftsmen ir. many ways so that they could never think of competing with the British goods.

          <br/>
          What sort of reforms through laws were made by the British government to improve the condition of workers? What were the weaknesses of these measures?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The reforms through laws made by the British government were as follows:

          <li>
           Act of 1833: Under the Act of 1833, chi’dren under the age of nine were permitted to be employed only in silk factories. This act also limited the hours of work for older children. A number of Factory Inspectors Act were also employed to ensure that the Act was enforced.
          </li>
          <li>
           Ten Hours Bill: In 1847, the Ten Hours Bill was passed. This bill limited the hours of work for women and children and secured a ten-hour day for male workers.
          </li>
          <li>
           The Mines Commission of 1842: The Mines Commission was set up in 1842. This commission revealed that working conditions in mines had become worst, because more children had been put to work in coal mines.
          </li>
          <li>
           The Mines and Collieries Act of 1842: The Mines and Collieries Act of 1842 banned children under ten and women from working in underground mines.

          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          The weaknesses of the these measures were as follows:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           It was the duty of factory inspectors to enforce the factory laws. But the inspectors were poorly paid and easily bribed by factory managers.
          </li>
          <li>
           Parents lied about the real ages of their children, so that they could work and contribute to family incomes.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Industrialisation definitely makes its impact on farming, transportation, communication and trade in the following ways:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Effects on Farming: After the Industrial Revolution, farming was highly affected. The inventions of new machines for agriculture were made. Now the machinery took the place of mankind. The farmers could sow, reap and harvest their products through machines. On the one side, production doubled but on the other side, the unemployment problem increased.
          </li>
          <li>
           Effects on Transport: Roads were built for safe and fast transportation of goods. After industrialization, production of goods increased. So the businessmen had to send their goods to the different markets. Navigational canals were dug up to carry the goods and passengers. The rapid development of the means of transport made quite easy the transportation of finished goods. Now it became easier to send goods from one country to another.
          </li>
          <li>
           Effects on the Means of Communication: After Industrial Revolution, there occurred a change in the field of communication. Telegraphy and telephone were invented. Now it became easier to receive and send the message. Now people could establish contact with others in very short time.
          </li>
          <li>
           Effects on Trade: Trade was highly affected. As the products increased, it also encouraged trade. The international trade grew fast. It became easier for any industrialized country to import raw material and to export the finished goods to any part of the world market.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          Question 7.
          <br/>
          Do you think the period between 1780 to 1820 is considered to be revolutionary for the growth of cotton or iron industries?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          For textile industries, the raw materials like cotton was not grown in Britain. So, Britain imported it from other countries to produce their products. After the Industrial Revolution, a number of inventions were made. Machines of high quality and capacity were made. The production also increased. To sell their products, the manufacturers sent them to other countries. Most of the products were sold in Indian markets. Since 1780, the imports and exports of British goods also increased. After the War of American Independence, its trade with North America was interrupted. But after 1780, its trading relations with North America also established again.
         </p>
         <p>
          After 1815-20, economic changes also occurred. After French Revolution, industrialization was highly affected. Industrialization is mainly related with growth in investment in capital formation. After 1820, these things gradually appeared. Now technical progress was not only confined to these areas but also other areas too. Now its progress could be seen in other branches too. So, growth in the cotton or iron industries from 1780 to 1820 is not called revolutionary.

         <p>
          Question 8.
          <br/>
          What were the most favorable conditions for industrialization?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The most favorable conditions for industrialization were as follows:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Natural resources: For the development of any industry, the availability of natural resources is must. It must be in abundance.
          </li>
          <li>
           Capital: Sufficient capital is also necessary for the development of industries. Without the availability of capital, the development of industries is not possible.
          </li>
          <li>
           Raw materials: Availability of raw-materials is also needed for the industrialisation. It must be in plenty. The raw materials include cotton, jute, sugarcane, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
           Sources of energy: There must be sufficient sources of energy like electricity, oil or coal etc.
          </li>
          <li>
           Markets: There must be potential markets for the consumers. If there is potential market, more finished goods will be consumed. And the economy will grow.
          </li>
          <li>
           Transportation facilities: There must be efficient transportation facility. Roads, railway lines, shipping facilities etc. play a major role in the development of country.
          </li>
          <li>
           Cheap labour: For the growth of any industry a number of labourers must be available at reasonable price.
          </li>
          <li>
           Suitable climate: For the growth of any industry, suitable climate is must. If the climate is not suitable, production will also be affected. Worker’s health will also deteriorate. If their health is ill, there will be shortfall in production.
          </li>
          <li>
           Govt’s policy: The policy of govt, is also one of the factors in the growth of industry. If the govt is stable, it will have positive results on the industry. The industry will grow at fast pace.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          Question 9.

          </li>
          <li>
           In Britain, goods were manufactured on large scale due to the inventions of new machine. It was also cheaper than the goods produced manually in other parts of the world. Now British goods were sold in abundance.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          Question 10.
          <br/>
          The invention of steam power proved helpful in the industrialization of Britain. How?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Steam generates tremendous power. Power is essential for the growth of any industry. Water has been the major source of energy since a long time. It was just used as hydraulic power. But it had been limited only to certain areas, seasons and by the speed of flow of the water. Now it was used as steam. Pressure was provided by steam power at high temperatures.
         </p>
         <p>
          Mining industries and Steam Power. Firstly, steam power was used in mining industries. There was a very serious problem in mining and that was flooding. The increase of demand for coal and metals increased. Efforts were also made to obtain them from deeper mines.
         </p>
         <p>
          Thomas Savery built a model of steam engine in 1698 to drain mines. Its name was Miner’s Friend. It worked in shallow depth and under intense pressure.
         </p>
         <p>
          Another steam engine was built by Thomas New comen in 1712. It had the major effect of losing energy due to the continuous cooling of the condensing cylinder.
         </p>
         <p>
          Steam Power used in Factories. The steam engine had been used only in coal mines till 1769. James Watt developed his machine in 1769. He converted the steam engine from being a mere pump into a prime mover. This machine supplied energy to power machines in factories. Watt created the Soho Foundry in Birmingham in 1775 with the help of Matthew Boulton. In this foundry Watt’s steam engines were produced in great numbers. Steam engine technology was further developed after 1800 C.E. Following factors contributed to its development:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           The use of lighter and stronger metals.
          </li>
          <li>
           The manufacture of more accurate machine tools.
          </li>
          <li>
           The spread of better scientific knowledge.
          </li>
          <li>
           Steam engine technology was further developed with the use of higher, stronger metals.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          Question 11.
          <br/>
          What are Trade unions? Discuss its aim while they were formed.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Trade union is an organisation of workers who have banded together to achieve common goals in key areas, such as working conditions. Trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members and negotiates labour contracts with employers. This may include the negotiation of wages, work rules, complaint procedures, rules governing hiring, promotion of workers, benefits, workplace safety and policies. The agreements negotiated by the union leaders are binding on the rank and file members and the employer and in some cases on other non-member workers. Trade unions became popular in many countries during the Industrial Revolution. Aims of the formation of Trade unions

         <p>
          In his novel Hard Times, Charles Dickens (1812-70), perhaps the most severe contemporary critic of the horrors of industrialization for the poor, wrote a fictional account of an industrial town he aptly called Coketown. ‘It was a town of red brick, or of brick that would have been red if the smoke and ashes had allowed it; but as matters stood it was a town of unnatural red and black like the painted face of a savage. It was a town of machinery and tall chimneys, out of which interminable serpents of smoke trailed themselves for ever and ever, and never got uncoiled. It had a black canal in it, and a river that ran purple with ill-smelling dye, and vast piles of building full of windows where there was a rattling and a trembling all day long, and where the piston of the steam-engine worked monotonously up and down, like the head of an elephant in a stare of melancholy madness.
