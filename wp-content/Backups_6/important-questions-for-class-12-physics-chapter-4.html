          Question 1.
          <br/>
          What is the direction of the force acting on a charged particle q, moving with a velocity \(\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}\) in a uniform magnetic field B? (Delhi)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The direction of the force acting on a charged particle q, moving with a velocity \(\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}\) in a uniform
          <br/>
          magnetic field \(\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}\) is perpendicular to the plane of vectors \(\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}\) and \(\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}\)
          <br/>
          <img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 4 Moving Charges and Magnetism Class 12 Important Questions 1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117129" height="41" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 376px) 100vw, 376px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-4-Moving-Charges-and-Magnetism-Class-12-Important-Questions-1.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-4-Moving-Charges-and-Magnetism-Class-12-Important-Questions-1.png 376w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-4-Moving-Charges-and-Magnetism-Class-12-Important-Questions-1-300x33.png 300w" width="376"/>
          <br/>
          So, force is perpendicular to both \(\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}\) and \(\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}\). From equation (i), we can also say that the force \(\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}\) acts in the direction of the vectors \(\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}\) and \(\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}\)

          Question 2.
          <br/>
          Why should the spring/suspension wire in a moving coil galvanometer have low torsional constant? (All India 2008)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Low torsional constant is basically required to increase the current/charge sensitivity in a moving coil ballistic galvanometer.
         </p>
         <p>
          Question 3.
          <br/>
          Magnetic field lines can be entirely confined within the core of a toroid, but not within a straight solenoid. Why? (Delhi 2008)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          At the edges of the solenoid, the field lines get diverged due to other fields and/or non-availability of dipole loops, while in toroids the dipoles (in loops) orient continuously.

          Question 4.
          <br/>
          An electron does not suffer any deflection while passing through a region of uniform magnetic field. What is the direction of the magnetic field? (All India 2009)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          <img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 4 Moving Charges and Magnetism Class 12 Important Questions 2" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117130" height="32" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-4-Moving-Charges-and-Magnetism-Class-12-Important-Questions-2.png" width="263"/>
          <br/>
          ∴Magnetic field will be in the line of the velocity of electron.

          Question 5.
          <br/>
          A beam of a particles projected along +x-axis, experiences a force due to a magnetic field along the +y-axis. What is the direction of the magnetic field? (All India 2009)

          Question 14.
          <br/>
          Why do the electrostatic field lines not form closed loops? (All India 2015)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Electric field lines do not form closed loops because the direction of an electric field is from positive to negative charge. So one can regard a line of force starting from a positive charge and ending on a negative charge. This indicates that electric field lines do not form closed loops.

          Question 22.
          <br/>
          Write the expression for Lorentz magnetic force on a particle of charge ‘q’ moving with velocity \(\vec{v}\) in a magnetic field \(\vec{B}\). Show that no work is done by this force on the charged particle. (All India 2011)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Expression for Lorentz magnetic force on a particle of charge ‘q’ moving with velocity \(\vec{v}\) in a magnetic field \(\vec{B}\) is \(\vec{F}\) = q(\(\vec{E}\) + \(\vec{v}\) × \(\vec{B}\))
          <br/>
          Work done by a magnetic force on a charged particle :
          <br/>
          The magnetic force \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{F}}=q(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{E}}+\vec{v} \times \overrightarrow{\mathrm{B}})\) always acts perpendicular to the velocity \(\vec{v}\) on the direction of motion of charge q.

Thus if the frequency of the applied voltage is kept exactly the same as the frequency of the revolution of the proton, then everytime the proton reaches the gap between the two dees, the electric field is reversed and proton receives a push and finally it acquires very high energy. This proton follows a spiral path. The accelerated proton is ejected through a window by a deflecting voltage and hits the target.

          Find the condition under which the charged particles moving with different speeds in the presence of electric and magnetic field vectors can be used to select charged particles of a particular speed. (All India 2015)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Condition: The velocity \(\vec{v}\) of the charged particles, and the \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{E}}\) and \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{B}}\) vectors, should be mutually perpendicular
         </p>
         <p>
          It means that the forces on q, due to \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{E}}\) and \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{B}}\) must be oppositely directed.

          describing a larger semicircle than before. Thus if the frequency of the applied voltage is kept exactly the same as the frequency of the revolution of the proton, then everytime the proton reaches the gap between the two dees, the electric field is reversed and proton receives a push and finally it acquires very high energy. This proton follows a spiral path. The accelerated proton is ejected through a window by a deflecting voltage and hits the target.

          Question 52.
          <br/>
          State the underlying principle of working of a moving coil galvanometer. Write two reasons why a galvanometer can not be used as such to measure current in a given circuit. Name any two factors on which the current sensitivity of a galvanometer depends. (Delhi 2010)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) Moving coil galvanometer works on the principle of a torque experienced by a current carrying coil placed in a magnetic field, whose magnitude is a function of current passing through the coil.
          <br/>
          (ii) The galvanometer cannot be used to measure the value of the current in a given circuit due to the following two reasons:
          <br/>
          (a) Galvanometer is a very sensitive device. It gives a full scale deflection for a small value of current.
          <br/>
          (b) The galvanometer has to be connected in series for measuring currents and as it has a large resistance, this will change the value of the current in the circuit.
          <br/>
          (iii)
          <br/>

          Question 65.
          <br/>
          Consider the motion of a charged particle of mass ‘m’ and charge ‘q’ moving with velocity \(\vec{v}\) in a magnetic field \(\vec{B}\).
          <br/>
          (a) If \(\vec{v}\) is perpendicular to \(\vec{B}\), show that it describes a circular path having angular frequency ω = qB/m.
          <br/>
          (b) If the velocity \(\vec{v}\) has a component parallel to the magnetic field \(\vec{B}\), trace the path described by the particle. Justify your answer. (Comptt. Delhi 2014)

          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) When a charged particle with charge q moves inside a magnetic field \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{B}}\) with velocity v, it experiences a force, which is given by

          (a)
          <br/>
          Principle : “If a current carrying coil is freely suspended/pivoted in a uniform magnetic field, it experiences a deflecting torque.”

          Question 67.
          <br/>
          A uniform magnetic field \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{B}}\) is set up along the positive x-axis. A particle of charge ‘q’ and mass ‘m’ moving with a velocity v enters the field at the origin in X-Y plane such that it has velocity components both along and perpendicular to the magnetic field \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{B}}\). Trace, giving reason, the trajectory followed by the particle. Find out the expression for the distance moved by the particle along the magnetic field in one rotation. (All India 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Since the velocity of the particle is inclined to x-axis, thererfore, the velocity has a component along B, this component remains unchanged as the motion along the magnetic field will not be affected by the magnetic field. The motion in a plane perpendicular to B is as before a circular one, thereby producing a helical motion, which is its trajectory.
         </p>
         <p>
          If r is the radius of the circular path of a particle, then a force of mv

          /r, acts perpendicular to the path towards the centre of the circle and is called the centripetal force. If the velocity v is perpendicular to the magnetic field B, the magnetic force is perpendicular to both v and B and acts like a centripetal force. It has a magnitude qvB.

          <br/>
          (a) Why is the magnetic field radial in a moving coil galvanometer? Explain how it is achieved.
          <br/>
          (b) A galvanometer of resistance ‘G’ can be converted into a voltmeter of range (0 – V) volts by connecting a resistance ‘R’ in series with it. How much resistance will be required to change its range from 0 to V/2? (Comptt. All India 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) The magnetic field in a moving coil galvanometer is made ‘radial’ to keep the magnetic field ‘normal’ to the area vector of the coil. It is done by taking the cylindrical soft iron core. The torque acting on the coil is maximum (sin θ = 1, when, θ = 90°)
          <br/>
          (b) Given : resistance of galvanomter = G Ω
          <br/>
          Range of voltmeter (R

          Working. When current is passed, say along ABCD, the couple acts on it. Since the plane remains always parallel to the magnetic field in all positions of the coil (radial field), the force on the vertical arms always remains perpendicular to the place of the coil.
         </p>
         <p>
          Let, I be the current flowing through coil,
          <br/>
          B be magnetic field supposed to be uniform and always parallel to the coil, A be area of the coil
          <br/>
          Deflecting torque acting on the coil is,
          <br/>
          τ = nI BA sin 900
         </p>
         <p>
          Due to deflecting torque, the coil rotates and suspension wire gets twisted. A restoring torque is set up in the suspension fibre. If &lt;|) is angle through which the coil rotates and k is the restoring torque per unit angular twist, then restoring torque, τ = kϕ
          <br/>
          In equilibrium,
          <br/>
          Deflecting torque = Restoring torque

          (c) One uses a shunt resistance in parallel with the galvanometer, so that most of the current passes through the shunt. In the case of a voltmeter, a resistance of large value is used in series because it must draw a very small current, otherwise the voltage measurement will disturb the original set up by an amount which is very large.

          Write the expression for the magnetic force \(\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}\) acting on a charged particle q moving with velocity \(\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}\) in the presence of the magnetic field \(\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}\) in a vector form. Show that no work is done and no change in the magnitude of the velocity of the particle is produced by this force. Hence define the unit of magnetic field. (Comptt. All India 2016)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) The required expression is \([latex]\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}=q(\vec{v} \times \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}})\)
          <br/>
          (ii) The magnetic force, at all instants, is, therefore, perpendicular to the instantaneous direction of \(\vec{v}\), which is also the instantaneous direction of displacement (\(\overrightarrow{d s}\)).
          <br/>
          Since, \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{F}}\) is perpendicular to (\(\overrightarrow{d s}\)), at all instants, work done \((=\overrightarrow{\mathrm{F}} \cdot \overrightarrow{d s})\) is zero

          <br/>
          (i) When velocity of charged particle and magnetic field are perpendicular to each other, it will move in a circular path.
          <br/>
          (ii) When velocity is neither parallel nor perpendicular to the magnetic field, it will move in helical path.
          <br/>
          (b) The force experienced by the charged particle, is perpendicular to the instantaneous velocity \(\vec{v}\), at all instants.
          <br/>
          Hence the magnetic force cannot bring any change in the speed of the charged particle. Since speed remains constant, the kinetic energy also stays constant.

          <br/>
          (ii) directly proportional to the length dl of the element \(d \vec{B}\) ∝ dl.
          <br/>
          (iii) directly proportional to sin θ, where θ is the angle between d\(\overrightarrow{l}\) and \(\overrightarrow{r}\),
          <br/>

          Question 94.
          <br/>
          (a) With the help of a diagram, explain the principle and working of a moving coil galvanometer.
          <br/>
          (b) What is the importance of a radial magnetic field and how is it produced?
          <br/>
          (c) Why is it that while using a moving coil galvanometer as a voltmeter a high resistance in series is required whereas in an ammeter a shunt is used? (All India)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Principle : “If a current carrying coil is freely suspended/pivoted in a uniform magnetic field, it experiences a deflecting torque.”
          <br/>
          Working: As the pivoted coil is placed in a radial magnetic field, hence on passing current I through it, a deflecting torque acts on the coil which is given by, τ = NAIB
          <br/>
          <img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 4 Moving Charges and Magnetism Class 12 Important Questions 204" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117333" height="42" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-4-Moving-Charges-and-Magnetism-Class-12-Important-Questions-204.png" width="300"/>
          <br/>
          The spring S
          <sub>
           p
          </sub>
          attached to the coil provides the counter torque and in equilibrium state balances the deflecting torque. If φ is steady angular deflection then counter torque is kφ.
          <br/>
          …where [k = torsional constant of the spring
          <br/>
          <img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 4 Moving Charges and Magnetism Class 12 Important Questions 205" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117334" height="249" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-4-Moving-Charges-and-Magnetism-Class-12-Important-Questions-205.png" width="273"/>
          <br/>
          In equilibrium state,
          <br/>
          <img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 4 Moving Charges and Magnetism Class 12 Important Questions 206" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117335" height="43" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-4-Moving-Charges-and-Magnetism-Class-12-Important-Questions-206.png" width="295"/>
          <br/>
          Thus, deflection is directly proportional to the current flowing in the coil.
          <br/>
          (a) (i) Uniform radial magnetic field. It keeps the magnetic field line normal to the area vector of the coil.
          <br/>
          (ii) Soft iron core in galvanometer. The cylindrical soft iron core, when placed inside the coil of a galvanometer, makes the magnetic field stronger and radial in the space between it and pole pieces, such that whatever the position of the rotation of the coil may be, the magnetic field is always parallel to its plane.
         </p>
         <p>
          (b) (i) Current sensitivity is defined as the deflection produced in the galvanometer when unit current is passed through its coil.

          <br/>
          does not necessarily increase the voltage sensitivity. It may be affected by the resistance used.
         </p>
         <p>
          (b) For radial magnetic field, sin θ = 1,
          <br/>
          so torque τ = NIAB.
          <br/>
          Thus when radial magnetic field is used, the deflection of the coil is proportional to the current flowing through it. Hence a linear scale can be used to determine the deflection of the coil.
         </p>
         <p>
          (c) A high resistance is joined in series with a galvanometer so that when the arrangement (voltmeter) is used in parallel with the selected section of the circuit, it should draw least amount of current. In case voltmeter draws appreciable amount of current, it will disturb the original value of potential difference by a good amount.
         </p>
         <p>
          To convert a galvanometer into ammeter, a shunt is used in parallel with it so that when the arrangement is joined in series, the maximum current flows through the shunt, and thus the galvanometer is saved from its damage, when the current is passed through ammeter.

          Question 96.
          <br/>
          State Biot-Savart law, giving the mathematical expression for it.
          <br/>
          Use this law to derive the expression for the magnetic field due to a circular coil carrying current at a point along its axis.
          <br/>
          How does a circular loop carrying current behave as a magnet? (Delhi 2011)

          Answer:
          <br/>
          According to Biot-Savart’s law, “magnetic field acting at a particular point due to current carrying element is proportional to the division of cross product of current element and position vector of point where the field is to be calculated from the current element to the cube of the distance between current element and the point where the field is to be calculated”.

          describing a larger semicircle than before. Thus if the frequency of the applied voltage is kept exactly the same as the frequency of the revolution of the proton, then everytime the proton reaches the gap between the two dees, the electric field is reversed and proton receives a push and finally it acquires very high energy. This proton follows a spiral path. The accelerated proton is ejected through a window by a deflecting voltage and hits the target.

          Yes, there is an upper limit. The increase in the kinetic energy of particles is qv. Therefore, the radius of their path goes on increasing each time, their kinetic energy increases. The lines are repeatedly accelerated across the dees, untill they have the required energy to have a radius approximately that of the dees. Hence, this is the upper limit on the energy required by the particles due to definite size of dees.

          <br/>
          The perpendicular components of the magnetic field due to these elements being equal and opposite cancel each other. Hence the total contribution of perpendicular components, (i.e. dB cos θ) to the net magnetic field is zero.
         </p>
         <p>
          On the other hand, dB sin θ component of magnetic field due to each element of the coil or loop is directed in the same direction.
         </p>
         <p>
          Therefore, magnetic field at point P due to the whole coil or loop is equal to the sum of dB sin θ components of magnetic field due to each element

Thus if the frequency of the applied voltage is kept exactly the same as the frequency of the revolution of the proton, then everytime the proton reaches the gap between the two dees, the electric field is reversed and proton receives a push and finally it acquires very high energy. This proton follows a spiral path. The accelerated proton is ejected through a window by a deflecting voltage and hits the target.

          Question 111.
          <br/>
          Explain, using a labelled diagram, the principle and working of a moving coil galvanometer.
          <br/>
          (a) What is the function of
          <br/>
          (i) uniform radial magnetic field,
          <br/>
          (ii) soft iron core?
          <br/>
          (b)Define the terms
          <br/>
          (i) current sensitivity and
          <br/>
          (ii) voltage sensitivity of a galvanometer. Why does increasing the current sensitivity not necessarily increase voltage sensitivity? (All India 2011)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Principle : “If a current carrying coil is freely suspended/pivoted in a uniform magnetic field, it experiences a deflecting torque.”
          <br/>
          Working: As the pivoted coil is placed in a radial magnetic field, hence on passing current I through it, a deflecting torque acts on the coil which is given by, τ = NAIB
          <br/>
          <img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 4 Moving Charges and Magnetism Class 12 Important Questions 204" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117333" height="42" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-4-Moving-Charges-and-Magnetism-Class-12-Important-Questions-204.png" width="300"/>
          <br/>
          The spring S
          <sub>
           p
          </sub>
          attached to the coil provides the counter torque and in equilibrium state balances the deflecting torque. If φ is steady angular deflection then counter torque is kφ.
          <br/>
          …where [k = torsional constant of the spring

          <img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 4 Moving Charges and Magnetism Class 12 Important Questions 206" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117335" height="43" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-4-Moving-Charges-and-Magnetism-Class-12-Important-Questions-206.png" width="295"/>
          <br/>
          Thus, deflection is directly proportional to the current flowing in the coil.
          <br/>
          (a) (i) Uniform radial magnetic field. It keeps the magnetic field line normal to the area vector of the coil.
          <br/>
          (ii) Soft iron core in galvanometer. The cylindrical soft iron core, when placed inside the coil of a galvanometer, makes the magnetic field stronger and radial in the space between it and pole pieces, such that whatever the position of the rotation of the coil may be, the magnetic field is always parallel to its plane.
          <br/>
          (b) (i) Current sensitivity is defined as the deflection produced in the galvanometer when unit current is passed through its coil.

          (b) Moving coil galvanometer. It is a device used for the detection and measurement of small electric current.
          <br/>
          Principle. The working is based on the fact that a current carrying coil suspended in a magnetic field experiences a torque.
          <br/>
          Construction. It consists of a coil having a large number of turns of insulated copper wire wound on a metallic frame. The coil is suspended by means of a phosphor-bronze strip and is surrounded by a horse-shoe magnet NS. A hair spring is attached to lower end of the coil. The other end of the spring is attached to the scale through a pointer.

          Working. When current is passed, say along ABCD, the couple acts on it. Since the plane remains always parallel to the magnetic field in all positions of the coil (radial field), the force on the vertical arms always remains perpendicular to the place of the coil.
         </p>
         <p>
          Let, I be the current flowing through coil,
          <br/>
          B be magnetic field supposed to be uniform and always parallel to the coil, A be area of the coil
          <br/>
          Deflecting torque acting on the coil is,
          <br/>
          τ = nI BA sin 900
         </p>
         <p>
          Due to deflecting torque, the coil rotates and suspension wire gets twisted. A restoring torque is set up in the suspension fibre. If &lt;|) is angle through which the coil rotates and k is the restoring torque per unit angular twist, then restoring torque, τ = kϕ
          <br/>
          In equilibrium,
          <br/>
          Deflecting torque = Restoring torque

          Function of Soft iron core, which not only makes the field radial but also increases the strength of the magnetic field.
          <br/>
          (c) One uses a shunt resistance in parallel with the galvanometer, so that most of the current passes through the shunt. In the case of a voltmeter, a resistance of large value is used in series because it must draw a very small current, otherwise the voltage measurement will disturb the original set up by an amount which is very large.
