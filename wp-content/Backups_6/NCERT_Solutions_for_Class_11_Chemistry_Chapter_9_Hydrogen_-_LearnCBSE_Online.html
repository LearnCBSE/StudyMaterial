     </span>
     <br/>
     Hydrogen has electronic configuration 1s
     <sup>

       Question 3.
      </strong>
     </span>
     <br/>
     Why does hydrogen occur in a diatomic form rather than in a monoatomic form under normal conditions?
     <br/>
     <span style="color: #008000;">
      <strong>
       Solution.
      </strong>
     </span>
     <br/>
     In monoatomic form hydrogen atom has only one electron in K-shell (1s
     <sup>
      1
     </sup>
     ) while in diatomic form, the K-shell is complete (1s
     <sup>
      2
     </sup>
     ). This means that in diatomic form, hydrogen (H
     <sub>
      2
     </sub>
     ) has acquired the configuration of nearest noble gas, helium. It is therefore, quite stable.

     <br/>
     How can the production of dihydrogen, obtained from ‘coal gasification’, be increased?
     <br/>
     <span style="color: #008000;">
      <strong>
       Solution.
      </strong>
     </span>
     <br/>
     The process of producing ‘syngas’ from coal is called “coal gasification”.
     <br/>
     <img alt="NCERT Solutions for Class 11 Chemistry Chapter 9 Hydrogen 2" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35262" data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" height="37" loading="lazy" src="https://www.cbsetuts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-11-Chemistry-Chapter-9-Hydrogen-2.png?resize=283%2C37&amp;ssl=1" width="283"/>
     <br/>
     The production of dihydrogen can be increased by reacting carbon monoxide of syngas mixtures with steam in the presence of iron chromate as catalyst.
     <br/>

     <span style="color: #008000;">
      <strong>
       Solution.
      </strong>

     <br/>
     Discuss the consequences of high enthalpy of H — H bond in terms of chemical reactivity of dihydrogen.
     <br/>
     <span style="color: #008000;">
      <strong>
       Solution.
      </strong>
     </span>
     <br/>
     Dihydrogen is quite stable and dissociates into hydrogen atoms only when heated at about 2000 K.
     <br/>
     <img alt="NCERT Solutions for Class 11 Chemistry Chapter 9 Hydrogen 8" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35268" data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" height="40" loading="lazy" src="https://www.cbsetuts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-11-Chemistry-Chapter-9-Hydrogen-8.png?resize=217%2C40&amp;ssl=1" width="217"/>
     <br/>
     Above 2000 K, the dissociation of hydrogen into atoms is only 0.081% which increases to 95.5% at 5000 K. Its bond dissociation energy is very high.
     <br/>
     <img alt="NCERT Solutions for Class 11 Chemistry Chapter 9 Hydrogen 9" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35269" data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" height="26" loading="lazy" src="https://www.cbsetuts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-11-Chemistry-Chapter-9-Hydrogen-9.png?resize=258%2C26&amp;ssl=1" width="258"/>
     <br/>
     Due to its high bond dissociation energy it is not very reactive.

    <ol>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Electron-deficient hydrides :
      </strong>
      The hydrides of group 13 elements have an incomplete octet and hence are electron deficient molecules. They act as Lewis acids e.g., B

       4
      </sub>
      ) which have tetrahedral structure.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Electron rich compounds of hydrogen :
      </strong>
      These compounds have excess electrons which are present as lone pairs, elements of group 15-17 form such compounds, e.g., NH

       3
      </sub>
      has one lone pair, H

     <br/>
     It is expected to be a Lewis acid. For example, diborane B

     <br/>
     Hydrides of d-block (Group No. 3, 4, 5 and 6) and f-block are metallic or interstitial hydrides because in these hydrides, hydrogen occupies some interstitial sites in the metal lattice producing distortion. These hydrides are also called non-stoichiometric hydrides as, the law of constant composition does not hold good for them, e.g., LaH

     <br/>
     When the atoms of hydrogen produced as above are made to fall at some metal surface, they combine to form molecular hydrogen again along with the liberation of large amount of heat energy. The temperature rises to 4000-5000°C. This is the principle of atomic hydrogen torch which is used for welding purposes.
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Oxy-hydrogen torch :
     </strong>
     When hydrogen is burnt in oxygen, the reaction is highly exothermic in nature. A temperature ranging between 2800°C to 4000°C is generated. This temperature can be employed for welding purpose in the form of oxy-hydrogen torch.

      <strong>
       Solution.
      </strong>
     </span>
     <br/>
     No, demineralised water is not always useful for drinking purposes. It is usually tasteless. Moreover, some ions such as Na

      <strong>
       Solution.
      </strong>
     </span>
     <br/>
     A major part of all living organisms is made up of water. It is a crucial compound for the survival of all forms of life. It is a solvent of great importance.
     <br/>
     Liquid water is found in water bodies, such as ocean, sea, lake, river, stream, canal, pond, or puddle. The majority of water on the Earth is ocean water. Water is important in both chemical and physical weathering processes at the Earth’s surface. Water exists as vapours in the atmosphere.
     <br/>
     All known forms of life depend on water. Water is vital both as a solvent in which many of the body’s solutes dissolve and as an essential part of many metabolic processes within the body.

     <span style="color: #008000;">
      <strong>
       Solution.
      </strong>
     </span>
     <br/>
     Water is useful as a solvent rather excellent solvent due to the following properties :
     <br/>
     <strong>
      (a)
     </strong>
     It is a liquid over a wide range of temperature (0° to 100°C).
     <br/>
     <strong>
      (b)
     </strong>
     It has high enthalpv of vapourisation and heat capacitv.
     <br/>
     <strong>
      (c)

     It is polar in nature and has a high dielectric constant (78.39).
     <br/>
     <strong>
      (i)
     </strong>
     It can dissolve polar substances and also some organic compounds due to hydrogen bonding.
     <br/>
     <strong>
      (ii)
     </strong>
     Water can hydrolyse oxides, halides, phosphides, nitrides, etc due to interionic attraction between them.

      <strong>
       Solution.
      </strong>
     </span>
     <br/>
     Saline hydrides such as NaH release H
     <sup>

     <br/>
     H
     <sub>
      2
     </sub>
     O
     <sub>
      2
     </sub>
     acts as bleaching agent due to the release of nascent oxygen.
