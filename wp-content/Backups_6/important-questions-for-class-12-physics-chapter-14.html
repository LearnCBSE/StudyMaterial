          Semiconductor Electronics Materials Devices and Simple Circuits Class 12 Important Questions Very Short Answer Type
         </h3>
         <p>
          Question 1.
          <br/>
          State the reason, why GaAs is most commonly used in making of a solar cell. (All India 2008)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          GaAs is most commonly used in making of a solar cell because :
          <br/>
          (i) It has high optical absorption (~ 104 cm
          <sup>
           -1
          </sup>
          ) .
          <br/>
          (ii) It has high electrical conductivity.
         </p>
         <p>
          Question 2.
          <br/>
          Why should a photodiode be operated at a reverse bias? (All India 2008)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          As fractional change in minority charge carriers is more than the fractional change in majority charge carriers, the variation in reverse saturation current is more prominent.
         </p>
         <p>
          Question 3.
          <br/>
          Give the logic symbol of NOR gate. (All India 2009)

         <p>
          Question 6.
          <br/>
          In a transistor, doping level in base is increased slightly. How will it affect
          <br/>
          (i) collector current and
          <br/>
          (ii) base current? (Delhi 2011)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Increasing base doping level will decrease base resistance and hence increasing base current, which results in a decrease in collector current.

          <br/>
          (iii) Zener diode as a voltage regulator
          <br/>
          Principle : When a zener diode is operated in the reverse breakdown region, the voltage across it remains practically constant (equal to the breakdown voltage Vz) for a large change in the reverse current. If the input voltage increases, the current through R
          <sub>
           S
          </sub>
          and zener diode also increases. This increases the voltage drop across R
          <sub>
           S
          </sub>
          without any change in the voltage across the zener diode. This is because in the breakdown region, zener voltage remains constant even though the current through the zener diode changes. Similarly, if the input voltage decreases, the voltage across R
          <sub>
           S
          </sub>
          decreases without any change in the voltage across the zener diode. Thus any increase/decrease of the input voltage results in increase/ decrease of the voltage drop across R
          <sub>
           S
          </sub>
          without any change in voltage across zener diode. Hence the zener diode acts as a voltage regulator.

          Name the semiconductor device that can be used to regulate an unregulated dc power supply. With the help of I-V characteristics of this device, explain its working principle. (Delhi 2011)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Name : Zener diode is used to regulate an unregulated dc power supply.

          <br/>
          Working principle : When a zener diode is operated in the reverse break down region, the voltage across it remains practically constant (equal to the break down voltage V-I) for a large change in the reverse current.

          Question 34.
          <br/>
          Draw the transfer characteristic curve of a base biased transistor in CE configuration. Explain clearly how the active region of the VD versus V, curve in a transistor is used as an amplifier. (Delhi 2011)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          For using the transistor as an amplifier we will use the active region of the V0 vs. V, curve. The slope of the linear part of the curve represents the rate of change of the output with input. It is negative, that is why as input voltage of the CE amplifier increases its output voltage decreases and the output is said to be out of phase with input.

          Question 36.
          <br/>
          How is forward biasing different from reverse biasing in a pn junction diode? (Delhi 2011)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Forward biasing : If the positive terminal of a battery is connected to a p-side and the negative terminal to the 72-side, then the p-n junction is said to be forward biased. Here the applied voltage V opposes the barrier voltage VB. As a result of this
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           the effective resistance across the p-n junction decreases.
          </li>
          <li>
           the diffusion of electrons and holes into the depletion layer which decreases its width.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          Reverse biasing : If the positive terminal of a battery is connected to the 72-side and negative terminal to the p-side, then the p-n junction is said to be reverse biased.
          <br/>
          The applied voltage V and the barrier potential V
          <sub>
           B
          </sub>
          are in the same direction. As a result of this
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           the resistance of the p-n junction becomes very large.
          </li>
          <li>
           the majority charge carriers move away from the junction, increasing the width of the depletion layer.
          </li>

          Question 37.
          <br/>
          Explain how a depletion region is formed in a junction diode. (Delhi 2011)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          As soon as a p-n junction is formed, the majority charge carriers begin to diffuse from the regions of higher concentration to the regions of lower concentrations. Thus the electrons from the n-region diffuse into the p-region and where they combine with the holes and get neutralised. Similarly, the holes from the p-region diffuse into the n-region where they combine with the electrons and get neutralised. This process is called electron-hole recombination.

          <br/>
          The p-region near the junction is left with immobile -ve ions and n-region near the junction is left with +ve ions as shown in the figure. The small region in the vicinity of the junction which is depleted of free charge carriers and has only immobile ions is called the depletion layer. In the depletion region, a potential difference VB is created, called potential barrier as it creates an electric field which opposes the further diffusion of electrons and holes.
          <br/>
          (i) In forward biased, the width of depletion region is decreased.
          <br/>
          (ii) In reverse biased, the width of depletion region is increased.

          Question 39.
          <br/>
          The current in the forward bias is known to be more (~mA) than the current in the reverse bias (~µA). What is the reason, then, to operate the photodiode in reverse bias? (Delhi 2012)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The fractional increase in majority carriers is much less than the fractional increase in minority carriers. Consequently, the fractional change due to the photo-effects on the minority carrier dominated reverse bias current is more easily measurable than the fractional change in the majority carrier dominated forward bias current.

          Question 40.
          <br/>
          Describe briefly with the help of a circuit diagram, how the flow of current carriers in a p-n-p transistor is regulated with emitter-base junction forward biased and base-collector junction reverse biased. (All India 2012)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          In a p-n-p transitor, the heavily doped emitter which is p-type has a majority charge carrier of holes. These holes when move towards 21-type base get neutralized by e
          <sup>
           –
          </sup>
          in base. The majority carriers enter the base region in large numbers. As the base is thin and lightly doped, the majority carriers (holes) swamp the small number of electrons there and as the collector is reverse biased, these holes can easily cross the junction and enter the collector.

          When visible light of energy greater than forbidden energy gap (i.e. hv &gt; E

           g
          </sub>
          ) is incident on a reverse biased p-n junction photodiode, additional electron-hole pairs are created in the depletion layer (or near the junction) due to the absorption of photons. The charge carriers will be separated by the junction field and made to flow across the junction, creating reverse current across the junction. The value of reverse saturation current increases with increase in the intensity of incident light. It is found that the reverse saturation current through the photodiode varies almost linearly with the light flux.
         </p>
         <p>
          When the photodiode is reverse biased then a certain current exits in the circuit even when no light is incident on the p-n junction of photodiode. This current is called dark current. A photodiode can turn its current ON and OFF in nanoseconds. Hence it can be used to detect the optical signals.

          Answer:
          <br/>
          The important considerations required while fabricating a p-n junction diode to be used as a Light Emitting Diode (LED) are :
          <br/>
          (i) The Light Emitting efficiency is maximum.

          <br/>
          The reciprocal of the slope of the linear part of the output characteristic gives the value of output resistance (r
          <sub>
           0
          </sub>
          ). The output resistance of the transistor is mainly controlled by the base-collector junction. The high magnitude of the output resistance (of the order of 100 KΩ) is due to the reverse biased state of this diode. This also explains why the resistance at the initial part of the characteristic, when the transistor is in saturation, is very low.

          Question 64.
          <br/>
          The figure given below shows the V-I characteristic of a semiconductor diode.

          <img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 14 Semiconductor Electronics Materials Devices and Simple Circuits Class 12 Important Questions 78" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-114613" height="254" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-14-Semiconductor-Electronics-Materials-Devices-and-Simple-Circuits-Class-12-Important-Questions-78.png" width="297"/>

          <br/>
          (iii) Zener diode as a voltage regulator
          <br/>
          Principle : When a zener diode is operated in the reverse breakdown region, the voltage across it remains practically constant (equal to the breakdown voltage Vz) for a large change in the reverse current. If the input voltage increases, the current through R
          <sub>
           S
          </sub>
          and zener diode also increases. This increases the voltage drop across R
          <sub>
           S
          </sub>
          without any change in the voltage across the zener diode. This is because in the breakdown region, zener voltage remains constant even though the current through the zener diode changes. Similarly, if the input voltage decreases, the voltage across R
          <sub>
           S
          </sub>
          decreases without any change in the voltage across the zener diode. Thus any increase/decrease of the input voltage results in increase/ decrease of the voltage drop across R
          <sub>
           S
          </sub>
          without any change in voltage across zener diode. Hence the zener diode acts as a voltage regulator.

          <br/>
          In the presence of an input a.c. signal, the forward biased voltage increases resulting in an increase in collector current I

          and I
          <sub>
           C
          </sub>
          both decrease during the negative half cycle as a result of reverse biasing of input section, the decrease in I

          increases the V

          during the positive and negative half input cycle results in a 180° phase difference between input and output.

          Question 66.
          <br/>
          State briefly the underlying principle of a- transistor oscillator. Draw a circuit diagram showing how the feedback is accomplished by inductive coupling. Explain the oscillator action. (All India 2008)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Principle of transistor oscillator : “Sustained a.c. signals can he obtained from an amplifier circuit without any external input signal by giving a positive feedback to the input circuit through inductive coupling or RC/LC network.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Oscillator action : In an ideal n-p-n biased transistor, when input base emitters junction and output base collector junction are forward and reverse biased respectively, a high collector current I
          <sub>
           C
          </sub>
          flows through the circuit. If in circuit switch S is on, this current I
          <sub>
           C
          </sub>
          will start flowing in the emitter circuit through the inductive coupling between coils T
          <sub>
           1
          </sub>
          and T
          <sub>
           2
          </sub>
          , which provides the +ve feedback output to input and hence make I
          <sub>
           E

          maximum. In the absence of +ve feedback the IE thus decreases making the circuit back to its original state. This process continues and ocillations are produced.

          Question 68.
          <br/>
          With the help of a suitable diagram, explain the formation of depletion region in a p-n junction. How does its width change when the junction is
          <br/>
          (i) forward biased, and
          <br/>
          (ii) reverse biased? (All India 2008)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          As soon as a p-n junction is formed, the majority charge carriers begin to diffuse from the regions of higher concentration to the regions of lower concentrations. Thus the electrons from the n-region diffuse into the p-region and where they combine with the holes and get neutralised. Similarly, the holes from the p-region diffuse into the n-region where they combine with the electrons and get neutralised. This process is called electron-hole recombination.

          <br/>
          The p-region near the junction is left with immobile -ve ions and n-region near the junction is left with +ve ions as shown in the figure. The small region in the vicinity of the junction which is depleted of free charge carriers and has only immobile ions is called the depletion layer. In the depletion region, a potential difference VB is created, called potential barrier as it creates an electric field which opposes the further diffusion of electrons and holes.
          <br/>
          (i) In forward biased, the width of depletion region is decreased.
          <br/>
          (ii) In reverse biased, the width of depletion region is increased.

          The input (base-emitter) circuit is forward biased and the output circuit (collector- emitter) is reverse biased.
          <br/>
          When no a.c. signal is applied, the potential difference V
          <sub>

          between the collector and emitter is given by

          <br/>
          When an a.c. signal is fed to the input circuit, the forward bias increases during the positive half cycle of the input. This results in increase in I
          <sub>
           C
          </sub>
          and decreases in V
          <sub>
           CC
          </sub>
          . Thus during positive half cycle of the input, the collector becomes less positive.
         </p>
         <p>
          During the negative half cycle of the input, the forward bias is decreased resulting in decrease in I
          <sub>
           E
          </sub>
          and hence I
          <sub>
           C

          . Thus V
          <sub>
           CC
          </sub>
          would increase making the collector more positive. Hence in a common-emitter amplifier, the output voltage is 180° out of phase with the input voltage.

          Question 71.
          <br/>
          Explain with the help of a circuit diagram how a zener diode works as a DC voltage regulator. Draw its I – V characteristics. (All India 2009)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Zener diode is fabricated by heavily doping both p and n-sides. Due to this, depletion region formed is very thin (&lt; 10
          <sup>
           -6
          </sup>
          n and the electric field of the junction is extremely high (~5 × 10
          <sup>
           6
          </sup>
          V / m) even for a small reverse bias voltage of 5 volts. It is seen that when the applied reverse bias voltage (V) reaches the breakdown voltage (Vz) of the Zener diode, there is a large change in the current. After the breakdown voltage Vz, a large change in the current can be produced by almost insignificant change in the reverse bias voltage. In other words, Zener voltage remains constant even though current through the Zener diode varies over a wide range. This property of the Zener diode is used for regulating voltages so that they are constant. Semiconductor diode as a half wave Rectifier : The junction diode D, supplies rectified current to the band during one half of the alternating input voltage and is always in the same direction. During the first half cycles of the alternating input voltage, junction diodes D
          <sub>
           1
          </sub>
          will conduct each permitting current to flow during one half cycle whenever its p-terminal is positive with respect to the n-terminal.

          Question 72.
          <br/>
          Draw a labelled diagram of a full wave rectifier circuit. State its working principle. Show the input-output waveforms. (All India 2009)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          p-n junction diode as full wave rectifier
          <br/>
          A full wave rectifier consists of two diodes and special type of transformer known as centre tap transformer as shown in the circuit. The secondary of transformer gives the desired a.c. voltage across A and B.
          <br/>
          During the positive half cycle of a.c. input, the diode D
          <sub>
           1

          <sub>
           2

          <br/>
          During the negative half cycle of a.c. input, the diode D
          <sub>
           1
          </sub>
          is in reverse biased and does not conduct current while diode D

          Question 76.
          <br/>
          Draw the transfer characteristic of a base-biased transistor in CE configuration. Mark the regions where the transistor can be used as a switch. Explain briefly its working. (Comptt. Delhi 2011)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Transistor as a switch. The circuit diagram of transistor as a switch is shown in Figure 1. Transfer characteristics. The graph between V
          <sub>
           0
          </sub>
          and V
          <sub>
           i
          </sub>
          is called the transfer characteristics of the base-biased transistor, shown in Figure 2.
         </p>
         <p>
          When the transistor is used in the cut off or saturation state, it acts as a switch.
         </p>
         <p>
          As long as V
          <sub>
           i
          </sub>
          is low and unable to forward bias the transistor, then V
          <sub>
           0
          </sub>
          is high. If V
          <sub>
           i
          </sub>
          is high enough to drive the transistor into saturation, then V
          <sub>
           0
          </sub>
          is low. When the transistor is not conducting, it is said to be switched off and when it is driven into saturation, it is said to be switched on. This shows that a low input switches the transistor off and a high input switches it on.

          (i) The semiconductor diode used is a Zener diode.

          <img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 14 Semiconductor Electronics Materials Devices and Simple Circuits Class 12 Important Questions 206" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-115140" height="211" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-14-Semiconductor-Electronics-Materials-Devices-and-Simple-Circuits-Class-12-Important-Questions-206.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-14-Semiconductor-Electronics-Materials-Devices-and-Simple-Circuits-Class-12-Important-Questions-206.png 350w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-14-Semiconductor-Electronics-Materials-Devices-and-Simple-Circuits-Class-12-Important-Questions-206-300x181.png 300w" width="350"/>
          <br/>
          (iii) Zener diode as a voltage regulator
          <br/>
          Principle : When a zener diode is operated in the reverse breakdown region, the voltage across it remains practically constant (equal to the breakdown voltage Vz) for a large change in the reverse current. If the input voltage increases, the current through R
          <sub>
           S
          </sub>
          and zener diode also increases. This increases the voltage drop across R
          <sub>
           S
          </sub>
          without any change in the voltage across the zener diode. This is because in the breakdown region, zener voltage remains constant even though the current through the zener diode changes. Similarly, if the input voltage decreases, the voltage across R
          <sub>
           S
          </sub>
          decreases without any change in the voltage across the zener diode. Thus any increase/decrease of the input voltage results in increase/ decrease of the voltage drop across R
          <sub>
           S
          </sub>
          without any change in voltage across zener diode. Hence the zener diode acts as a voltage regulator.

          (i) Why is the current under reverse bias almost independent of the applied potential upto a critical voltage?
          <br/>
          (ii) Why does the reverse current show a sudden increase at the critical voltage.
          <br/>
          Name any semiconductor device which operates under the reverse bias in the breakdown region.
          <br/>
          (All India 2012)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) In reverse bias of p-n junction diode the small current is due to minority carrier and hence resistance is also very high. Increase in voltage leads to a very-very small increase in reverse bias currents so we conclude that in reverse bias reverse current is almost independent of applied potential upto a critical voltage because after this critical voltage, current increases suddenly.

          <br/>
          (ii) In reverse bias, reverse current through junction diode is due to minority charge carriers. As reverse bias voltage is increased, electric field at junction becomes significant. When reverse bias voltage becomes equal to zener voltage, electric field strength across junction becomes high. Electric field across junction is sufficient to pull valence electrons from the atom on p- side and accelerate them towards n-side. The movement of these electrons across the function account for high current which is observed at breakdown reverse voltage. Zener diode and photo diode operate under reverse bias.

          Question 80.
          <br/>
          Write any two distinguishing features between conductors, semiconductors and insulators on the basis of energy band diagrams. (All India 2012)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Distinguishing features between conductors, semiconductors and insulators :
          <br/>
          (i) Insulator. In insulator, the valence band is completely filled. The conduction band is empty and forbidden energy gap is quite large. So no electron is able to go from valence band to conduction band even if electric field is applied. Hence electrical conduction is impossible. The solid/ substance is an insulator.
          <br/>
          (ii) Conductors (Metals). In metals, either the conduction band is partially filled or the conduction and valence band partly overlap each other. If small electric field is applied across the metal, the free electrons start moving in a direction opposite to the direction of electric field. Hence, metal behaves as a conductor.
          <br/>
          (iii) Semiconductors. At absolute zero kelvin, the conduction band is empty and the valence band is filled. The material is insulator at low temperature. However the energy gap between valence band and conduction band is small. At room temperature, some valence electrons acquire thermal energy and jump to conduction band where they can conduct electricity. The holes left behind in valence band act as a positive charge carrier.

          Question 81.
          <br/>
          With what considerations in view, a photodiode is fabricated? State its working with the help of a suitable diagram.
          <br/>
          Even though the current in the forward bias is known to be more than in the reverse bias, yet the photodiode works in reverse bias. What is the reason? (Delhi 2014)

           It is fabricated with a transparent window to allow light to fall on diode.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          (b) Working of photodiode : When the

          ) greater than the energy gap
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           of the semiconductor, electron-holes pairs are generated. These get separated due to the Junction electric field (before they recombine) which produces an emf.

         </p>
         <p>
          (d) Reason. It is easier to observe the change in the current, with change in light intensity, if a reverse bias is applied.

          During the positive half cycle of input signal, the forward bias of emitter-base junction increases.
          <br/>
          Due to increased forward bias, emitter current (I
          <sub>
           E
          </sub>
          ) increases and hence according to equation (i) collector current (I
          <sub>
           C
          </sub>
          ) also increases. Therefore, the voltage drop across R

          Question 87.
          <br/>
          Draw a plot of transfer characteristic (V
          <sub>

          </sub>
          vs V
          <sub>
           i
          </sub>
          and show which portion of the characteristic is used in amplification and why?
          <br/>
          Draw the circuit diagram of base bias transistor amplifier in CE configuration and briefly explain its working. (Comptt. All India 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i)
          <br/>
          Transistor as a switch. The circuit diagram of transistor as a switch is shown in Figure 1. Transfer characteristics. The graph between V
          <sub>
           0
          </sub>
          and V
          <sub>
           i
          </sub>
          is called the transfer characteristics of the base-biased transistor, shown in Figure 2.
         </p>
         <p>
          When the transistor is used in the cut off or saturation state, it acts as a switch.
         </p>
         <p>
          As long as V
          <sub>
           i
          </sub>
          is low and unable to forward bias the transistor, then V
          <sub>
           0
          </sub>
          is high. If V
          <sub>
           i
          </sub>
          is high enough to drive the transistor into saturation, then V
          <sub>
           0
          </sub>
          is low. When the transistor is not conducting, it is said to be switched off and when it is driven into saturation, it is said to be switched on. This shows that a low input switches the transistor off and a high input switches it on.

          <br/>
          During the positive half cycle of input signal, the forward bias of emitter-base junction increases.
          <br/>
          Due to increased forward bias, emitter current (I
          <sub>
           E
          </sub>
          ) increases and hence according to equation (i) collector current (I
          <sub>
           C
          </sub>
          ) also increases. Therefore, the voltage drop across R
          <sub>
           L
          </sub>
          (i.e. I
          <sub>

          R
          <sub>
           L
          </sub>
          ) increases. According to equation (ii), the collector voltage or output voltage (V
          <sub>
           0
          </sub>
          ) decreases. Thus collector is connected to the positive terminal of the battery (V
          <sub>
           CC
          </sub>
          )
          <br/>
          so decrease in V
          <sub>
           0
          </sub>
          means that the collector voltage becomes 1 cm positive. In other words, amplified negative signal is obtained across the output.
          <br/>
          Similarly, during negative hay cycle, an amplified positive signal is obtained across the output.

          Question 88.
          <br/>
          (i) Write the functions of three segments of a transistor.
          <br/>
          (ii) Draw the circuit diagram for studying the input and output characteristics of n-p-n transistor in common emitter configuration. Using the circuit, explain how input, output characteristics are obtained. (Delhi 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i)
          <br/>
          (a) All the three segments of a transistor have different thickness and their doping levels are also different. A brief description of the three segments of a transistor is given below :
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Emitter: This is the segment on one side of the transistor. It is of moderate size and heavily doped. It supplies a large number of majority carriers for the current flow through the transistor.
          </li>
          <li>
           Base : This is the central segment. It is very thin and lightly doped.
          </li>
          <li>
           Collector : This segment collects a major portion of the majority carriers supplied by the emitter. The collector side is moderately doped and larger in size as compared to the emitter.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          (ii)
          <br/>
          Common emitter (CE) transistor characteristics. The transistor is most widely used in the CE configuration. When a transistor is used in CE configuration, the input is between the base and emitter and the output is between the collector and emitter.
          <br/>
          The input and the output characteristics of an n-p-n transistor in CE configuration can be studied by using the circuit as shown in Figure 1.

          Question 89.
          <br/>
          (i) Explain with the help of a diagram the formation of depletion region and barrier potential in a pn junction.
          <br/>
          (ii) Draw the circuit diagram of a half wave rectifier and explain its working. (All India 2016)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) (i) Depletion layer. The layer containing unneutralized acceptor and donor ion across a p-n junction is called depletion layer. It is called depletion layer because it is depleted of mobile charge carriers.
          <br/>
          (ii) Barrier potential. The electric field between the acceptor and donor ions is called the barrier. The difference of potential from one side of the barrier to the other side is called barrier potential.
          <br/>
          (i) The increase of doping concentration will reduce width of depletion layer in semi conductor.
          <br/>
          (ii) depletion layer widens under reverse bias and vice versa.
         </p>

          (b) Rectifier. A rectifier is a circuit which converts an alternating current into direct current.
          <br/>
          p-n diode as a half wave rectifier. A half wave rectifier consists of a single diode as shown in the circuit diagram. The secondary of the transformer gives the desired a.c. voltage across A and B.
          <br/>
          In the positive half cycle of a.c., the voltage at A is positive, the diode is forward biased and it conducts current.

          Question 91.
          <br/>
          Give reasons for the following :
          <br/>
          (i) High reverse voltage do not appear across a LED.
          <br/>
          (ii) Sunlight is not always required for the working of a solar cell.
          <br/>
          (ill) The electric field, of the junction of a Zener diode, is very high even for a small reverse bias voltage of about 5V. (Comptt. Delhi 2016)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) It is because reverse breakdown voltage of LED is very low, i.e., nearly 5V.
          <br/>
          (ii) Solar cell can work with any light whose photon energy is more than the band gap energy.
          <br/>
          (iii) The heavy doping of p and n sides of pn junction makes the depletion region very thin, hence for a small reverse bias voltage, electric field is very high.

          Question 92.
          <br/>
          It is required to design a (two-input) logic gate, using an appropriate number, of :
          <br/>
          (a) NAND gates that gives a ‘low’ output only when both the inputs are ‘low’.
          <br/>
          (b) NOR gates that gives a ‘high’ output only when both the inputs are ‘high’.
          <br/>
          Draw the logic circuits for these two cases and write the truth table, corresponding to each of the two designs. (Comptt. All India 2017)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) The ‘NAND’ gate that gives a ‘low’ output only when both its inputs are low, is an ‘OR’ gate

         <p>
          Due to the diffusion of electrons and holes across the junction, a region of (immobile) positive charge is created on the n-side and a region of (immobile) negative charge is created on the p-side, near the junction; this is called depletion region.
         </p>
         <p>
          Barrier potential is formed due to loss of electrons from n-region and gain of electrons by p-region. Its polarity is such that it opposes the movement of charge carriers across the junction.

          A zener diode is fabricated by heavily doping both p- and n-sides of the junction. Explain, why? Briefly explain the use of zener diode as a dc voltage regulator with the help of a circuit diagram. ‘ (Delhi 2017)

          From the V-I characteristics of a junction diode, it is clear that it allows the current to pass only when it is forward biased. So when an alternatively voltage is applied across the diode, current flows only during that part of the cycle when it is forward biased.

          During the positive half cycle of input signal, the forward bias of emitter-base junction increases.
          <br/>
          Due to increased forward bias, emitter current (I
          <sub>
           E
          </sub>
          ) increases and hence according to equation (i) collector current (I
          <sub>
           C
          </sub>
          ) also increases. Therefore, the voltage drop across R

          Question 103.
          <br/>
          Explain the two processes involved in the formulation of a p-n junction diode. Hence define the term ‘barrier potential’. (Comptt. Delhi 2017)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Two important processes that occur during the formation of a p-n junction are
          <br/>
          (i) diffusion and
          <br/>
          (ii) drift.
          <br/>
          (i) Diffusion: In n-type semiconductor, the concentration of electrons is much greater as compared to concentration of holes; while in p-type semiconductor, the concentration of holes is much greater than the concentration of electrons. When a p-n junction is formed, then due to concentration gradient, the holes diffuse from p side to n side (p ➝ n) and electrons diffuse from n side to p-side (n ➝ p). This motion of charge carriers gives rise to diffusion current across the junction.

         </p>
         <p>
          (ii) Drift: The drift of charge carriers occurs due to electric field. Due to built in potential barrier an electric field directed from n-region to p-region is developed across the junction. This field causes motion of electrons on p-side of the junction to n-side and motion of holes on n-side of junction to p-side. Thus a drift current starts. This current is opposite to the direction of diffusion current.

          Question 107.
          <br/>
          Draw the circuit diagram of a full wave rectifier. Explain its working principle. Draw the input and output waveforms. (Comptt. All India 2017)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Working of a full wave rectifier :
          <br/>
          1. A full wave rectifier uses two diodes and gives the rectified output voltage corresponding to both the positive and negative half-cycle of alternating current.
          <br/>
          2. The p-side of the two diodes are connected to the ends of the secondary of the transformer and, the n-sides of the diodes are connected together.
          <br/>
          3. Output is taken from between the common- point of the two diodes and secondary of the transformer. Hence, the secondary of the transformer is provided with center tapping and is also called the centre-tap transformer.
          <br/>
          4. Let, the input voltage to A with respect to the centre be positive and, at the same instant, voltage at B being out-of-phase will be negative. Therefore, diode D
          <sub>
           1
          </sub>
          is forward biased and starts conducting whereas, D
          <sub>
           2
          </sub>
          being reverse biased does not conduct.
          <br/>
          <img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 14 Semiconductor Electronics Materials Devices and Simple Circuits Class 12 Important Questions 136" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-114692" height="427" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-14-Semiconductor-Electronics-Materials-Devices-and-Simple-Circuits-Class-12-Important-Questions-136.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-14-Semiconductor-Electronics-Materials-Devices-and-Simple-Circuits-Class-12-Important-Questions-136.png 288w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-14-Semiconductor-Electronics-Materials-Devices-and-Simple-Circuits-Class-12-Important-Questions-136-202x300.png 202w" width="288"/>
          <br/>
          5. Thus, we get an output current and an output voltage across the load resistance RL in the first positive half-cycle.
          <br/>
          6. During the course of the negative half-cycle, that is, when voltage at A becomes negative and voltage at B becomes positive, we will have D
          <sub>
           1
          </sub>
          as reverse biased and D
          <sub>
           2
          </sub>
          forward biased.
          <br/>
          7. In the negative part of the cycle, only diode D
          <sub>
           2
          </sub>
          will conduct giving an output current and output voltage across R
          <sub>
           L
          </sub>
          .
          <br/>
          8. For both positive and negative half cycle we will get the output voltage. This rectified output voltage has the shape of half sinusoids.

          Light Emitting Diode (LED) : A light emitting diode is simply a forward biased p-n junction which emits spontaneous light radiation. When forward bias is applied, the electron and holes at the junction recombine and energy released is emitted in the form of light. V-I characteristics of LED are similar to that of Si junction diode but the threshold voltages are much higher and slightly different for each colour. No conduction or light emission occurs for reverse bias which, if it exceeds 5V, may damage the LED.

          The input (base-emitter) circuit is forward biased and the output circuit (collector- emitter) is reverse biased.

          <br/>
          When an a.c. signal is fed to the input circuit, the forward bias increases during the positive half cycle of the input. This results in increase in I
          <sub>

          Question 110.
          <br/>
          How is a zener diode fabricated so as to make it a special purpose diode? Draw I-V characteristics of zener diode and explain the significance of breakdown voltage.
          <br/>
          Explain briefly, with the help of a circuit diagram, how a p-n junction diode works as a half wave rectifier.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Zener diode is fabricated by heavily doping both p and n-sides. Due to this, depletion region formed is very thin (&lt; 10
          <sup>
           -6
          </sup>
          n and the electric field of the junction is extremely high (~5 × 10
          <sup>
           6
          </sup>
          V / m) even for a small reverse bias voltage of 5 volts. It is seen that when the applied reverse bias voltage (V) reaches the breakdown voltage (Vz) of the Zener diode, there is a large change in the current. After the breakdown voltage Vz, a large change in the current can be produced by almost insignificant change in the reverse bias voltage. In other words, Zener voltage remains constant even though current through the Zener diode varies over a wide range.
         </p>
         <p>
          This property of the Zener diode is used for regulating voltages so that they are constant. Semiconductor diode as a half wave Rectifier : The junction diode D, supplies rectified current to the band during one half of the alternating input voltage and is always in the same direction. During the first half cycles of the alternating input voltage, junction diodes D
          <sub>
           1
          </sub>
          will conduct each permitting current to flow during one half cycle whenever its p-terminal is positive with respect to the n-terminal.

          (c) Identify the logic gate represented by the circuit as shown and write its truth table. (Delhi 2017)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a)
          <br/>
          As soon as a p-n junction is formed, the majority charge carriers begin to diffuse from the regions of higher concentration to the regions of lower concentrations. Thus the electrons from the n-region diffuse into the p-region and where they combine with the holes and get neutralised. Similarly, the holes from the p-region diffuse into the n-region where they combine with the electrons and get neutralised. This process is called electron-hole recombination.

          <br/>
          The p-region near the junction is left with immobile -ve ions and n-region near the junction is left with +ve ions as shown in the figure. The small region in the vicinity of the junction which is depleted of free charge carriers and has only immobile ions is called the depletion layer. In the depletion region, a potential difference VB is created, called potential barrier as it creates an electric field which opposes the further diffusion of electrons and holes.
          <br/>
          (i) In forward biased, the width of depletion region is decreased.
          <br/>

          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a)
          <br/>
          Principle of transistor oscillator : “Sustained a.c. signals can he obtained from an amplifier circuit without any external input signal by giving a positive feedback to the input circuit through inductive coupling or RC/LC network.”

         </p>
         <p>
          Using the circuit arrangements shown in fig. (i) and fig (ii), we study the variation of current with applied voltage to obtain the V-I characteristics.
          <br/>
          From the V-I characteristics of a junction diode, it is clear that it allows the current to pass only when it is forward biased. So when an alternatively voltage is applied across the diode, current flows only during that part of the cycle when it is forward biased.

          (b) Light emitting diode (LED) is a heavily doped p-n junction which under forward bias emits spontaneous radiations.

          p-n junction diode as full wave rectifier
          <br/>
          A full wave rectifier consists of two diodes and special type of transformer known as centre tap transformer as shown in the circuit. The secondary of transformer gives the desired a.c. voltage across A and B.
          <br/>
          During the positive half cycle of a.c. input, the diode D
          <sub>

          is in forward bias and conducts current while D
          <sub>
           2
          </sub>
          is in reverse biased and does not conduct current. So we get an output voltage across the load resistor R

          Question 117.
          <br/>
          (a) Describe briefly, with the help of a diagram, the role of the two important processes involved in the formation of a p-n junction:
          <br/>
          (b) Name the device which is used as a voltage regulator. Draw the necessary circuit diagram and explain its working. (All India 2012)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Two important processes that occur during the formation of a p-n junction are
          <br/>
          (i) diffusion and
          <br/>
          (ii) drift.
          <br/>
          (i) Diffusion: In n-type semiconductor, the concentration of electrons is much greater as compared to concentration of holes; while in p-type semiconductor, the concentration of holes is much greater than the concentration of electrons. When a p-n junction is formed, then due to concentration gradient, the holes diffuse from p side to n side (p ➝ n) and electrons diffuse from n side to p-side (n ➝ p). This motion of charge carriers gives rise to diffusion current across the junction.
          <br/>

         </p>
         <p>
          (ii) Drift: The drift of charge carriers occurs due to electric field. Due to built in potential barrier an electric field directed from n-region to p-region is developed across the junction. This field causes motion of electrons on p-side of the junction to n-side and motion of holes on n-side of junction to p-side. Thus a drift current starts. This current is opposite to the direction of diffusion current.

          (b) Zener diode is used as voltage regulator.
          <br/>
          <img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 14 Semiconductor Electronics Materials Devices and Simple Circuits Class 12 Important Questions 161" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-114735" height="151" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 367px) 100vw, 367px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-14-Semiconductor-Electronics-Materials-Devices-and-Simple-Circuits-Class-12-Important-Questions-161.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-14-Semiconductor-Electronics-Materials-Devices-and-Simple-Circuits-Class-12-Important-Questions-161.png 367w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-14-Semiconductor-Electronics-Materials-Devices-and-Simple-Circuits-Class-12-Important-Questions-161-300x123.png 300w" width="367"/>
          <br/>
          Any increase/decrease in the input voltage results in increase/decrease of the voltage drop across Rs without any change in voltage across the zener diode. Thus, the zener diode acts as a voltage regulator.

          Question 120.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a)
          <br/>
          As soon as a p-n junction is formed, the majority charge carriers begin to diffuse from the regions of higher concentration to the regions of lower concentrations. Thus the electrons from the n-region diffuse into the p-region and where they combine with the holes and get neutralised. Similarly, the holes from the p-region diffuse into the n-region where they combine with the electrons and get neutralised. This process is called electron-hole recombination.

          <br/>
          The p-region near the junction is left with immobile -ve ions and n-region near the junction is left with +ve ions as shown in the figure. The small region in the vicinity of the junction which is depleted of free charge carriers and has only immobile ions is called the depletion layer. In the depletion region, a potential difference VB is created, called potential barrier as it creates an electric field which opposes the further diffusion of electrons and holes.
          <br/>
          (i) In forward biased, the width of depletion region is decreased.
          <br/>
          (ii) In reverse biased, the width of depletion region is increased.

          (b) Device ‘X’ given here represents the full wave rectifier.

          are formed biased and reverse biased alternately. During half cycle of A.C. input, current flows through one crystal diode and during the next half cycle the current flows through the other crystal diode. However across the load R

          (ii) output characteristics in this configuration.
          <br/>
          (c) Describe briefly how the output characteristics can be used to obtain the current gain in the transistor. (Comptt. Delhi 2012)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) The base is made very thin so as to control current flowing between emitter and collector. The base is lightly doped to make a thin depletion layer between emitter and collector.

          When the transistor is used in the cut off or saturation state, it acts as a switch.
          <br/>
          As long as V; is loio and unable to forward bias the transistor, then V0 is high. If V; is high enough to drive the transistor into saturation, then V0 is low. When the transistor is not conducting, it is said to be sivitched off and when it is driven into saturation, it is said to be switched on. This shows that a low input switches the transistor off and a high input switches it on.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) p-n junction and depletion regions. Two processes involved during the formation of p-n junction are diffusion and drift. Due to the concentration gradient, across p and n sides of the junction, holes diffuse from p ➝ n, and electrons from n ➝ p. This movement of charge carriers leaves behind ionised acceptors on the p-side and donors on the n-side of the junction. This space charge region on either side of the junction, together, is known as depletion region.

          Using the circuit arrangements shown in fig. (i) and fig (ii), we study the variation of current with applied voltage to obtain the V-I characteristics.
          <br/>
          From the V-I characteristics of a junction diode, it is clear that it allows the current to pass only when it is forward biased. So when an alternatively voltage is applied across the diode, current flows only during that part of the cycle when it is forward biased.
         </p>
         <p>
          “These characteristic make use of p-n junction diode as a rectifier. In the positive half cycle of ac, the voltage is positive and the diode is forward biassed and it conducts current. While in the negative half cycle of ac, the voltage is negative, the diode is reverse biassed and it does not conduct current. Thus we get rectified output during positive half cycles only. The output is unidirectional, but varying.”

          Question 126.

          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) All the three segments of a transistor have different thickness and their doping levels are also different. A brief description of the three segments of a transistor is given below :
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Emitter: This is the segment on one side of the transistor. It is of moderate size and heavily doped. It supplies a large number of majority carriers for the current flow through the transistor.
          </li>
          <li>
           Base : This is the central segment. It is very thin and lightly doped.
          </li>
          <li>
           Collector : This segment collects a major portion of the majority carriers supplied by the emitter. The collector side is moderately doped and larger in size as compared to the emitter.
          </li>
         </ul>

          <br/>
          During the positive half cycle of input signal, the forward bias of emitter-base junction increases. Due to increased forward bias, emitter current (I
          <sub>
           E
          </sub>
          ) increases and hence according to equation (i) collector current (I
          <sub>
           C
          </sub>
          ) also increases. Therefore, the voltage drop across R

           L

          (i.e. I

          <sub>
           0
          </sub>
          ) decreases. Thus collector is connected to the positive terminal of the battery (V

          Similarly, during negative hay cycle, an amplified positive signal is obtained across the output.

          (a) Explain with the help of a diagram, how a depletion layer and barrier potential are formed in a junction diode.
          <br/>
          (b) Draw a circuit diagram of a full wave rectifier. Explain its working and draw input and output waveforms. (Comptt. Delhi 2012)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a)
          <br/>
          As soon as a p-n junction is formed, the majority charge carriers begin to diffuse from the regions of higher concentration to the regions of lower concentrations. Thus the electrons from the n-region diffuse into the p-region and where they combine with the holes and get neutralised. Similarly, the holes from the p-region diffuse into the n-region where they combine with the electrons and get neutralised. This process is called electron-hole recombination.

          <br/>
          The p-region near the junction is left with immobile -ve ions and n-region near the junction is left with +ve ions as shown in the figure. The small region in the vicinity of the junction which is depleted of free charge carriers and has only immobile ions is called the depletion layer. In the depletion region, a potential difference VB is created, called potential barrier as it creates an electric field which opposes the further diffusion of electrons and holes.
          <br/>
          (i) In forward biased, the width of depletion region is decreased.
          <br/>
          (ii) In reverse biased, the width of depletion region is increased.

          Using the circuit arrangements shown in fig. (i) and fig (ii), we study the variation of current with applied voltage to obtain the V-I characteristics.
          <br/>
          From the V-I characteristics of a junction diode, it is clear that it allows the current to pass only when it is forward biased. So when an alternatively voltage is applied across the diode, current flows only during that part of the cycle when it is forward biased.

          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) In a p-n-p transitor, the heavily doped emitter which is p-type has a majority charge carrier of holes. These holes when move towards 21-type base get neutralized by e
          <sup>
           –
          </sup>
          in base. The majority carriers enter the base region in large numbers. As the base is thin and lightly doped, the majority carriers (holes) swamp the small number of electrons there and as the collector is reverse biased, these holes can easily cross the junction and enter the collector.

          (b) donor impurity? Hence discuss why the ‘holes’, and the ‘electrons’ respectively, become the ‘majority charge carriers’ in these two cases? Write the two processes involved in the formation of p-n junction. (Comptt. All India 2015)

          <br/>
          Distinguishing features between conductors, semiconductors and insulators :
          <br/>
          (i) Insulator. In insulator, the valence band is completely filled. The conduction band is empty and forbidden energy gap is quite large. So no electron is able to go from valence band to conduction band even if electric field is applied. Hence electrical conduction is impossible. The solid/ substance is an insulator.

          (ii) Conductors (Metals). In metals, either the conduction band is partially filled or the conduction and valence band partly overlap each other. If small electric field is applied across the metal, the free electrons start moving in a direction opposite to the direction of electric field. Hence, metal behaves as a conductor.
         </p>
         <p>
          (iii) Semiconductors. At absolute zero kelvin, the conduction band is empty and the valence band is filled. The material is insulator at low temperature. However the energy gap between valence band and conduction band is small. At room temperature, some valence electrons acquire thermal energy and jump to conduction band where they can conduct electricity. The holes left behind in valence band act as a positive charge carrier.

          <br/>
          (a) When the semiconductor is doped with an acceptor impurity, thereby results in an additional energy level a little above the top of the valence band.
          <br/>
          (b) The donor impurity results in an additional energy level a little below the bottom of the
          <br/>
          conduction band.
         </p>
         <p>
          In the first case, electrons from the valence band, easily jump over to the acceptor lelvel, leaving ‘holes’ behind. Hence, ‘holes’ becomes the majority charge carriers.
         </p>
         <p>
          In the second case, electrons from the donor level, easily ‘jump over’ to the conduction band. Hence, electrons become the majority charge carriers. The two processes involved in the formation of the p-n junction are :
          <br/>
          (i) Diffusion
          <br/>
          (ii) Drift

          Question 134.
          <br/>
          (a) Draw the diagram of the ‘circuit arrangement used for studying the ‘input’ and ‘output’ characteristics of an n-p-n transistor in its CE configuration’. Briefly explain how these two types of characteristics are obtained and draw these characteristics.
          <br/>
          (b) ‘Define’ the terms,
          <br/>
          (i) Input resistance
          <br/>
          (ii) Output resistance
          <br/>
          (iii) Current amplification factor, for a given transistor. (Comptt. All India 2015)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a)
          <br/>
          Common emitter (CE) transistor characteristics. The transistor is most widely used in the CE configuration. When a transistor is used in CE configuration, the input is between the base and emitter and the output is between the collector and emitter.
          <br/>
          The input and the output characteristics of an n-p-n transistor in CE configuration can be studied by using the circuit as shown in Figure 1.
