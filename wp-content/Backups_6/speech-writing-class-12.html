          Speech Writing Class 12 Format, Examples, Topics, Samples
         </h2>
         <p>
          A Speech is a formal talk that a person delivers to his audience. It must have the capacity to hold the attention of the audience with a proper choice of words, expressions and examples. At the same time care should be taken not to deviate from the main subject. You must keep in mind that it is a speech and you need to begin the draft with addressing the audience and conclusion should be with a sentence thanking the audience.
         </p>
         <p>
          ♦ Remember:
         </p>
         <p>
          WHO you are writing the speech for (i.e., who your audience is).
          <br/>
          WHAT your speech is going to be about (its topic) and the main points in order of importance.
         </p>
         <div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
         </div>
         <p>
          ♦ Note:
          <br/>
          It is important to note that the written speech should consist of small sentences having not more than 10 to 12 words in a sentence.
         </p>
         <p>
          ♦ Value Points:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Greet your audience and introduce the topic you are speaking on.
          </li>
          <li>
           The introduction part of the speech is the most important part.
          </li>
          <li>
           It is this part which decides the impact of the speech.
          </li>
          <li>
           Do not give a separate title for the speech.
          </li>
          <li>
           Keep in mind, as already stated, the occasion of the speech and the nature of the audience.
          </li>
          <li>
           The introduction should not be very lengthy.
          </li>
          <li>
           The main topic should be taken up as quickly as possible.
          </li>
          <li>
           Use concrete terms and tangible examples.
          </li>
          <li>
           Avoid abstract phrases which are quite vague.
          </li>
          <li>
           Use simple and familiar language.
          </li>
          <li>
           The conclusion plays a very important role in the success of a speech.
          </li>
          <li>
           Give your own conclusion on the topic in a telling manner.
          </li>
          <li>
           Marking scheme is the same as for the Article.
          </li>
          <li>
           Write ‘Thank you’ at the end of your speech.
          </li>
         </ul>

          Question 1.
          <br/>
          Nowadays just about everyone owns a cellphone but most of the users do not follow even the basic rules of cellphone conduct. They are seen speaking loudly, taking a phone call in the middle of a meeting or even at a funeral etc. Write a speech in 150-200 words to be delivered in the assembly of your school to appraise the fellow students of cellphone etiquette. (Comptt. All India 2011)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Nowadays almost everyone owns a mobile phone but many users have no knowledge of the basic rules of cellphone conduct. Good Morning everyone, I, ABC, have come before you all to apprise you of cellphone etiquette. It is actually necessary to follow a few guidelines regarding the use of cellphones. Your cellphone does not have to go everywhere you go. There . are times when you should never answer your cellphone, especially in places of worship and funeral homes. At the very best they should be on the vibrate mode in these places. Use your quiet inside voice and do not yell into your cellphone. Be courteous to others’ right of not being disturbed by your megaphone range voice. In social situations where you are entertaining friends or clients, do not have long cellphone conversations as it gives the impression that you do not value the time and presence of the person in front of you. If your phone rings while you are driving, wait till you have pulled over before you answer or return the call. Your life and the life of the people around you is of much more value than your phone call. Be a responsible cellphone user, be aware of your surroundings before making or receiving a call and have respect for those around you. This will help others to appreciate your good judgement and consideration.
          <br/>
          Thank you!

          Question 2.
          <br/>
          Regular practice of yoga can help in maintaining good health and even in the prevention Writing Skills 121 of so many ailments. Write a speech in 150-200 words to be delivered in the morning assembly on the usefulness of yoga. (Delhi 2012)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Good morning Respected Principal Maam, Teachers and Dear Friends. I, ABC, have come before you all to speak on the usefulness of yoga. Yoga means the experience of unity with one’s inner being. Yoga is the Sanskrit word for “union”.
         </p>
         <p>
          It has been a practice that uses postures and breathing techniques to induce relaxation and improve strength. In the last few years, the benefits of yoga have gained acknowledgement and popularity the world over. Yoga has now become a way of life with the aim ‘a healthy mind in a healthy body.’ Man is a physical, mental and spiritual being and yoga helps to promote a balanced development of all the three.
         </p>
         <p>
          Other forms of exercises like aerobics, jogging etc. assure only physical well-being. They have little to do with the development of the spiritual body. Yogic exercises recharge the body with cosmic energy which facilitates attainment of perfect equilibrium and harmony, promotes self-healing, removes negative blocks from the mind and toxins from the body and also reduces stress and tension. One feels rejuvenated and energised with yoga. Yoga’s popularity worldwide is because people have realised the essence of self-contentment and inner peace and understand that yoga is the only and best way to attain these two essentials. Yoga also helps in the prevention of ailments like hypertension, diabetes, arthritis etc. With its numerous benefits to control the body and the mind the usefulness of yoga cannot be denied or overlooked.

          Question 3.
          <br/>
          You are Rajendra Kumar, a social worker. You read an article in The Hindu on ‘Health Care for Indian Workers’. Write a speech in 125-150 words on the importance of health care to be delivered at a public function to create awareness among the workers. (Delhi 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          It is indeed unfortunate that despite the fact that the Indian workers form a majority of the population the health care available to them is by far most lacking.
         </p>
         <p>
          Good morning everyone! I, Rajendra Kumar, am a social worker and I have come before you all to talk about the importance of health care for Indian workers.
         </p>
         <div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
         </div>
         <p>
          I strongly feel that a coherent and sustainable plan that addresses the health care needs of Indian workers is strikingly absent. In spite of substantial economic growth in India, its benefits have not been inclusive and our country still faces large disparities in terms of health care of workers. This inequity in health care access across demographic segments within the population needs to be tackled. It is an acknowledged fact that out of pocket health expenditure caused due to lack of access to adequate public health care is preventing a large section of our workforce from not only climbing above the poverty line but also pushing a large section of their lot below the line.
         </p>
         <p>
          The need of the present time is for us, the general public, to put pressure on our respective political representatives and hold them accountable so that they take improvement in health care for Indian workers as a top priority.
         </p>
         <p>
          Thank you!

          Question 4.
          <br/>
          Media has a stronghold on society. Write a speech in 125-150 words on how media influences public opinion to be delivered in the school assembly. (Delhi 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Over the last two decades, the influence of media has grown exponentially. We trust the media as an authority for news and information.
         </p>
         <p>
          Good Morning! Respected Principal, Teachers and Dear Friends. I, have come before you all to talk about media’s strong influence on public opinion.
         </p>
         <p>
          Media reflects and projects the view of a minority elite, which controls it. Society is influenced by the media. This media not only helps public to get information about a lot of things but also makes them form opinions and make judgement regarding so many issues. Media limits the thinking capacity of people and affects the youth in the society who lack in experience and sometimes blindly believe in what they see or hear. And many times the news covered is over-exaggerated and sensationalized and this diverts public attention away from the actual problem. The media also has the ability to influence society by broadcasting what they believe you should see.
         </p>
         <p>
          The media can thus form or modify public opinion in different ways depending on what their objective is. So it is our duty as enlightened citizens to not let ourselves be misled.
         </p>
         <p>
          Thank You!

          Question 5.
          <br/>
          You are Sampreet, an educationist. You have noticed that the youth of today are often unable to cope with stress and become frustrated and bitter. Write a speech in 125-150 words to be delivered at a college function on ‘Youth, their problems and solutions’. (Delhi 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          As you all are aware that in the present scenario the youth of today are often unable to cope with stress, and as a result become frustrated and bitter.
         </p>
         <p>
          Good Morning Everyone! I, Sampreet, am an educationist and have come before you all to talk about ‘Youth, their problems and solutions’.
         </p>
         <p>
          Today’s youth is faced with many problems which include a high level of competition in studies, career and jobs. Combined with this an equally high level of self and parents’ expectations, materialistic pursuits, peer pressure, a gap between what they aspire for and what they achieve. As a result of these mounting problems, youngsters face various emotional disorders like frustration, bitterness, depression etc. which in turn affect their physical, mental and emotional health. Such problems need to be tackled so that youngsters can lead a stress-free life. The youth need to be given proper counselling, their confidence needs to be developed, they also need to know their own potential, interest and priorities. All this can be achieved through meditation and Yoga and by pursuing various hobbies.
         </p>
         <p>
          We need to encourage youngsters to lead stress-free lives so as to enable them to lead contented and happy lives.
         </p>
         <p>
          Thank you!

          Question 6.
          <br/>
          After Independence India has seen a steep upward trend in the graph of corruption. The public has often become disgusted and disappointed. As Venkat, a well-known journalist, write a speech in 150-200 words on ‘Corruption, its causes and solutions’. (Delhi)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          After independence, India has seen a steep upward trend in the graph of corruption. As a result of this the public has often become disgusted and disappointed.
         </p>
         <p>
          Good Morning Everyone, I, Venkat, a journalist have come before you all to talk about ‘corruption’, its causes and solutions’.
         </p>
         <p>
          The causes of corruption in India include excessive greed, materialistic pursuits, no fear of law, lack of deterrence, lack of role models, deterioration of moral and ethical standards, misuse of power and authority, peer and societal pressure etc. Corruption has a severe negative impact on the economy so it needs to be tackled with severity. We, as responsible citizens of India, need to raise our voice against corruption and exploitation and for that strict vigilance and laws are needed. Our judiciary should be given more independence and initiatives on issues related to corruption. NGOs and the media need to come forward to create awareness against corruption in society. Strong anti-corruption law and mechanism with the grit to make it work are crucial if we want to fight corruption effectively.
         </p>
         <p>
          Finally, I conclude my speech by reiterating the need that each and every citizen of India should take an oath to deal with corruption on a very severe basis so as to discourage it at all levels.
         </p>
         <p>
          Thank you!

          Question 7.
          <br/>
          Mobile phone of today is no longer a mere means of communication. Music lovers are so glued to it that they don’t pay attention even to the traffic while crossing the roads. This leads to accidents, sometimes even fatal ones. Write a speech in 150-200 words to be delivered in the morning assembly advising the students to be careful in the use of this otherwise very useful gadget. Imagine you are the Principal of your school. (Delhi 2015)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Mobile phones of today are not just a means of communication. Music lovers are so glued to it that it distracts them even while they are crossing the roads and this can lead to accidents which could be fatal.
         </p>
         <p>
          Good Morning students, I, your Principal would like to advise you all to be careful in the use of this otherwise very useful gadget. A mobile phone undoubtedly serves many purposes other than making calls. It may be used as a radio/music player, camera, for surfing the internet, watching TV etc.
         </p>
         <p>
          However, this wonder device may cause major distractions and leads to fatal accidents. Road safety researches have shown that people, especially youngsters, risk their lives by listening to music on their earphones while crossing the road. Unlike driving, which is completely under regulations and usage of earphones is strictly banned, walking with earphones is not covered by the law and thus for many of us listening to music on our mobile phones is an everyday part of life.
         </p>
         <p>
          We all are aware that all road crossings require pedestrians to use their eyes and ears and make judgements of speed and driver intention and then decide when is it safe to cross. When you are listening to music, your attention and reflexes are majorly diverted. This distraction can interfere with your decision-making and sometimes even prove fatal. Apart from this, overexposure to radiation emitted by mobile phones may cause cancer and other serious problems. I would like to conclude my speech with the hope that my students will ensure their own safety in this regard and will spread this word of advise to others also.
         </p>
         <p>
          Thank you!

          Question 8.
          <br/>
          Power shortage has become a norm even in the metropolitan cities. One way to face this situation is by preventing the wastage of power. Write a speech in 150-200 words on the importance of power in our daily life and how to save power at school and at home. Imagine that you are the Principal of your school. (Delhi 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Power shortage has become a norm in rural as well as urban India. We need to find a remedy to this situation by preventing the wastage of power.
         </p>
         <p>
          Good Morning students, I, your Principal would like to talk to you about the importance of power in our daily lives and how we can save power at home and at school.
         </p>
         <p>
          Power or electricity lights up our homes, all household appliances and equipment are powered by electricity from fans, TVs, lights, geysers, phones etc. We all know that electricity requires a source to power it. These sources are natural resources such as coal, gas and oil. These resources are quickly disappearing because they are being used at a much faster pace than they can be replenished. So the need of the hour is to save power.
          <br/>
          As children, you too can do your bit in saving power at home and at school. You must ensure that lights and fans are turned off in unoccupied rooms both at home and at school. Keep your classroom doors closed as this will help prevent cool or warm air from escaping. Check that none of the taps around you are dripping and help to save water also. We are also planning to start an ‘Energy club’ in our school. In its meetings students can give inputs on different ways to save energy.
         </p>
         <p>
          I conclude my speech with the hope that you will also give valuable tips to others—your parents, neighbours, relatives, on how they too can do their bit in saving power which is so important in our daily life.
         </p>
         <p>
          Thank You!

          Question 9.
          <br/>
          Today’s children are not yet aware of many opportunities awaiting them after they complete their school education. As an aca-demic counsellor give a talk to the students of St Antony’s School on the need for career guidance and how knowledge of the available careers can benefit the youth. Write the speech in 150-200 words. (Comptt. Delhi 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          It is most unfortunate that despite the many opportunities that are awaiting you after you complete your school education many of you are not aware about them.
         </p>
         <p>
          Good Morning children. I, an academic counsellor, have come before you all to talk about the need for career guidance.
         </p>
         <p>
          The first and foremost thing that all of you should keep in mind is that the decision about what you want to do in life should be your own. Do not succumb to peer and parental pressure. Choosing a career is not a serious affair until your high school. But once you are done with high school, it becomes imperative to choose a definite career goal. At this time you can seek the help of a qualified career counsellor who can assist you in discovering your potential and aptitude and accordingly suggest the right course.
         </p>
         <p>
          Sometimes despite having a clear idea of what you aspire to achieve in life some students are not sure about the career path they need to follow to have the requisite academic qualification to join a particular course. Career counselling can help you clear these doubts. So, students, I would like to reiterate that career guidance provides essential support and boosts the morale of students by helping them to overcome preconceived notions about certain fields.
         </p>
         <p>
          I would like to conclude on the note that the crux of career guidance is to provide the necessary counselling that is bound to help students in making the right choice about their career.
         </p>
         <p>
          Thank You!

          Question 10.
          <br/>
          The Prime Minister’s campaign, ‘Swachh Bharat’ has become popular throughout India. Inspired by this, you, the principal of a reputed school decide to address the students on ‘The value of cleanliness’. Write your speech in 150-200 words. (Comptt. All India)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The Prime Minister’s campaign ‘Swachh Bharat’ has become popular throughout India. It is India’s biggest ever cleanliness drive and aims to accomplish the vision of ‘Clean India’ by 2nd October 2019, Gandhiji’s 150th birthday. Good Morning children, I have come before you all to talk about ‘The value of cleanliness’. The importance of cleanliness cannot be ignored in individual as well as communal life. On the one hand it is an important factor for human health and spiritual development; on the other hand it is essential for environmental development. Cleanliness is one of the ‘must-have’ habits in all individuals. The high value attached to cleanliness is aptly expressed by the proverb, “Cleanliness is next to Godliness”.
         </p>
         <p>
          We all need to do our bit to keep our surroundings and environment clean. Shrugging off our shoulders of the litter and dirt, cursing the government and civic agencies is just not right. Living in a society, we all have a moral responsibility to contribute to our surroundings. Set a good example and do not litter on roads and public places. Use dustbins and keep your surroundings clean. Cleanliness is a part of civilization and as civilized beings our foremost duty is to understand the value of cleanliness. To conclude, I quote the words of Mahatma Gandhi, “Sanitation is more important than independence”.
         </p>
         <p>
          Thank You!

          Question 11.
          <br/>
          You have always been proud of being a citizen of the country which shows love and care for elders. However, now this value is found to be disappearing. Write a speech in 150-200 words on ‘Difficulties faced by senior citizens/ (Comptt. All India)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          We have always been proud of being citizens of a country which shows love, compassion and care for elders. However now this value seems to be disappearing.
         </p>
         <p>
          Good morning everyone, I have come before you all to talk about the “Difficulties faced by senior citizens.” Deteriorating health, malnutrition, lack of shelter, financial incapacity are some of the most common problems that senior citizens face. Combined with these are isolation, rejection by family and callous attitude of their children. The number of ‘living alone’ seniors has also increased in recent times as seniors with non-resident children or out of station children are forced to live alone. In today’s materialistic world, where everyone is over-busy, it amounts to too much expectation if senior citizens expect their kith and kin to attend to their requirements or pay them frequent visits.
         </p>
         <p>
          The problems faced by senior citizens need to be tackled through holistic care, that is by paying attention to the preventive, promotive and rehabilitative aspects of caring for them. Moreover, awareness needs to be created regarding elderly persons that can help them to lead productive and independent lives. With a view to ensure the well-being of senior citizens we need to strengthen their legitimate place in society and extend support for financial security and health care. Let us not forget that all the religions in the world have been advocating to respect and look after elderly parents and senior citizens. As directed by the fifth commandment of the Bible ” Honour your father and mother.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Thank You!

          Question 12.
          <br/>
          Write a speech in 150-200 words on ‘Benefits of early rising’ to be delivered by you in the morning assembly of your school. Your are Karuna/Karan, Head Girl/Head Boy. (Delhi 2016)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The benefits of early rising have been drilled into our minds from the time we are children. From a very young age our elders have condemned sleeping late and rising late as a vice. Good Morning Respected Principal Sir, Teachers and My Dear Friends, I have come before you all to speak on the benefits of early rising.
         </p>
         <p>
          The old proverb has taught us ‘Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise’. Rising early has numerous benefits, including certain scientifically proven advantages of this habit. When we rise early we get those few extra hours in which we can keep our mind and body fit. But merely rising early is not enough. One needs to leave one’s bed and go for a walk or exercise in the cool and fresh air. This soothes both the body and the mind and keeps us physically fit. Moreover the mind is most receptive in the early morning hours.
         </p>
         <p>
          There are less distractions and hence it enhances productivity in our work and study. Rising early enables us to start our days work at a time when the mind is fresh. By beginning our day early we are able to manage our work properly leading to better time management. One who rises early is able to go to bed early and has a most sound and peaceful sleep. Rising early gives us time to meditate which gives our body an energising and positive start to the day. To conclude, I would like to say fortunate are those who have formed the habit of rising early.
         </p>
         <p>
          Thank you!

          Question 13.
          <br/>
          Write a speech in 150-200 words on the topic, ‘Library plays an important role at school’. It is to be delivered in the morning assembly. You are Karuna/Karan, Head Girl/Head Boy. (Delhi 2016)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The school library is central to learning and plays a key role as a place of encouraging innovation and problem-solving. Good Morning Respected Principal Sir, Teachers and My Dear Friends. I, have come before you all to speak on the topic, ‘Library plays an important role at school.’
         </p>
         <p>
          There is no doubt libraries in schools make a difference to students’ understanding and achievement. They provide support for teaching and learning for both students and teachers. The school library makes sure that each student has equal access to academic resources, books, expensive reading material irrespective of their home opportunities or economic status. Not just students it provides teachers with full access to relevant curriculum, books, reference material, etc.
         </p>
         <p>
          The library is a model for inquiry learning and building knowledge and confidence and seeking and processing information. It is a fundamental resource for supporting students’ learning and reflects and encourages collaborative learning and sharing of ideas. Another potential quality of the school library is its potential for comprehensiveness. Moreover a school library is the best place to learn how libraries function in general and how one should make effective use of libraries. Students who are regular to their library develop questioning skills and become creative and critical thinkers. It is in the library where students become active seekers and users of information. They learn to discriminate and use valid information that is relevant to their task. The school library thus aims to give every student the opportunity to learn, to enjoy, reading and to enhance their knowledge and understanding.
         </p>

          Question 14.
          <br/>
          Write a speech in 150-200 words on the topic, ‘A student must know how to manage his time’. It is to be delivered in the morning assembly. You are Karan/Karuna, Head Boy/ Head Girl of the school. (Delhi 2016)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Time Management is the key to success and will enable us to get the most out of life. The ability to manage one’s time must be cultivated at an early age.
         </p>
         <p>
          Good Morning Respected Principal Sir, Teachers and My Dear Friends, I Karuna, the Head Girl, have come before you all to speak on the topic, ‘A student must know how to manage his time’.
         </p>
         <p>
          Once we are able to manage our time we can do more work with less stress, more organization and less desperation. There are some excellent time management techniques that we can follow. We can organise and assess our time, set our priorities, make a schedule, use a calender to plan your schedule and plan our activities logically. Although it may sometimes appear like a waste of time, we actually gain huge time savings when we take a few minutes to plan our day.
         </p>
         <p>
          When we know how to manage our time it helps us to be more productive. Moreover, if we know we have achieved the targets we had set for ourselves for the day, we can spend our free time in a relaxed manner with the utmost satisfaction. Time management helps us to take time out not just for recreation but also for other hobbies and skills we wish to indulge in. Time management will also enable us to eliminate tasks that are not important. So, I suggest we spend a little time learning time management techniques that will benefit us throughout our lives.
         </p>
         <p>
          Begin today by taking one step towards each goal. By going at your own pace you will, gradually, plan and manage your time effectively.
         </p>

          Write a speech in 150-200 words on the topic, ‘Discipline shapes the future of a student’. It is to be delivered in the morning assembly. You are Karuna/Karan. (All India 2016)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Discipline is a concept everyone is aware of, but very few actually understand it. Without discipline the world around us would be chaos. Good Morning Respected Principal Sir, Teachers and My Dear Friends, I Karuna, have come before you all to speak on the topic, ‘Discipline shapes the future of a student’. Discipline brings a sense of stability and structure into our lives. It promotes good behaviour and teaches us to be respectful. The ability of an individual to be disciplined enables him to behave in a consistently controlled manner. As the saying goes, “Talent without discipline is like an Octopus on roller skates, there is plenty of movement, but you never know if it’s going to be forward, backward or sideway.”
         </p>
         <p>
          We should be disciplined and obey our parents and teachers who are our true well-wishers and have our best interests in their minds. We must remember that we can never be achievers if we do not practice the virtue of discipline. Indiscipline lowers the level of our confidence, causes unnecessary confusion in our lives and makes us irresponsible. Students sometimes see discipline as being the opposite of freedom but in reality it is the synonym for being organized and goal-driven. Discipline is a virtue that makes an individual focussed and dedicated in all walks of life. It promotes a sound character and a well-balanced personality which are keys to succeed in any sphere.
         </p>
         <p>
          Remember, as an adult you will know you needed discipline but you cannot apply yourself to it as it is too late. As a student, you can apply yourself to it, but you think you do not need it.
         </p>
         <p>
          Thank You!

          Question 16.
          <br/>
          Write a speech in 150-200 words to be delivered in the morning assembly on the topic, ‘Water, a valuable asset, conservation at home and at school’. You are Karuna/Karan. (All India 2016)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Water, as we all know, is a valuable asset and most vital for the continuation of life on earth so there is every need to use water sensibly. Good Morning Respected Principal Sir, Teachers and My Dear Friends. I, Karuna have come before you all this morning to speak on the topic, ‘Water, a valuable asset, conservation at home and at school’.
         </p>
         <p>
          As responsible and educated inhabitants of this planet earth, it is our duty to create awareness among others to be a part of the water-conscious community. Water should be used strictly according to our need and requirement. The need to conserve water both at home and at school should be reiterated among students. To conserve water we need to reduce loss of water/avoid wasting water and improve water management practices like rainwater harvesting, recycling, etc.
         </p>
         <p>
          While learning to implement water conservation principles a few activities can prove to our advantage. These include any beneficial reduction in water loss, its use and waste of resources, avoiding any kind of damage to water quality and improving water management practices that enhance the beneficial use of water. We have to remember that we must use only that much water which we actually need, without ever wasting it. The UN has warned that water scarcity will become one of the most pressing problems on the planet in the coming decades, so it is high time we heeded this warning and learn and practice to conserve water.
         </p>
         <p>
          Question 17.
          <br/>
          Man, by destroying nature, is putting his own life at risk. Write a speech in 150-200 words on the ways in which man destroys nature and the need to create awareness of the benefits of protecting nature. (Comptt. Delhi 2016)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The value and importance of nature cannot be undermined and its conservation has been our primary concern. But unfortunately, man has been destroying nature thereby putting his own life at risk. Good morning everyone, I, have come to talk on the topic, ‘Depleting Nature, Man’s Doing’.
         </p>
         <p>
          Man’s selfishness, greed and desires are endless and uncontrolled and have led to the creation of concrete jungles. The result of this destruction of nature is an increase in barren land, soil erosion and pollution to name a few. Caring for nature and its resources and promoting their sustainable use is our essential responsibility to ensure our own survival and well being. Awareness needs to be created in schools and colleges through campaigns, assembly speeches and community rallies. NGOs need to get more active to curb all malpractices by the government and individuals. There should be a strict and firm control over industries to ensure that they adhere to rules of environmental guidelines on conservation.
         </p>
         <p>
          Nature has been given to mankind for cohabitation. The pursuit of man’s technological advancement should not destroy nature and its resources. If man wants his future generations to enjoy living on the planet earth, he must take full responsibility to protect it now.
         </p>

          Question 18.
          <br/>
          It has been the talk of the town, that behaviour of youngsters is changing due to their excessive use of mobile phones. You have been asked to speak in the morning assembly of your school on this topic. Write the speech in 150-200 words. (Comptt. All India 2016)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          It has been the talk of the town that the behaviour of youngsters is changing due to their excessive use of mobile phones. Good morning everyone, I, have come before you all to talk on this topic.
         </p>
         <p>
          The youth of today are so glued to their mobile phones that they avoid the real world and live in a world of virtual reality. They pressurize their parents to buy them the latest gadgets so that they can show off and flaunt it among their peer group. They waste precious time on their mobile phone whether it is to text messages, play games or listen to music. Youngsters now have no time to interact with their parents and family. Excessive use of mobile phones is one of the major causes of accidents, conflicts, low academic result and stressful relationships among youngsters and this needs to be tackled most seriously.
         </p>
         <p>
          Question 19.
          <br/>
          You are Radha, a well-known writer of short stories for children. You have been invited as the chief guest in a school which is celebrating its Annual Day. You decide to talk to them about the importance of storybooks. Write a speech for her in 150-200 words. (Comptt. All India 2016)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          It has been a pleasure and an honour for me to be invited as the chief guest for your Annual Day. I would like to congratulate the principal, the teachers and all the students for putting up a spectacular performance.
         </p>
         <p>
          I would also like to take this opportunity to talk to you about the importance of storybooks since I write short stories for children and always encourage children to appreciate reading. Unfortunately, most children of today lack the habit of reading storybooks. They say they do not have the time and some just do not even have the inclination to read.
         </p>
         <p>
          Let me remind you children that reading storybooks helps in character building and moral growth in your formative years. It also helps to boost creativity and intellect. Morals of many stories that we read can be connected to real life. You must understand that books have been and always will be a useful source of information and that good reading skills are important for success in our future lives.
         </p>
         <p>
          I would like to conclude by emphasizing the fact that reading will enhance your confidence level and enable you to cope with your feelings more effectively.
         </p>
         <p>
          Thank you!

          ‘Sky is not Far’ — this is not just the title of the short story collection of our esteemed teacher Ms. Geetha but it is also the motto by which she lives her life.
         </p>

          <br/>
          We are sure Ma’am that this national award is the first of many more to come in the future. Once again please accept our heartiest congratulations on a well-merited honour.

          Question 21.
          <br/>
          Sakshi Malik won a bronze medal in Rio Olympics. Every Indian felt proud of her. You, Head girl of your school want to deliver a speech in order to express your feelings. Write the speech in 150-200 words. Apart from your own ideas use the following clues: Wrestling mostly a male sport—Sakshi born in conservative surroundings — most unfavourable gender ratio for females— parental encouragement—one can’t forget the look of determination on her face in the last three minutes of the bout. (Delhi 2016)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Sakshi Malik did our country proud by winning a bronze medal in Rio Olympics, that too in wrestling, which is mostly considered a male-centric sport. It is indeed an impressive feat.
         </p>
         <p>
          Good morning Respected Principal, teachers and my dear friends. I…, have come before you all to express my feelings, which I am sure are shared by each one of you, on Sakshi Malik’s extraordinary achievement. I say extraordinary because Sakshi was born in conservative surroundings, in a small district in Haryana, a state where the gender ratio for females is most unfavourable. It is mainly due to parental encouragement that Sakshi has been able to surpass all the odds and reach her present commendable position. Can one ever forget that look of determination on her face in the last three minutes of the bout? It silently conveyed the grit and determination in her heart to be successful.
         </p>
         <p>
          I would like to conclude by saying that Sakshi Malik is an inspiration to all of us that if we have the diligence, zest and sincerity towards our goal, the sky is the limit for us.
         </p>

          Thank you!

          Question 22.
          <br/>
          Holi is a festival of colours. It expresses pure and simple joy. Sometimes we start throwing coloured water and that too on strangers. As ! the Head boy/girl of your school write a i speech in 150-200 words that you will deliver in the morning assembly of your school, describing why Holi is played and how it should be played. (All India 2016)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Holi, as we all know, is a festival of colours. It expresses pure and simple joy. But the beauty of this colourful festival lies in celebrating it in a conducive and appropriate way and not throwing coloured water or hurling water balloons on strangers.
         </p>
         <p>
          Good Morning, respected Principal, Teachers and my dear friends. I, …., have come before you all to enlighten you as to why Holi is celebrated and how it should be played. Holi celebrations start on the night before Holi with a ‘Holika Dahan’ where people gather to perform certain religious rituals before a bonfire and pray for the destruction of evil. The next day the colourful festival of Holi is celebrated wherein people smear each other with colours and water. People visit family and friends to celebrate this colourful festival with them. That is how this festival should ideally be celebrated. Forcefully applying colours and throwing water-filled balloons on strangers especially women and small children dampens the spirit of this vibrant and happy festival. We need to understand the difference between playing holi and harassing people.
         </p>
         <p>
          To conclude, I would like to remind everyone that Holi must be celebrated keeping in mind that the purpose of this festival is universal brotherhood and not to harbour hooliganism.
         </p>
         <p>
          Thank you!
         </p>

          Question 23.
          <br/>

As Principal of your school, you have decided to deliver a speech on protection from mosquitoes. Write that speech in 150-200 words. (All India 2016)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          As we all are aware after the rainy season is over, mosquitoes start breeding and they cause diseases like malaria, dengue and chikungunya, etc., These diseases can sometimes prove to be fatal.
         </p>
         <p>
          Good morning teachers and my dear students. Today I have come before you all to share with you how you can protect yourselves from these deadly mosquitoes. First and foremost it is essential to cover up. Wear light-coloured clothes that cover your legs and arms and are thick enough to prevent mosquitoes from biting. Avoid being outdoors in the morning and early evening. Efforts must be made to reduce mosquito breeding sites around your home. This can be done by eliminating stagnant water. We must make sure to empty drains or cover all things that can hold water and repair or prevent leaks. It is also important to keep rain gutters and drains clean and change water collection pans for potted plants weekly. Using an insect repellent to safeguard yourself from mosquito bites is also very effective.
         </p>
         <p>
          By following these simple steps we can not only ensure protection from mosquitoes but also keep our home and surroundings clean. Thank you!

          Question 24.
          <br/>
          You are Ram/Rajani, a nutritionist. You have been invited to speak on ‘Healthy Food’. Prepare a speech in 150-200 words pointing out how healthy food contributes to physical and mental well-being. (Comptt. Delhi 2016)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          There is enough evidence to prove that healthy food contributes to our physical and mental well-being. Good Morning everyone!… I am Ram, a nutritionist and I am here to speak on ‘Healthy food’ and its benefits and how good nutrition powers our life.
         </p>
         <p>
          Healthy food fuels all bodily processes and increases your strength, agility, coordination, immunity endurance and level of performance. It supplies the source of power for our body as well as our brain and keeps us physically and mentally fit. Eating nutritious food that contains a lot of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants nourishes both the body and the brain and protects them from oxidative stress. Unhealthy food choices lead to obesity and illness. This foods zap your energy, hinder you from socializing with your family and friends and thus leave nothing for you to look forward to. If you have difficulty in overcoming bad dietary habits, I suggest you speak to your doctor or consult a nutritionist or dietician about making better food choices based on your personal lifestyle and food preferences. Eating healthy will definitely have a positive impact on our waistline, but also remember that it will also have a good effect on our mental well-being. From reducing our risk from depression to protecting us from degenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s, a healthy and well-balanced diet truly nourishes us from inside out.
         </p>

Prepare a speech in 150-200 words, giving your views on books, how they can be our best friends and how they happen to be better than real human friends and how they can lead us to the great hobby of reading. (Comptt. Delhi)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Man is a social being and so he needs friends. It could be the company of fellowmen or animals and there are many of us who love our association with books. Good Morning everyone! I am Rajani, an academic counsellor, and I have been invited to speak on the topic, ‘Books are Our Best Friends.’
         </p>
         <p>
          I would like to start my talk with a quote by Charles William Eliot: “Books are the quietest and most constant of friends; they are the most accessible and wisest of counsellors and the most patient of teachers.” Books are our companions and they enrich our mind with good thoughts and are a storehouse of knowledge. Moreover reading inspirational books motivates us to achieve great heights and overcome our failure. Like it is with friends, it is our responsibility to choose the books we read wisely.
         </p>
         <p>
          Books are our most accessible friends whose company we can enjoy at any time and place. Befriending good books is the medicine of life as they happen to be better than real human friends and can lead us to the wonderful hobby of reading. Like good friends books enrich our personality and enable us to take up a positive approach towards life. They engage us productively and also build up our level of concentration. J.K. Rowling very rightly said, ” I do believe something very magical can happen when you read a good book.”
         </p>
         <p>
          To conclude, I would like to say books enlighten us and those of you who develop the habit of reading will find yourself more knowledgable and well-informed. So make sure you enjoy the company of these selfless friends.
         </p>
         <p>
          Thank you!

          Question 26.
          <br/>
          You are Ram/Rajani, an academic counsellor. You have been invited to speak on ‘Reading Makes a Ready Man’. Prepare a speech in 150¬200 words, giving your views on reading and pointing out how reading improves our knowledge, promotes thinking and develops our emotional health, thereby promoting peace and prosperity in life. (Comptt. Delhi 2016)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          I would like to start my talk with a quote by the famous philosopher and author, Sir Francis Bacon ‘Reading Maketh a full Man..’ because reading not only improves our knowledge and promotes thinking but it also develops our emotional health, thereby promoting peace and prosperity in life.
         </p>
         <p>
          Good Morning everyone!, I, Rajani am an academic counsellor and I have been invited to speak on ‘Reading Makes a Ready Man’. Reading is the best form of self-education and there is no limit to how much one can learn from sensible reading. Besides being an excellent way of passing our time, reading gives us a welcome break from our sometimes mundane and repetitive lives. Choose from a wide variety of written material to suit your personal preference and you will see it is a great way to feed your mind and spirit.
         </p>
         <p>
          The human mind is a continuous processing machine, that is always seeking information, and reading is the most apt way to nourish and stimulate our mind and keep it engaged constructively, which in turn will keep it away from negative thinking. Reading also helps to keep our mental faculties sharp and intact and it gives the mind a mental workout that does not let our mind become stale and dormant. As Mark Twain said: ‘The man who does not read has no advantage over the man who cannot read’. Reading is a form of relaxation that also develops our emotional well-being by enabling us to explore and delve into new avenues. Although the benefits of reading are numerous and priceless it is important that we read only that which does not damage our mind and keeps us away from negativity. I would like to conclude with a quote by Rachel Ander. ‘The journey of a lifetime starts with the turning of a page’.
         </p>
         <p>
          Thank you!

          <br/>
          You are RanVRajani. Write a speech in 150-200 words on ‘Importance of Morning Walk’. (Comptt. All India 2016)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The only thing one may at times not like about a morning walk is the fact that one has to get up early in the morning from a sound sleep. Other than that, the importance and advantages of morning walk are manifold. Good Morning everyone! I, Rajani, have come before you all to speak on the topic, ‘Importance of Morning Walk’.
         </p>
         <p>
          The morning atmosphere is fresh and pleasant, there is less pollution in the air and the lovely sights and sounds of nature soothes one’s mind and body. Regular morning walk keeps one fit. It helps control blood pressure, lessens stress and gives us the energy to work with zeal. It is a light exercise that is suitable for people of all ages. Young men and women, old people as well as children, all can benefit from a morning walk which soothes our entire being.
         </p>
         <p>
          A brisk walk in the morning activates our body’s systems, normalizes our pulse rate and improves our blood circulation. When we begin our day with a walk, we rid ourselves from lethargy and experience a high level of energy that has a positive effect on our physical and mental well-being. Morning walk actually creates a positive momentum that stays with us throughout the day. The best thing about a morning walk is that it is a simple workout regime that most people think they can stick to life long.
         </p>
         <p>
          To conclude, I would like to say that since we all share the need to stay healthy, walking is a great way to spend quality time in the company of family and friends doing something that is beneficial to everyone.
         </p>
         <p>
          Question 28.
          <br/>
          You are Ram/Rajani, President of Humour Club in Chennai. Prepare a speech in 150-200 words on ‘Laughter, the best medicine’ to address students in a school forum. Include the importance of laughing and smiling, the need to bring in harmless humour in life and the important role it plays in relieving stress, using interesting anecdotes. (Comptt. All India 2016)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The proverb, ‘Laughter is the best medicine’, is as old as it is true. It is important to laugh and smile and bring in harmless humour in our daily life as it plays an important role in relieving stress. Good Morning all! I Rajani, President of Humour Club in Chennai, have come to address you on ‘Laughter, the Best Medicine’.
         </p>
         <p>
          When we laugh, a positivity brightens us and we are able to spread this positive feeling to others. Just by having a good laugh we can relax both our body and our mind. Even in the most difficult of times a laugh or even a smile can make you feel better as it disintegrates feelings that make one upset. It helps one to unwind and energize himself. You can get rid of the tensions and stress that clutter your mind with a good laugh that infuses fresh energy and enthusiasm.
         </p>
         <p>
          As Charles Dickens said, “There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humour.” But unfortunately, in today’s busy and hectic life people have forgotten how to laugh and enjoy small jokes. This could be one of the major reasons why there is an unprecedented rise in the number of people who suffer from depression. Charlie Chaplin very rightly said, “A day without laughter is a day wasted”.
         </p>
         <p>
          I would like to conclude by saying, “You don’t stop laughing because you grow older, you grow older because you stop laughing.”
         </p>
         <p>
