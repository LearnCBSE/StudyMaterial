           <br/>
           Cricket is not played in communist countries like China and Russia so it has less viewership there. India is one of the oldest cricket playing nation which further adds to its large viewership in the country.

           How is Test cricket a unique game in many ways?

            </strong>
           </span>
           <br/>
           Test cricket is unique because it can go on for five days and still can end with a draw. No other game requires even half of this time to finish. A football match is played for 90 minutes.
           <br/>
           Even nine innings of a baseball match gets over less than what it takes to finish a one-day match.

           How is cricket different from other team games?
           <br/>
           <span style="color: #008000;">
            <strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
           </span>
           <br/>
           Cricket is different from other team games because in cricket, the length of the pitch is mentioned as 22 yards however, the shape of the ground could be oval or circular. There is no specific measurement for the size of the ground as well.
           <br/>
           It is the only game played for five days and can end without a specific result. Unlike cricket, many other popular games like hockey or football follows certain specification for grounds

           A cricket match was organised in Muzaffarnagar last week. I went to watch the match alongwith my friend. I live in Modinagar and Muzaffarnagar is two hours bus journey from my place. We caught a bus of Uttar Pradesh transportation from the bus depot near my place. It was an old and crowded bus. We didn’t get any seat and had to keep standing all through the journey. The passengers were mostly farmers from the nearby villages.
           <br/>
           They were very simple and friendly. We were chatting with each other and cracking jokes. It was a long journey and the roads were very bad.
           <br/>
           When we finally reached Muzaffarnagar, I felt relaxed. There was a large fair being organised at the place where the match was to be played. There was still time left for the match to begin so we decided to enjoy the fare. There were many stalls of food items and games at the fare and we had great fun.
           <br/>
           The match started on its time. It was between two village teams. We were cheering for our team. There was a tough competition between both the teams and finally our village won the game.
           <br/>
           The match was very exciting and enjoyable, but the long journey had made us tired. It was a very good day that left behind many sweet memories.

            </strong>
           </span>
           Initially the cricket bat was similar to the shape of hockey bat because the ball was bowled underarm. The bowlers then began to pitch the ball through the air rather than rolling it on ground. The curved bats were then replaced by the straight ones. Initially the bat was made by a single piece of wood. These days it consists of two pieces. The blade is made of willow wood while the handle is of cane.

           Following the above mentioned trend, one immediate change was the replacement of the curved bats by the straight ones. The bowlers got the options of length, deception through air and increased pace because of this. It opened new possibilities for spin and swing bowling. In response
           <br/>
           to tricks applied by the bowlers, the batsmen had to improve their timings and shot selection.
