           When I was a child, which is almost more than fifty years ago, the environment was very pristine, very beautiful, and very green. We were a British colony, and the British government at that time started to clear cut the indigenous forests in our forested mountains because they wanted to establish commercial plantations of exotic species of trees such as the pines from the northern hemisphere and the eucalyptus from Australia. These trees are very nice, they grow tall, and they grow very fast, but as they grow they destroy all the local biological diversity. All the flora and fauna disappeared. So although we were getting commercial timber for the growing timber industry, we also destroyed our local flora and fauna.(Environment)

           </strong>
           Right from Nick’s childhood, his parents did their best to make him independent. Nick’s father put him in the water at 18 months and gave him the courage to learn swimming. He encouraged Nick to get into football and skating. He taught him how to type with his toe at just six years old. Nick’s mother invented a special plastic device that meant Nick could hold a pen and pencil. Despite the risk of being bullied, Nick’s parents joined him mainstream school. These efforts helped Nick become independent.

           The author was reluctant to carry his own luggage as he had the feeling that if he carried the luggage, the whole world would laugh at him. He thought that his edu­cation had made him shun physical labour. If I were in the author’s place, I would not do what he did. 1 would myself carry the luggage without looking for others’ help.
