           (a) due to peddling, the point of contact of real wheel has a tendency to move backwards. So frictional force opposes the back ward tendency i,e., frictional force acts in the forward direction. But the back wheel accelerates the front wheel in the forward direction. To oppose this frictional force acts in the back ward direction on front wheel.

           (b) Statement-1 relates to visual experience. Statement -2 is also correct. It is just the method the relative velocity of an object w.r.t another is calculated. But it does not explains Statement-1. The correct explanation of Statement-1 is passed on the visual perception of motion, particularly the angular velocity. The object appears to be moving faster when its angular velocity is greater.

           (b) Statement-1 is practical experience of everyday life, it is true.Statement-2 is also true but is not the correct explanation of Statement -1.

           .(a) Refer the figure. When the block moves down the inclined plane, the force of friciton f acts upwards along the plane. Let Fj be the force needed to make the block move without any acceleration. As the acceleration is zero, no net force acts on the block as its slides down the plane. Hence

           <strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           False:A rocket is propelled not by pushing the surrounding air backwards but by the ejection of a portion of its mass to the back. The forward force on the rocket is the reaction to the backward force on the ejected material and as more material is ejected, the mass of the rocket decreases.

           False:When a person walks on a rough surface, he pushes the foot backward . The motion of the surface of contact is backward. Therefore the frictional force will act in the forward direction which is the direction of motion of the person, the statement is false.
