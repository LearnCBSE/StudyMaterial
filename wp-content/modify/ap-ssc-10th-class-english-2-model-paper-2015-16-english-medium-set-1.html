           Once, the emperor Srikrishna Deva Rayalu was in serious discussions with his army chief and ministers, regarding attacking the enemy kingdoms, which posed them a threat. A little later, Tenali Rama reached the emperor’s chamber and saw that he was busy. Inspite of moving out of there, Tenali Rama, as usual started his tricks to attract the attention of the emperor.
           <br/>
           Furious with his ridiculous behaviour, “You shall be punished for this Tenali Rama,’’ said the emperor and summoned the guards. “Take Tenali Rama to the outskirts of the city, bury him neck deep in a pit and have an elephant crush his head,” ordered the angry emperor.
           <br/>
           The guards took him to a lonely place outside the city near the river bank, dug a pit and buried him deep in the ground. Then they left the place to come back with an elephant. Soon after they left, a hunch backed washerman came there and saw Tenali Rama. Though scared of the sight initially, he found the whole thing and walked up to Tenali Rama. On seeing him, Tenali Rama thought of a plan and played his trick on the washerman and escaped from the pit.
           <br/>

One day everyone in the village was going to rich man’s house for dinner on the other side of the forest. Balu and Appu wanted to go for the dinner.

           Then the tiger roared. Balu at once knew a tiger was near. He lay down quietly. The tiger came to him and smelt his body. The tiger ’s whiskers touched Balu’s nose. At once, Balu sneezed. Ah Choooo !’ The tiger was frightened and ran away.

           </strong>
           <br/>
           The tiger is the largest member of the cat family. People admire the tiger for its strength and beauty, but they fear it because it has been known to kill and eat people. Yet almost all tigers avoid people. It has been noticed that tigers which attack human beings are those, which are sick or wounded and therefore cannot hunt large ani­mals.
           <br/>
           Wild tigers are found mainly in Asia. They live in a wide range of climates and are found in the hot rain forests, dry thorn woods, tall grass-lands, swamps and marshes. Tigers prefer to live in the shadows and seldom go into open country as lions do.
           <br/>
           Tigers usually hunt at night, wandering over animal’s trails and long stream beds. The tiger depends on its sharp eyes and keen ears, but it may also use its sense of smell. It is an extremely swift animal, rushing to its prey in a series of bounds. Using its sharp claws, the tiger grasps its victim by the rump side and pulls to the ground.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Now answer the following questions.

           .Tenali Rama was thinking of how to escape from the punishment. Suddenly, he saw a washerman with a hunchback returning from the river bank with some clothes. The washerman looked at Tenali Rama and thought he must be a saint. He walked up to Tenali Rama and said, “O great learned one, I would like to be blessed by you.”
           <br/>
           Seeing him Tenali Rama got an idea. “I am not a saint, but an ordinary washer man like you. I used to carry heavy loads of clothes like you and developed a crooked back. A saint told me to dig a pit and buiy myself till my neck and stay for an hour,” replied Tenali Rama. “The remedy seems to have worked, I can-feel my back straighten up,” Tenali Rama continued. The innocent washerman was fooled. “Can I also try this remedy ?” asked the washerman eagerly. Of course, said Tenali Rama, “but, first you will have to get me out.” The washerman quickly dug Tenali Rama out of the pit. On seeing Tenalirama’s straight back his hopes grew. Tenali Rama buried him till his neck. “Remember, you have to stay inside the pit for one hour,” said Tenali Rama. He walked away from that place and escaped the punishment.

           In this letter I want to write about the Children’s Day function in our school. Today we celebrated Children’s Day in a very happy and active mood. Our teachers and students of class IX presented various activities and events in a very interesting manner. This year children participated in a handful of activities such as drawing, colouring, making birthday cards, etc. They all received wonderful prizes for their performances by the Sarpanch and the Chairman of SMC, I received a prize for painting the portrait of Jawaharlal Nehru. The children put on their best colourful dresses. They were treated with sweets. I also gave a small speech on Jawaharlal Nehru during the programme. Our English teacher gave me an expensive pen as a gift appreciating my speech.

           <br/>
           Balu and Appu were very good friends. Balu could not see, he was blind. Appu could not walk, he was lame. They lived in a village near a forest. One day everyone in the village was going to rich man’s house for dinner on the other side of the forest. Balu and Appu wanted to go for the dinner.
           <br/>
           Blind Balu thought of a plan. He would carry Appu. The lame man could tell him the way. Appu said that the plan was good one.                                                               .
           <br/>
           On the way through the forest, Appu saw a tiger. He did not tell Balu about it. Instead, he quietly asked Balu to carry him to the nearest tree. Upon reaching a branch, Appu quickly pulled himself up.
           <br/>
           Then the tiger roared. Balu at once knew a tiger was near. He lay down quietly. The tiger came to him and smelt his body. The tiger ’s whiskers touched Balu’s nose. At once, Balu sneezed. Ah Choooo !’ The tiger was frightened and ran away.
           <br/>
           Then Appu came down from the tree. He asked Balu what the tiger had said to him. Balu said that the tiger told him to choose his friends wisely.

            16.Read the following passage carefully.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The tiger is the largest member of the cat family. People admire the tiger for its strength and beauty, but they fear it because it has been known to kill and eat people. Yet almost all tigers avoid people. It has been noticed that tigers which attack human beings are those, which are sick or wounded and therefore cannot hunt large ani­mals.
           <br/>
           Wild tigers are found mainly in Asia. They live in a wide range of climates and are found in the hot rain forests, dry thorn woods, tall grass-lands, swamps and marshes. Tigers prefer to live in the shadows and seldom go into open country as lions do.
           <br/>
           Tigers usually hunt at night, wandering over animal’s trails and long stream beds. The tiger depends on its sharp eyes and keen ears, but it may also use its sense of smell. It is an extremely swift animal, rushing to its prey in a series of bounds. Using its sharp claws, the tiger grasps its victim by the rump side and pulls to the ground.
           <br/>
