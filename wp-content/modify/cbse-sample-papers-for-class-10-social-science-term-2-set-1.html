           How did the Non-Cooperation Movement unfold in the cities and towns of India? (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The movement started with middle-class participation in the cities.
           </li>

           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Related Theory:
           <br/>
           The Non-Cooperation movement unfolded in stages where people refused to cooperate with the British government without breaking any civil laws. For example, people stopped attending British established institutions like schools, colleges, offices, courts and initiated setting up alternative Indian institutions.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           The Civil disobedience movement involved people breaking the existing civil laws.

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Why is tourism considered as a trade? (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Foreign tourist’s arrival in the country contributing to foreign exchange.
           </li>
           <li>
            Many people are directly engaged in the tourism industry.
           </li>
           <li>
            Tourism provides support to local handicrafts.
           </li>
           <li>
            Tourists visit India for medical tourism, eco-tourism, adventure tourism, cultural tourism and business tourism
           </li>
           <li>
            Any other relevant point. (Any two points)
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Explanation:
           <br/>
           Tourism is considered as a trade because it adds to the strength of our economy by bringing in foreign currency. It also boosts the production of local goods and handicrafts which in turn provides employment to owners and workers of indigenous handicraft industries in India. Tourism also leads to development of infrastructure in India.

           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Differentiate between one party and two party system. (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (A) One Party System:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Countries, where only one party is allowed to control and run the government, are called one party system.
           </li>
           <li>
            Eg. In China only Communist Party is allowed to rule.
           </li>
           <li>
            Any other relevant point
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (B) Two Party System:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Countries where only two main parties contest elections are called Two Party System.
           </li>
           <li>
            The United States of America and United Kingdom are examples of Two Party System.
           </li>
           <li>
            Any other relevant point
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Related Theory:
           <br/>
           Multiple parties are allowed to exist even in the Two party or Bi-party system but power and authority only rotates between the two central and more powerful parties as mentioned in the answer.
          </p>
          <p>
           Caution
           <br/>
           For questions, where differentiating characteristics are asked, it is important for the students to carefully pick up points which explain the stark contrast between the two categories as asked in the question. For example, here, another feature of differentiation could have been that one party systems generally result in autocracies while two party systems might not necessarily result in autocracies. Flowever, this point doesn’t underline the difference as evidently as the mentioned points.
          </p>

           Question 4.
           <br/>
           State the role of Reserve Bank of India. (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <ul>
           <li>
            In India, the Reserve Bank of India issues currency notes on behalf of the Central Government.
           </li>
           <li>
            The RBI supervises the functioning of formal sources of loans.
           </li>
           <li>
            The RBI monitors the banks in actually maintaining cash balance.
           </li>
           <li>
            The RBI sees that the banks give loans not just to profit-making businesses and traders but also to small cultivators.
           </li>
           <li>
            Any other relevant point. (Any two points)
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Explanation:
           <br/>
           The Reserve Bank of India is the sole regulator and issuer of Indian currency. It issues the notes of ₹ 2, 5,10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 2000 for circulation among the public. It is the Bank of the Banks and monitors their lending activities.
          </p>
          <p>
           Related Theory:
           <br/>
           The Reserve Bank of India is also the Banker of the government and a lender of last resort for atl the government, state governments and other financial institutions.
          </p>

           (A) Compare the 2015-2016 and 2019-2020 data and give any one reason for the reduction of production of steel in 2019-2020. (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            High costs
           </li>
           <li>
            Limited availability of coking coal
           </li>
           <li>
            Lower productivity of labour
           </li>
           <li>
            IrreguLar supply of energy
           </li>
           <li>
            Any other relevant point (Any one point)
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Related Theory:
           <br/>
           Steel is needed to manufacture a variety of engineering goods, construction material, defence, medical, telephonic, scientific equipment and a variety of consumer goods.
          </p>
          <p>
           India is an important iron and steel producing country in the world but we are not able to perform to our full potential because:
           <br/>
           (a) High costs and limited availability of coking coal which is one of the raw materials.
           <br/>
           (b) Lower productivity of labour involved in this industry
          </p>
          <p>
           Caution:
           <br/>
           Students must not get distracted due to the given table and focus upon the keywords in the question. It is important for students to understand that the reason for reduction in production of steel would remain the same regardless of the years.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Gandhiji adopted nonviolence as a philosophy and an ideal way of life. According to him philosophy of nonviolence is not a weapon of the weak; it is a weapon, which can be tried by all.

           <br/>
           Ever since humans appeared on the earth, they have used different means of communication. But, the pace of change, has been rapid in modern times. Long distance communication is far easier without physical movement of the communicator or receiver. Personal communication and mass communication including television, radio, press, films, etc. are the major means of communication in the country. The Indian postal network is the largest in the world. It handles parcels as well as personal written communications. Cards and envelopes are considered first-class mail and are airlifted between stations covering both land and air. The second-class mail includes book packets, registered newspapers and periodicals. They are carried by surface mail, covering land and water transport. To facilitate quick delivery of mails in large towns and cities, six mail channels have been introduced recently. They are called Rajdhani Channel, Metro Channel, Green Channel, Business Channel, Bulk Mail Channel and Periodical Channel.
