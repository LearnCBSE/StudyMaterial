           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Neem Baba speaks to Amber as if he is a person. This type of speech is called personification. Let us look at some more examples.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The leaves whispered in the wind.
           </li>
           <li>
            The flowers danced merrily in the breeze.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Now, discuss it with your classmates and teacher.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Personification is a literary device where human characteristics are attributed to non-human entities. It helps create vivid imagery and emotional connections in writing. Letâ€™s look at the examples provided:
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            The leaves whispered in the wind.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Here, the leaves are given the human action of whispering, which creates an image of gentle movement and a soft, rustling sound as the wind passes through them.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            The flowers danced merrily in the breeze.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           In this example, the flowers are described as dancing, which conveys the idea of them swaying joyfully with the gentle breeze, adding a sense of liveliness and cheerfulness to the scene.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Discussion:
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Personification can make descriptions more engaging and relatable by giving life to inanimate objects or abstract concepts. It allows readers to visualize scenes more vividly and feel a stronger emotional connection to the elements of the story. When Neem Baba speaks to Amber as if he is a person, it not only makes the interaction more engaging but also imbues the neem tree with wisdom and personality, making the information shared more memorable and impactful. Personification is a powerful tool in storytelling and poetry, helping to create rich, imaginative experiences for readers.

           Peepal Baba
           <br/>
           Rahul: Maa, have you heard about Peepal Baba? Our teacher told us about him today.
           <br/>
           Mother: I have not heard about him. Who is he and what does he do?
           <br/>
           Rahul: He plants trees along with his team. He also started a movement to plant and save trees.
           <br/>
           Mother: Thatâ€™s wonderful. Where did he get this idea from?
           <br/>
           Rahul: When he was studying in a school in Pune, his English teacher gave him the idea to plant trees. He was just 11 years old.
           <br/>
           Mother: How did he plant so many trees all over the country as a child?
           <br/>
           Rahul: He was born to an army officerâ€™s family in Chandigarh and whenever they were moved to a new city, he planted more trees.
           <br/>
           Mother: But how did he come to be known as Peepal Baba?
           <br/>
           Rahul: He used to plant Peepal and Neem trees as they have many uses for us and told others to do so. So, in the beginning, people made fun of him by calling him Peepal Baba but he was not bothered and continued to do his work. Now everyone calls him by that name lovingly.
           <br/>
           Mother: He is doing great work. We should learn from him and plant more trees.
           <br/>
           Rahul: Yes, Maa. We must tell others to do the same.

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Now, speak about the whole process of making the card in front of the class.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Hello Everyone,
           <br/>
           Today, Iâ€™m going to share with you the process of making a beautiful and informative card about a tree or plant leaf. I chose the neem tree for my example. Hereâ€™s how I did it:
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Step 1: Collecting the Leaf
           </strong>
           <br/>
           First, I collected a dry leaf from the neem tree. Itâ€™s important to ensure the leaf is clean and dry before using it for our project.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Step 2: Drawing the Leaf
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Next, I took a blank card and drew the shape of the neem leaf on the front. I paid close attention to its details, like the serrated edges and the veins. After outlining, I colored it to make it look as realistic as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Step 3: Writing the Information
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Inside the card, I wrote some important information about the neem tree. I included:
           <br/>
           Name of the tree/plant: Neem
           <br/>
           One of its uses: Neem leaves have antibacterial properties and are used in traditional medicine to treat skin infections.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Step 4: Final Touches
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Finally, I reviewed the card to make sure everything was neat and legible. I added any additional details to enhance the presentation.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Conclusion
           </strong>
           <br/>
           This project not only helped me learn more about the neem tree but also gave me the chance to practice my drawing and writing skills. Itâ€™s a fun and educational activity that I recommend to all of you. Thank you for listening!
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Ask your classmates to identify the leaf and tell them one of its uses. After they answer, open the card, and share what you have written.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           It is a classroom activity, so do it in your class under your teacherâ€™s guidance.

           You have read about Neem Baba and learned many things about the Neem tree. Look at the trees in your neighborhood and write a paragraph about any one tree that you like.

            Where it is (roadside/park, etc.)
           </li>
           <li>
            How it looks (height, tree trunk, leaves, flowers, etc.)
           </li>
           <li>
            Why do you like it (shade, medicinal properties, shelter, beauty, etc.)
           </li>
           <li>

           <br/>
           <strong>
            The Majestic Banyan Tree
           </strong>
           <br/>
           In the bustling park near my home, there stands a majestic banyan tree. It is a colossal presence with its towering height and expansive canopy. The tree trunk is thick and gnarled, with roots that cascade down from the branches, creating a natural curtain. The leaves are broad and glossy, providing a dense cover that offers cool shade on hot days. During certain seasons, the tree blooms with small, red flowers that attract birds and insects, adding to its vibrant beauty.
          </p>
          <p>
           I particularly like the banyan tree for its shade and the sense of tranquility it brings to the park. On many afternoons, I find solace sitting beneath its vast canopy, reading a book, or simply enjoying the peace. The tree also serves as a natural playground for children, who swing from its aerial roots and play hide-and-seek around its massive trunk. Its presence in the park is not just a source of beauty but also a testament to natureâ€™s resilience and grandeur. The banyan tree is a symbol of shelter and comfort, offering a haven for both people and wildlife. Its timeless beauty and serene presence make it my favorite tree in the neighborhood.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
           When people from Persia came to India and saw that a common tree of their country was freely growing here, they started calling the tree Azad Darakhte Hindi. So, the scientific name of Neem in Latin became Azadirachta indica.
           <br/>
           Neem has different names in the Indian languages. Discuss with your teacher and find out which Indian languages these names belong to.
