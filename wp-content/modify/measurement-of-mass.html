           Weight of a body is defined as the force with which the body is attracted by the earth towards its centre. It is represented by the symbol W.
           <br/>
           A body of mass m has weight W and is given by the relation, W = mg, where g is acceleration due to gravity. The S.I. unit of weight is newton. Weight is a vector quantity. Its direction is towards the centre of earth and along its radius.

           Besides the difference in their definitions, the two quantities have following two differences :

           1. Mass m is constant at all places. Weight W = m’g varies from place to place because g varies on earth surface.

           2. Mass m is never zero. Weight W = mg becomes zero at the centre of the earth, g = 0, free fall state and in a satellite where a – g Apparent weight R = m(g – a)
           <br/>
           =&gt; R = m(g -g) =&gt; R = 0. It is called weightlessness.

            Definition.
           </strong>
           The mass which offers inertia, is called inertial mass. It is represented by the symbol m
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>

           <strong>
            Discussion.
           </strong>
           From the study of Newton’s first law of motion, we know that inertia is a natural property of all the bodies. Because of inertia, effort (force) is needed to move a body from rest or to bring a body to rest from motion. Bodies with more mass need bigger efforts for bringing similar changes in their states of rest or of motion. It means that the mass of a body is a measure of quantity of inertia in it. Such a mass which gives measure of inertia, is the inertial mass. For this reason, this mass is also defined as the ‘inertial-coefficient’ of the body,
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Measurement.
           </strong>
           From Newton’s second law of motion, F = m

           </sub>

           <sub>

           </sub>
           – F/a. This relation can be used for measuring the inertial mass of a body by applying a known force on the body and measuring the acceleration produced in it. But this direct measurement is difficult because it needs friction and other forces to be zero for motion and accurate measurement of acceleration.

            Gravitational Mass
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (i) Definition.
           </strong>
           The mass which offers gravitational attraction, is called gravitational mass.It is represented by the symbol m
           <sub>
            G
           </sub>
           .
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (ii) Discussion.
           </strong>
           Due to gravity (a special case of gravitation) earth attracts every body towards its centre. This attraction makes the body fall towards the centre of the earth. Hence ( force of gravity is more on bodies with more mass. It means that the mass of a body is a measure of force of gravity (weight) acting on the body. Such a mass which gives measure of weight, is the gravitational mass. For this reason, this mass (gravitational mass) is also called weight of the body (and the process of its determination is called ‘weighing’ not ‘massing).
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (iii) Measurement.
           </strong>
           From the weight-mass relation, W = m
           <sub>
            G
           </sub>
           g, i.e., m
           <sub>
            G
           </sub>
           = W/g. This relation can be used for measuring the gravitational mass of a body by measuring its weight at a place where value of acceleration due to gravity is known.

           The ratio can be found by using very accurate types of pendulums.
           <br/>
           Observations carried over a period of about two decades have shown that the ratio is one with variation of only 1 part in 5 x 10

A light bar is attached to the lower end of the spring which carries a hook at its lower end. The body whose gravitational mass is to be determined is suspended from this hook. The spring is enclosed in a metallic case on which a graduated brass plate is fixed. The graduations are either in gram or in kilogram. The pointer projects out of a long narrow rectangular slit in the front plate. It moves down along the graduated scale when the spring is stretched by suspending a body from the lower hook.
           <br/>
           Zero error and zero correction. The value of one smallest division on scale is found to know the least count of the balance. The hook is pulled down a little and then left. If the pointer returns back to zero of scale, there is no zero error. If the pointer stays below zero, the zero error is positive. It is equal to the reading of the position of the pointer. If the pointer goes above zero mark, zero error is negative. To know this negative zero error, a body of known mass is suspended from the hook. The pointer moves down to indicate its mass which is less than the actual mass. The difference in mass gives value of the negative zero error.
           <br/>
           Sign of zero error is changed to convert it into zero correction. The zero correction is then algebraically added to observed values of masses to know correct masses.

            Working.
           </strong>
           The body whose gravitational mass is to be determined, is suspended from the hook of the balance. The body stretches the spring due to its weight and the pointer moves down. The weight is proportional to the gravitational mass (weight W = m
           <sub>
            G
           </sub>
           g). The position of the pointer gives value of the gravitational mass of the body.

            Changes in calibration.
           </strong>
           Since W – m

           g, for same gravitational mass m

            G
           </sub>
           , weight W will change from place to place due to changes in value of g. It means that scale calibrated at one place will not be accurate at other places.
           <br/>
           Hence we say that spring balance measures weight of a body which has different values at different places.
           <br/>

           <br/>
           At all places, the ratio of gravitational masses of two bodies will be same as ratio of their weights. Hence by comparing an unknown gravitational mass with a known gravitational mass by a spring balance, the unknown gravitational mass can be determined.

            Introduction.
           </strong>
           It is a device used for the determination of gravitational mass of a body. It works on the fact that at one place, bodies having equal weights have equal gravitational masses.
           <br/>
           It also makes use of principle of moments. According to the principle, bodies of equal weights when suspended from a beam at equal distance, on the two sides of its fulcrum, keep the beam horizontal. It is essentially a lever of the first order having the power arm and weight arm equal.
           <br/>

           <br/>
           <strong>
            Construction.
           </strong>
           Its main parts are :
           <br/>
           1. The central pillar. A metallic hollow pillar W is fixed upright (vertical) in the middle of a rectangular wooden base board. The board has two levelling screws at the front corner and small vertical pillar at the middle of the back side. There is a plumb line R, suspended along the sides of the pillar, which has its lower tip pointing to a metal cone. With its help, the vertical setting of the pillar is tested.
           <br/>
           2. The beam. It is a rigid bar B, often of girder construction, made of nickel plated iron or brass or aluminium. It has a central knife edge or fulcrum of steel or agate (a kind of hard stone) turned downwards. This rests on a flat agate surface fixed to the top of a vertical support within the central pillar. At both the ends of the beam are sharp knife edges of agate or steel which are turned upwards. The ends are also provided with two small adjustable screws n

            1

           and n

           </sub>
           .
           <br/>
           3. Scale pans. Two exactly similar pans P
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           and P

           of equal weights and size are suspended by means of hooks S

           and S

            2
           </sub>
           from agate planes supported on knife edges at the ends of the beam.
           <br/>
           4. Arresting arrangement. When not in use, the beam of the balance is kept arrested by means of an arrangement known as arresting arrangement. In this arrangement, the beam rests on two pillars, S, S, projecting from and fixed to the top end of the pillar W. By means of a handle L, the vertical support of the beam may be raised.
           <br/>
           5. The pointer and scale. A light pointer P is attached in the middle of the beam with pointed end vertical downwards. There is also small graduated scale G fixed at the foot of the pillar. When the beam is free, the pointed end moves to and fro over the scale. When the balance is adjusted, the pointer rests on the central mark of the scale generally marked ‘zero’. The pointer carries a small sliding nut (not shown in the figure) used to lower or raise the centre of gravity of the beam and the pointer.
           <br/>
           The balance is enclosed in a glass case so that the air currents should not disturb the weighings. The front glass door can be raised or shut easily by a side attachment.
           <br/>
           (Before starting to use the balance, the students should carefully understand the function of each part of it).

           <br/>
           Definition. Resting point (R.P.) of a balance is defined as the point on the scale, at which the pointer will stay at rest when the beam is in raised position. In final adjustment the resting point should always be within one division on either side of the middle mark on the scale.
           <br/>

           <br/>
           Determination. In a sensitive balance, the pointer generally takes a long time to come to rest and hence the R.P. is determined by observations made during its motion (method of oscillations).
           <br/>
           When beam is free, the pointer will swing across the scale, resting point will be that point about which the pointer swings equally on both sides. For greater accuracy, turning points of the pointer are noted on the scale. Three consecutive observations are taken, first on the left (L

            Introduction.
           </strong>
           Like a physical balance, a metre scale can be used as a beam balance making use of the same principle of moments.
           <br/>
           Besides it has adjustable power arm and weight arm whose length can be adjusted.

           <strong>
            Construction (Arrangement).
           </strong>
           The metre scale is balanced by putting its 50 cm mark over the sharp edge of a heavy broad wedge which works as fulcrum. In this position the weight of the metre scale and reaction of the wedge, balance each other.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Working.
           </strong>
           The body is tied to a strong and light thread loop and suspended on the left of the wedge on some fixed mark. (Say 20 cm in diagram)
           <br/>
           A light paper pan is suspended by a strong and light thread on the right. Weights are put on the pan. The position of the loop of the pan and weight in it are so adjusted that the metre scale becomes horizontal again.
           <br/>
           Position of thread of the loops and the amount of weights in the pan are noted.
           <br/>
           Mass of the body is calculated using the following theory.
           <br/>

           <br/>
           Two different methods
           <br/>
           (i)Arm lengths fixed, and equal, weight adjustable.
           <br/>
           The thread loops are suspended at position forming both arm of equal length. Weights in the paper pan are adjusted till the metre scale becomes horizontal. (Fig. 3.07).

           <br/>
           (ii) Masses and power arm fixed, weight arm adjustable.
           <br/>
           .Mass is suspended at a fixed distance a1.
           <br/>
           Length of power arm is adjusted by moving weight loop thread in and out till the metre scale becomes horizontal (Fig. 3.08). ,

           </span>
           <br/>
           It is a wooden box containing a set of weights along with a forceps used with a physical balance. They are all arranged in circular grooves made in order of increasing weights (Fig. 3.09).
           <br/>
           <img alt="measurement-of-mass-14" height="330" loading="lazy" src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5759/30352888484_6130058369_o.png" width="440"/>
           <br/>
           The weights with 1 g to 100 g are cylindrical in shape and are provided with a small spherical knob at the top to help in lifting them with forceps. The number engraved on each weight gives value of its weight in grams. In addition to these weights, there are fractional weights of different shapes made of aluminium and marked in milligrams. Weight of 500,50 and 5 mg are pentagonal, 200, 20 and 2 mg are rectangular and 100, 10 and 1 mg are triangular in shape.

             Principle of weighting
            </strong>
           </span>
           <br/>
           A physical balance determines gravitational mass of a body making use of principle of moments. It has both arms of beam of equal length and mass. The two pans also have equal weights. Hence the beam, when made free, remains horizontal with empty pans.
           <br/>
           A body having gravitational mass m
           <sub>
            G1
           </sub>
           is placed in the left pan and a standard weight of gravitational mass m
           <sub>
            G2
           </sub>
           is put in the right pan to keep the beam horizontal. Then,
           <br/>
           Weight (m
           <sub>
            G1
           </sub>
           g) in left pan = weight (m
           <sub>
            G2
           </sub>
           g) in right pan
           <br/>
           or m
           <sub>
            G1

           = m
           <sub>
            G2
           </sub>
           <br/>
           i. e., gravitational mass of the body in left pan = gravitational mass of the standard weights in right pan.
           <br/>
           Hence a physical balance determines gravitational mass of a body by equating it with gravitational mass of standard weight.
