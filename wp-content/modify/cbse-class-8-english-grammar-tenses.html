           1. Read the following sentences carefully :
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Birds fly in the air.
           </li>
           <li>
            My brother flew to England last week.
           </li>
           <li>
            I shall fly a kite on Sunday. –
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           In the first sentence the Verb ‘fly’ refers to the Present time, in the second sentence the Verb ‘flew’ refers to the action in the Past, while the Verb in the third sentence ‘shall fly’ refers to the Future.

           2. The Tense of a Verb shows the time when an action takes place.
           <br/>
           There are three Tenses :
          </p>
          <p>
           I. Present Tense
           <br/>
           II. Past Tense
           <br/>
           III. Future Tense

           3. In order to show at what stage an action is, each of the three tenses has been sub-divided into four heads. These sub-divisions are—

           Thus, the tense of a verb does not show the time of an action or event alone. It shows the state of that action also.

           <strong>
            B. Present Continuous Tense
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (Is/am/are + Verb + ing)
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) In order to form the Present Continuous Tense, we add Present Participle to is, am or are. The Present Participle is formed by adding ‘ing’ to the first form of the verb.
           <br/>
           ‘Is’ is used with he, she, it or Third Person Singular Noun, ‘am is used with T and ‘are’ is used with we, you, they and plural Nouns.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Examples:
           </strong>
           She is singing a song.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) In Interrogative form, the helping verb is used before the subject.
           <br/>
           [Is/am/are + Subject + (Verb + ing)……….. ?]
           <br/>
           Examples : Are you going home ?
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) In Negative form, we add ‘not between the Principal Verb and the operative helping verb.
           <br/>
           [Subject + is/am/are + not + (Verb + ing) …]
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Examples:
           </strong>
           She is not weeping.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Uses of the Present Continuous Tense
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The Present Continuous Tense is used with the words—at this time, at present, at the moment, now, nowadays, still etc. and in the following cases :
          </p>
          <p>
           (a) To describe an action in progress and/or the continuity of the action.
           <br/>
           The girls are singing a chorus.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) To describe an action in progress, but not necessarily at the time of speaking.
           <br/>
           India is exporting onions to the Middle East.

            B. The Past Continuous Tense

            (Subject + was /were + I form of the Verb + ing…)
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) The Past Continuous Tense denotes an action going on in the past. In order to form Past Continuous Tense we add Present Participle to was or were ; as—
           <br/>
           The train was running at full speed.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) In Negative form [‘not’ is placed between the helping verb and the principal verb ; as—]
           <br/>
           (Subject + was/were + not + Verb + ing…)
           <br/>
           She was not weeping.

            Uses of the Past Continuous Tense
           </strong>
           <br/>
           (i) The Past Continuous Tense is used to express an action that was happening in the Past at the time of speaking. The time of the action may or may not be mentioned.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Examples:
           </strong>
           The old lady was crying at the top of her voice.
           <br/>
           They were not making a noise.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The use of this tense with Simple Past Tense denotes that the previous action was going on when the latter action took place; as—
           <br/>
           My mother was cooking the food when I reached home.

            C. THE PAST PERFECT TENSE
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (Subject + had + III form of the Verb )
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           We often make mistakes while using the Past Perfect Tense. We use ‘had’ at random wherever we view ‘past action’ in a sentence in our mother-tongue.
           <br/>
           I had gone to Delhi yesterday.
           <br/>
           This sentence should be formed in Simple past.
           <br/>
           I went to Delhi yesterday.
           <br/>
           The structure of Past Perfect is—
           <br/>
           In order to form the Past Perfect Tense we use ‘had’ before the Past Participle (III) form of the Verb.
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) In Interrogative form [‘Had is used before the subject]
           <br/>
           (Had + Subject + not + in form of the Verb + ……… ?)
           <br/>
           Had he left when you came ?
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) In Negative form [‘not is used after ‘had’]
           <br/>
           (Subject + had + not + III form of the Verb + ………… )
           <br/>
           I had not seen you before.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Uses of the Past Perfect Tense
           </strong>
           <br/>
           (a) The Past Perfect Tense is used to express an action completed before another action took place ; as—
           <br/>
           When he came to me, I had posted the letter.
           <br/>
           (b) (i) It is also used to express an unfulfilled action in the past ; as—
           <br/>
           If she had worked hard she would have passed.
           <br/>
           (ii) It is also used to express an unfulfilled wish in the past ; as—
           <br/>
           I wish I had won the election.
           <br/>
           (c) To denote the action or event which has been completed before some point of
           <br/>
           time.
           <br/>
           By afternoon he had completed much work.

            Use of Past Indefinite and Past Perfect Tenses in Time Clauses
           </strong>
           <br/>
           We can express time by using some ‘time-denoting’ Adverbs or through Adverbial clauses of Time. The combination of two past actions depends upon their mutual relevance.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Examples:
           </strong>
           I had waited for my friend until he arrived.
           <br/>
           After he had sailed many days, the mariner reached the coast.

            D. The Past Perfect Continuous Tense

           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           (a) The Past Perfect Continuous Tense expresses an action that had been going on for some time in the past. In order to use this tense we use had been with Present Participle (ing) form of the verb.
           <br/>
           Examples: Children had been playing since morning.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) The Past Perfect Continuous Tense is also used to express an action that had been going on for some time before another action took place in the past ; as—
           <br/>
           Examples: They had been playing chess for two hours when I joined them.
           <br/>
           (i) In Interrogative form, ‘had precedes the subject and ‘been’ comes after the subject; as—
           <br/>
           Had he been quarrelling with you for some time ?
           <br/>
           (ii) In negative form, ‘not’ is placed after ‘had’ and before ‘been’ ; as—
           <br/>
           They had not been working on this project for many years.

           <br/>
           <strong>

           </strong>
           <br/>
           The Future Indefinite Tense is used to express the action or event which is likely to happen in Future. In this tense we use shall/will between the subject and the first form of the verb. Normally we use ‘shall with pronouns of first person (I, We). In the same way. we use ‘will with the pronouns of second person (you) and third person (he, she, it, they).
           <br/>
           (i) In Negative sentences ‘not’ is added after ‘shall/‘will as the case may be ; as— We shall not see the picture today.
           <br/>
           (ii) In Interrogative sentences ‘will’/‘shall’ is placed before the subject and first form of the verb after it ; as—
           <br/>
           Will you go to college today ?
