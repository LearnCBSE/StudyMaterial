           What is the difference between a complex and a double salt?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Double salt dissociates cornplctel’ into its constituent ions in their aqueous solution.
           <br/>
           Example: KCl.MgCl

           Propanamine and N, N-dimethylmethanamine contain the same number of carbon atoms, even though Propanamine has higher boiling point than N, N-dimethylmethanamine. Why?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Propanamine has higher boiling point than N, N-dimethylmethanamine because it has intermolecular hydrogen-bonding due’to two hydrogen atoms of CH
           <sub>

           Question 6.
           <br/>
           Give reasons for the following: [2]
           <br/>
           (a) Aquatic species are more comfortable in cold water than in warm water.
           <br/>
           (b) At higher altitudes people suffer from anoxia resulting in inability to think.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Aquatic species need dissolved oxygen for breathing. As solubility of gases decreases with increase of temperature, less oxygen is available in summer in the lake. Hence the aquatic species feel more comfortable in winter (low temperature) when the solubility of oxygen is higher.
           <br/>
           (b) At higher altitude people suffer from anoxia because the partial pressure of oxygen is less than at the ground level due to which the concentration of oxygen in the blood and tissues decreases. .

           What type of azeotropic mixture will be formed by a solution of acetone and chloroform? Justify on the basis of strength of intermolecular interactions that develop in the solution.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Minimum boiling azeotropes will be formed by a solution of acetone and chloroform. In positive deviation, the liquid pairs A-B have weak mtpraction forces than that of A – A or B – B molecular interaction forces.

           Question 7.
           <br/>
           Explain with a graph, the variation of molar conductivity of a strong electrolyte with dilution. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In case of strong electrolytes there is a small increase in conductance with dilution because it is completely dissociated in solution and number of ions remains constant.
           <br/>

           Answer:
           <br/>
           (b) p-isomers are comparatively more symmetrical and fit closely in the crystal lattice thus require more heat to break these strong forces of attraction. Therefore higher melting point than o- and m-isomers.

           <br/>
           (c)
           <br/>
           Cationic detergents. They are quaternary ammonium salts of amines with acetates, chlorides or bromides as anions and the çationic part possess a long hydrocarbon chain, and a positive charge on nitrogen atom. Therefore they are called cationic detergents.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           Powdered substances are more effective because the surface area of powdered form is more than crystalline form, which also further increases physiosorption.

           Question 16.
           <br/>
           Give reasons for the following: [1 × 3 = 3]
           <br/>
           (a) Brownian movement provides stability to the colloidal solution.
           <br/>
           (b) True solution does not show Tyndall effect.
           <br/>
           (c) Addition of alum purifies the water.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Brownian movement provides stability to the colloidal solution because it opposes the gravitational force acting on colloidal particles and prevents them from settling down.
           <br/>
           (b) In true solution, the diameter of the dispersed particles is much smaller than the wavelength of the light used, hence there is no scattering of light.
           <br/>
           (c) Addition of alum purifies the water as alum coagulates the colloidal impurities present in water so that these impurities get settled down and removed by decantation or filtration.

           Question 7.
           <br/>
           Using the E° values of X and Y, predict which is better for coating the surface of iron to prevent rust and why? [2]
           <br/>
           Given: [\(\mathrm{E}_{\left(\mathrm{Fe}^{2+} / \mathrm{Fe}\right)}^{\mathrm{o}}\) = -0.44V; \(\mathbf{E}_{\left(X^2 / X\right)}\) = -2.36V; \(\mathbf{E}_{\left(\mathrm{Y}^{2+} / \mathrm{Y}\right)}\) = -0.14V]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Since Y has lower reduction potential (\(E^{\circ}{ }_{Y^{2+} / Y}\) = – 0.14V) than Iron (\(\mathrm{E}^{\circ} \mathrm{Fe}^{2+} / \mathrm{Fe}\) = 0.44V) so it is more reactive metal than iron and can be easily oxidized in preference to X which has higher negative reduction potential. Thus X is better for coating the surface of iron to prevent rust.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Sol. The colloids in which a solid is dispersed in the liquid. In other words, in a colloidal sol, the dispersed phase is a solid and the dispersion medium is a liquid.
           <br/>
           (b) Aerosol. Aerosol is a colloidal solution of solid or liquid (dispersed phase) in gas (dispersion medium). Example. smoke, dust, fog, mist, cloud.
           <br/>
           (C) A hydrosol. The colloidal solution where water is used as the dispersion medium is called hydrosol or aquasol. Example. Starch sol.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Those drugs which are used for treatment of depression by inhibiting the enzymes which catalyse the degradation of noradrenaline are called Antidepressants.
           <br/>
           For example. Iproniazid and Pheneizine.
           <br/>
           (b) The sweetening agent used in the preparation of sweets for a diabetic patient is
           <br/>
           Saccharin.
           <br/>
           (c) Soaps are sodium potassium salts of long chain fatty acids and being soluble in water can easily be decomposed by microorganisms while detergents are NH
           <sub>

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Native protein is the protein which is found in a biological system having a unique three-dimensional structure and specific biological activity.
           <br/>
           Denatured protein is the protein which is formed by coagulation of native protein when it is subjected to change in pH or in temperature.
           <br/>
           (b) Lactose is a disaccharide
           <br/>

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Due to presence of inter-molecular H-bonding, associated molecules are formed. Hence butanol has high boiling point while diethyl ether does not have inter molecular H-bonding.
