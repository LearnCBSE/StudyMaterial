           Give two advantages of ‘wind energy’. Mention four states of India having favourable conditions for the development of wind energy. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The advantages of wind energy are :
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            The wind is free and with modern technology it can be captured efficiently.
           </li>
           <li>
            Once the wind turbine is built the energy it produces does not cause greenhouse gases or other pollutants.
           </li>
           <li>
            Although wind turbines can be very tall each takes up only a small plot of land.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           This means that the land below can still be used. This is especially the case in agricultural areas as farming can still continue.

           Two types of international trade are :
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Bilateral Trade : This type of trade is done by two countries with each other. They enter into agreement to trade specified commodites amongst them.
           </li>
           <li>
            Multilateral Trade : This type of trade is conducted with many countries. The same country can trade with a number of other countries. The country may also grant the status of the ‘Most Favoured Nation’ (MFN) on some of the trading partners.
           </li>

           Question 23.
           <br/>
           Explain any five factors that affect the location of rural settlements of the world. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The factors that affect the location of rural settlements of the World are:
           <br/>
           (i) Water Supply : Usually rural settlements are located near water bodies such as rivers, lakes and springs where water can be easily obtained. The need for water drives people to settle in islands surrounded by swamps or low lying riverbanks. Water supply is main factor because water is used for drinking, cooking and washing, rivers and lakes can be used to irrigate farm land, water bodies also have fish which can be caught for diet and navigable rivers and lakes can be used for transportation.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Land: People choose to settle near fertile lands suitable for agriculture. Early settlers chose plain areas with fertile soils. In Europe villagers are found near gently sloping land, in south East Asia villages are near low lying river valleys and coastal plains suited for wet rice cultivation.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Upland: Villages are located on uplands, which is not prone to flooding. Thus, in low-lying river basins people chose to settle on terraces and levees, which are “dry points”.
           <br/>
           In tropical countries people build their houses on stilts near marshy lands to protect themselves from flood, insects and animal pests.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) Building Material: The availability of building materials— wood, stone near settlements is another factor. Early villages were built in forests where wood was plentiful. In African Savanna’s mud bricks are used as building materials and the Eskimos, in Polar Regions, use ice blocks to construct igloos.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) Defence : During the times of political instability, war, aggression of neighboring groups, villages were built on defensive hills and islands. In Nigeria, villages are built on upstanding rocks; in India most of the forts are located on hills.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 24.
           <br/>
           Examine any five push factors that cause ‘migration of population’ in India. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Large number of young people are migrating because rural India is saturated and cannot provide employment opportunities for a growing population.
           </li>
           <li>
            Most women migrants have migrated after marriage. In North India, women are not supposed to marry a man from the same village. So invariably marriage means migration. ,
           </li>
           <li>
            Many end up as rag pickers or casual construction workers. Many don’t get employment throughout the year and commute between urban and rural areas. After the harvest, they migrate to urban areas for a few months before the rainy season.
           </li>
           <li>
            Intolerance towards a certain class, sector cultural group also causes migration.
           </li>
           <li>
            Natural disasters or epidemics are also causes of migration because it causes outbreaks of diseases which may be life-threatening.
           </li>
          </ol>

           <li>
            National highways form the economic backbone of the country and have often facilitated development along their routes, and many new towns have sprung up along major highways.
           </li>
           <li>
            It connects almost all mega cities. Basically these are meant for inter-state transport.

           <br/>
           Explain any five patterns of rural settlements in the world with the help of suitable diagrams. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           On the basis of forms of shapes, the 5 patterns of rural settlements in the world are :
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Linear Pattern:
            <ul>
             <li>
              These type of setdements have two parallel rows of houses facing each other.
             </li>
             <li>
              In such setdements, houses are located along a road, railway line, river or a canal edge.
             </li>
             <li>
              These type of setdements are common in coastal Kerala, Manipur, Bala Ghat, Mandala and Raigrah districts of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.
             </li>
             <li>
              Linear setdements are also common feature of Nagaland.
             </li>
             <li>
              Fishing villages in the coastal areas also look like linear cluster.
             </li>
            </ul>
           </li>
           <li>
            Rectangular Pattern :
            <ul>
             <li>
              Such villages develop at the meeting place of two roads.
             </li>
             <li>
              The streets are either parallel or perpendicular to each other and the settlement takes a rectangular shape.
             </li>
             <li>
              These type of settlements are more common in the Northern plain especially in the Ganga-Yamuna Doab.
             </li>
             <li>
              These settlements are also found in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and the states of South India.
             </li>
            </ul>
           </li>
           <li>
            Circular Pattern :
            <ul>
             <li>
              When the houses are constructed along a bank of a pond or a lake, the settlement takes the shape of circle and is known as circular pattern.
             </li>
             <li>
              These type of settlements are mainly found
              <br/>
              in Upper Ganga-Yamuna Doab, Trans-Yamuna region and in parts of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra.
             </li>
            </ul>
           </li>
           <li>
            Star-like Pattern :
            <ul>
             <li>
              A village acquires a star-like pattern when streets radiate from a common centre.
             </li>
             <li>
              Expansion of these villages due to population growth leads to the formation of a double radial pattern. In this pattern, several roads converge star shaped settlements developed by houses built along the roads.
             </li>
             <li>
              This type of pattern is more common in Tamil Nadu and Upper Ganga Plain.
             </li>
            </ul>
           </li>
           <li>
            T-shaped Pattern : Villages and towns confined between two rivers at their junction or confluence or between bifurcations of two roads eventually result in a T-shape pattern. Such pattern develops at tri-junction of roads.
           </li>
          </ol>
