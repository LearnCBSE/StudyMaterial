           <br/>
           (a) (i) and (iii)
           <br/>
           (b) (ii) and (iii)
           <br/>
           (c) (ii) and (iv)
           <br/>
           (d) (i) and (iv)

           <br/>
           (c) (ii) and (iv)
           <br/>
           The correct combination is (ii) and (iv) as [1]
           <br/>
           (i) When Al reacts with NaOH, the salt of aluminium is formed with the evolution of hydrogen gas.
           <br/>
           2Al (s) + 6NaOH (aq) → 2Na

           <br/>
           (ii) When silver and sodium hydroxide react together, no reaction occurs. Hence no evolution of gas occurs.
           <br/>
           (iii) Magnesium and sodium hydroxide do not react with each other. Hence, no evolution of gas.
           <br/>
           (iv) When zinc reacts with sodium hydroxide, zinc salt is formed by the evolution of hydrogen gas.

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Dominant alleles are expressed exclusively in a heterozygote, while recessive traits are expressed only if the organism is ……………… for the recessive allele.
           <br/>
           (a) Homozygous
           <br/>
           (b) Heterozygous
           <br/>
           (c) Normal
           <br/>
           (d) None of these
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Homozygous
           <br/>
           Explanation: According to Mendel’s law of dominance, when there is a heterozygote (an organism with two different alleles for a trait), one allele will dominate and mask the presence of the other allele. Only the dominant allele will be expressed and contribute to the physical characteristics (phenotype). The recessive allele remains hidden but can still be passed on to offspring in the same way as the dominant allele. The recessive trait will only be visible in offspring who inherit two copies of this recessive allele.

           Question 3.
           <br/>
           __________ can be used as an acid-base indicator by a visually impaired student.
           <br/>
           (a) Litmus
           <br/>
           (b) Vanilla essence
           <br/>
           (c) Turmeric
           <br/>
           (d) Petunia leaves
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (b) Vanilla essence
           <br/>
           Vanilla essence is an olfactory indicator. So, its smell is different in acidic and basic media which can be detected easily by a visually impaired student. It has a characteristic pleasant smell. If a basic solution like sodium hydroxide solution is added to it, an acidic solution like hydrochloric acid, however, does not destroy the smell of Vanilla extract.

           Question 6.
           <br/>
           A farmer wants to grow banana plants genetically similar enough to the plants already available in his field. Which one of the following methods would you suggest for this purpose?
           <br/>
           (a) Regeneration
           <br/>
           (b) Budding
           <br/>
           (c) Vegetative propagation
           <br/>
           (d) Sexual reproduction
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (c) Vegetative propagation
           <br/>
           Explanation: Vegetative propagation is a method of plant reproduction that involves using vegetative parts of a plant, such as stems, roots, or leaves, to create new individuals that are genetically identical to the parent plant. This method ensures that the desired characteristics of the parent plant, including fruit quality and traits, are preserved in the new plants. This method avoids the genetic variation that can occur through sexual reproduction, which involves the combination of genetic material from two different parent plants and may result in offspring with different traits.

           Question 18.
           <br/>
           Assertion: Electric current flowing through a metallic wire is directly proportional to the potential difference across its ends.
           <br/>
           Reason: Ohm’s law expression V = IR, where R (resistance) of the wire is always varying.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (c) A is true, but R is false.
           <br/>
           Explanation: Ohm’s law states that the electric current flowing through a metallic wire is directly proportional to the potential difference across its two ends. The expression is written as :
           <br/>
           V = IR
           <br/>
           Here, R (resistance of the wire) is a constant value, so only the statement will be valid.

           Goitre is caused by which endocrine gland? Write one primary prevention.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Explain the functions of a neuron.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Goitre is caused by the deficiency of thyroxine hormone secreted by the thyroid gland. Uptaking an optimum amount of iodine helps in preventing this disease. In hilly areas, iodine is deficient in water which causes goitre disease in most of the population in that area. Iodized salt uptake can help in the prevention of this disease. (2)

           Functions of a neuron The neuron receives information from receptors as electrical impulses, at its dendritic end. The impulse then travels from the dendrite to the cell body and further along the axon to its end. At the end of the axon, an electrical impulse leads to the release of some chemicals. These chemicals cross the synapse and reach the next neuron. This is how nerve impulses travel through the body. Thus, neurons are important in receiving information from the surroundings and in sending it to the effector. (2)

           (i) Identify the type of bonding in graphite.
           <br/>
           (ii) Which property of graphite makes it suitable for use as a dry lubricant? Explain.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Between the carbon atoms in each layer covalent bond is found and Van Der Waal’s forces are found between the layers of carbon atoms in graphite.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Graphite is soft which makes it suitable for use as a dry lubricant. Between the carbon atoms in each layer covalent bond is found and weak Van Der Waals forces are found between the layers of carbon atoms in graphite. So, the layers can slide over one another making it a relatively soft substance.

           Question 25.
           <br/>
           What are magnetic field lines? Justify the following statements.
           <br/>
           (a) Two magnetic field lines never intersect each other.
           <br/>
           (b) Magnetic field lines are closed curves.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           You have two electric lamps having ratings 40 W, 220 V and 60 W, 220 V. Which of the two has a higher resistance? Give a reason for your answer. If these two lamps are connected to a source of 220 V, which will glow brighter?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The imaginary lines representing the magnetic field around a magnet are known as magnetic field lines.
           <br/>
           (a) If two field lines intersect each other, this would mean that at the point of intersection, the direction of the magnetic field is in two directions, which is not possible. (1)
           <br/>
           (b) The direction of field lines outside a magnet is from the North pole to the South pole while it is from the South to the North pole inside the magnet and thus forms closed curves. (1)
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           We know that, power, P = \(\frac{V^2}{R}\)
           <br/>
           Thus, resistance is inversely proportional to power, i.e., higher power less will be resistance and vice-versa. So, the electric lamp with a power rating of 40 W will have a higher resistance as compared to a 60 W lamp. Lamps with higher power will glow brighter. Hence, a lamp with 60 W power will glow brighter.

           Gold and silver do not react with any form of water.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           The metals in the middle of the reactivity series (such as iron, zinc, lead, copper, etc.) are moderately reactive. Thus, to obtain such metals from their compounds, their sulphides and carbonates are first converted into their oxides by the process of roasting and calcination respectively and then the metal oxides are reduced to corresponding metal by using suitable reducing agents such as carbon. (2)
           <br/>
           On the other hand, metals which are high up in the reactivity series (such as sodium, magnesium, calcium, aluminium, etc.) are very reactive and cannot be obtained from their compound by heating with carbon. Therefore, such metals are obtained by electrolytic reduction of their molten salt. (1)

           Question 28.
           <br/>
           Obtain an expression for the magnification of an image formed by a concave mirror.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Consider the formation of the image A’B’ of an object AB by a concave mirror. As shown in given
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 10 Science Set 6 with Solutions 9" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-101779" height="160" loading="lazy" src="https://www.cbsetuts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-Science-Set-6-with-Solutions-9.png" width="254"/>
           <br/>
           \(\frac{\mathrm{A}^{\prime} \mathrm{B}^{\prime}}{\mathrm{AB}}=\frac{\mathrm{PB}^{\prime}}{\mathrm{PB}}\)
           <br/>
           As per sign convention followed, PB = – u, PB’ = – υ, AB = size of the object = + h and A’B’ = size of the
           <br/>
           image – h’.
           <br/>
           Hence, we have
           <br/>
           \(\frac{-h^{\prime}}{h}=\frac{-v}{-u}\)
           <br/>
           or \(\frac{h^{\prime}}{h}=\frac{-v}{u}\)

           Thus, by definition of magnification of the image, we have

           Question 34.
           <br/>
           Explain the nutrition process in Amoeba.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           (i) Explain the statement “Bile does not contain any enzyme but it is essential for digestion”.
           <br/>
           (ii) Explain the process of breathing in human beings.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Amoeba follows holozoic nutrition.
           <br/>
           It involves the following steps:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Ingestion – Amoeba engulfs the food by using its temporary finger-like projections called pseudopodia. This process is called ingestion.
           </li>
           <li>
            Digestion – The food which is taken inside the amoeba forms a food vacuole. Many enzymes are secreted into the food vacuole and the complex food molecule is converted into a simple and diffusible form.
           </li>
           <li>
            Absorption and assimilation – The digested food is absorbed by the cell by the diffusion process.
           </li>
           <li>
            Egestion – The undigested residue which remains in the vacuole is expelled.
           </li>
          </ol>

           OR
           <br/>
           (i) Though bile juice secreted by liver has no enzymes in it is still essential for digestion because:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            It makes the medium alkaline in the small intestine so that intestinal juice can perform its functions because the food from stomach which enters the small intestine is acidic in nature.
           </li>
           <li>
            It emulsifies fats so that enzymes like lipase can act upon fats to convert them into fatty acids and glycerol.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           (ii) Breathing process occurs by inhalation and exhalation.
           <br/>
           1. Inhalation: It is the process by which oxygen is taken in through nostrils. During inhalation process, the ribs move upwards and outwards due to contraction of intercostal muscles. The diaphragm is lowered so that the volume of thoracic cavity increases. As a result air is forced inside the lungs through nostrils.
          </p>
          <p>
           2. Exhalation: It is the process by which carbon dioxide is exhaled out from lungs through nostrils. During this process the ribs moves inwards and diaphragm comes back to its original position. The volume of thoracic cavity decreases so air is forced out through the lungs.

           Question 35.
           <br/>
           (a) Marriage between cousins is a taboo in most of the countries of the world except in some Asian countries. Why should marriage between close cousins be prevented and which measures will you take to prevent such practices?
           <br/>
           (b) Describe the process of fertilization in a flower.

           (a) Explain the events of double circulation.
           <br/>
           (b) Differentiate between fermentation in yeast and aerobic respiration based on the end products formed.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Marriage between close cousins should be prevented as the recessive traits with the genetic defects present in such families will become homozygous and cause harmful diseases Children should be educated about the ill effects so that they come to know about the defects in marriages among close cousins. These are the measures that can be taken to prevent such practices. (2)

          <p>
           (b) It is the process of fusion of male germ cells with the female gametes. It gives rise to a zygote. As soon as the pollen lands on a suitable stigma, it reaches the female germ cells in the ovary. This occurs via pollen tube. The pollen tube grows out of the pollen grain, travels through the style, and finally reaches the ovary. The fertilization In the flowering plant is shown in the given figure.

           <br/>
           After fertilization, the zygote divides many times and forms an embryo within the ovule. This ovule then develops a tough coat and gets converted into a seed. The ovary rapidly grows and ripens as fruit. The seed contains the future embryo that develops into a seedling under suitable conditions. This process is known as germination. (3)

           (a) During double circulation in human beings, the blood passes twice through the heart during one complete cycle of circulation. The double circulation includes the following processes. (1)
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Pulmonary circulation: In this, the deoxygenated blood is pushed by the right ventricle to the lungs for oxygenation. The oxygenated blood then comes back to the left atrium of the heart through the pulmonary veins. (1)
           </li>
           <li>
            Systemic circulation: In this circulation, oxygenated blood from the left ventricle of the heart is passed to the different parts of the body through the aorta. Such a separation allows a highly efficient supply of oxygen to the body. This is useful in animals that have high energy needs such as birds and mammals including human beings, which constantly use energy to maintain their body temperature.

           (ii) Given, Magnification, m = – 3 (As the image is real), Object distance, u = – 20 cm
           <br/>
           We have, m = –\(\frac{υ}{u}\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ – 3 = – \(\left(\frac{υ}{-20}\right)\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ υ = – 60 cm

           Question 38.
           <br/>
           Stomata are tiny pores present on the surface of the leaves. Massive amounts of gaseous exchange take place in the leaves through these pores for photosynthesis. But it is important to note here that the exchange of gases occurs across the surface of stems, roots, and leaves as well. Since large amounts of water can also be lost through these stomata, the plant closes these pores when it does not need carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. The opening and closing of the pore is a function of the guard cells. The guard cells swell when water flows into them, causing the stomatal pores to open. Similarly, the pore closes if the guard cells shrink.
           <br/>
           1. Take two healthy potted plants which are nearly the same size.
           <br/>
           2. Keep them in a dark room for three days.
           <br/>
           3. Now, place each plant on separate glass plates. Place a watch glass containing potassium hydroxide by the side of one of the plants.
           <br/>
           4. The potassium hydroxide is used to absorb carbon dioxide.
           <br/>
           5. Cover both plants with separate bell jars.
           <br/>
           6. Use Vaseline to seal the bottom of the jars to the glass plates so that the set-up is air-tight.
           <br/>
           7. Keep the plants in sunlight for about two hours.
           <br/>
           8. Pluck a leaf from each plant and check for the presence of starch as in the above activity.
           <br/>
           (a) What can be concluded from the activity?
           <br/>
           (b) What is the function of stomata?
           <br/>
           (c) How do the guard cells control the opening and closing of stomata?
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           In the above activity, do both the leaves show the same amount of starch?

           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) It shows that the amount of carbon dioxide affects the process and outcome of photosynthesis.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Massive amounts of gaseous exchange take place in the leaves through these pores for photosynthesis.

           (b) What will be the position of the image? If the object is placed between the focus and center of curvature.
           <br/>
           (c) If the object is placed at a distance of 10 cm in front of the mirror X, then what will be the distance of the image formed? [Take, magnification = -3]
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           What will happen, if the upper half of the concave mirror ‘X’ is covered?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) In this case, the image formed is virtual, erect, and magnified. The image is formed behind the optical device X. Hence, device X is a concave mirror. When the object is placed between the pole and the focus of a concave mirror, the image formed will be virtual, erect, magnified, and behind the mirror. (1)
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Concave mirror X will form the magnified image of the object as the object is placed between the focus and centre of curvature of the mirror. (1)

           <br/>
           (c) Given, object distance, u = -10 cm
           <br/>
           Magnification, m = -3
           <br/>
           Now, m = \(-\frac{v}{u}\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ -3 = \(-\frac{v}{(-10)}\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ v = -30 cm
           <br/>
           The negative sign shows that the image is real and in front of the mirror. (2)
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           If the upper half of the concave mirror is covered, the focal length of the mirror and object distance do not change, then the brightness of the image will be reduced. (1)
           <br/>
           This is because the whole image will be formed by the rays passing through the upper half portion but the intensity of the image formed is proportional to the number of rays and hence the image will be less brighter. (1)
