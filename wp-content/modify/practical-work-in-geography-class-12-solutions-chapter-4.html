           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When we use computer, it is less time consuming and the results arrived are more reliable but manual data processing takes too much time and results are not so reliable

           Question 2(iii).
           <br/>
           What is a worksheet?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A worksheet is a rectangular table (or grid) to store information. The worksheets are located in Workbooks or Excel files. Most of the MS Excel screen is devoted to the display of the worksheet, which consists of rows and columns. The intersection of a row and column is a rectangular area, which is called a cell. In other words, a worksheet is made up of cells. A cell can contain a numerical value, a formula (which after calculation provides numerical value) or text. Texts are generally used for labelling numbers entered in the cells. A value entry can either be a number (entered directly) or result of a formula. The value of a formula will change when the components (arguments) of the formula change.

          </p>
          <p>
           Question 3(i).
           <br/>
           What is difference between spatial and non-spatial data? Explain with examples.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Spatial Data: The spatial data represent a geographical space. They are characterised by the points, lines and the polygons. The point data represent positional characteristics of some of the geographical features such as schools, hospitals, wells, tube- wells, towns and villages, etc. on the map. In other words, if we want to present occurrence of the objects on a map in dimensionless scale but with reference to location, we use points.
          </p>
          <p>
           Similarly, lines are used to depict linear features like roads, railway lines, canals, rivers, power and communication lines, etc. Polygons are made up of a number of inter-connected lines bounding a certain area and are used to show area features such as administrative units (countries, districts, states, blocks); land use types (cultivated area, forest lands, degraded/wastelands, pastures, etc.) and features like ponds, lakes, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
           Non-spatial Data: The data describing the information about spatial data are called as non-spatial or attribute data. For example, if you have a map showing positional location of your school you can attach the information such as the name of the school, subject stream it offers, number of students in each class, schedule of admissions, teaching and examinations, available facilities like library, labs, equipments, etc. In other words, you will be defining the attributes of the spatial data. Thus, non-spatial data are also known as attribute-data.
           <br/>
           Sources of Geographical Data: The geographical data are available in analogue (map and aerial photographs) or digital form (scanned images).

           Question 3(ii).
           <br/>
           What are the three forms of geographical data in computer?
           <br/>
           Answer: There are three forms of geographical data in a computer. The extensions of these files are shp, shx and dbf. The dbf file is dbase file that contains attribute data and is linked to shx and shp files. The shx and shp files, on the other hand, contain spatial (map) information. The dbf file can be edited in MS Excel.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           We solve arithmetic expressions in the following sequence. First of all, brackets are solved. Thereafter division and then multiplication is done. There after addition and subtraction is done. In short the rule of BODMAS is followed. It can be understood by an example.
           <br/>
           = 20 x 2/4 + (10 – 8 + 2)2 = 20 x 2/4 + (4)2 = 20 x 2/4 + 16
           <br/>
           = 40/4 + 16 = 10 + 16
           <br/>
           = 26
           <br/>
           In MS Excel, it will be expressed as Fx = SUM (A1 x B1/C1 + D1) x E1

           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Which measures of central tendency can be measured from MS excel? Explain any one of them.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Central tendencies include mean, median and mode. They can be calculated using MS Excel. MS Excel calls it average. Following steps for measuring mean are as follows:
           <br/>
           Step-1: Enter year-wise cropping intensity data in a worksheet.
          </p>
          <p>
           Step-2: Click on cell B12 using mouse.
          </p>
          <p>
           Step-3: Click on Insert Menu and choose f x, this will open Insert Function dialogue box. Step-4: Select Statistical from select a category menu on the dialogue box. This will bring forth the statistical functions available in Excel in the box below in the same dialogue box.
          </p>
          <p>
           Step-5: In the box, select a Function, click on Average, and press OK button. This will open another dialogue box called Function Argument.
          </p>
          <p>
           Step-6: Either enter the cell range of data of the first decade CI_50s (which shows year-wise cropping intensity in 1950s) in the Number 1 box on Function Argument dialogue box of data, or drag cursor pressing the left button of mouse over the cell range of data.
          </p>
          <p>
           Step-7: Press OK button on the Function Argument dialogue box. This calculates mean cropping intensity for the decade 1950s in cell B12, where you had put your cursor in the beginning.
          </p>
          <p>
           Step-8: Now calculate the mean for other decade either the following steps 1-7 given above or dragging cursor right handward in the same row selecting the small square from rectangle of cell B12 or you can copy the cell B12 and paste it on D12, F12, H12 and J12. This will give you mean value of cropping intensity for the decades 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, respectively. It is shown with the help of following diagrams:

          </h4>
          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           What is spatial data?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The spatial data represent a geographical space. They are characterised by the points, lines and the polygons. The point data represent positional characteristics of some of the geographical features such as schools, hospitals, wells, tube- wells, towns and villages, etc. on the map.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           What is Non-spatial data?
           <br/>
           Answer: The data describing the information about spatial data are called non-spatial or attribute data. For example, if you have a map showing positional location of your school you can attach the information such as the name of the school, subject stream it offers, numbers of students in each class, schedule of admissions, teaching and examinations, available facilities like library, labs, equipments, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           What is a mapping software?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A mapping software provides functions for spatial and attribute data input through onscreen digitisation of scanned maps, corrections of errors, transformation of scale and projection, data integration, map design, presentation and analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           What is a digitised map?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A digitised map consists of three files. The extensions of these files are shp, shx and dbf. The dbf file is dbase file that contains attribute data and is linked to shx and shp files. The shx and shp files, on the other hand, contain spatial (map) information. The dbf file can be edited in MS Excel.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>

            There are some important norms for data representation :
           </li>
           <li>
            A figure should have its figure number.
           </li>
           <li>
            It should have a suitable title in which time and space it relates to should also be mentioned.
           </li>
           <li>
            Within title or as sub-title, the unit in which the quantities are shown should be mentioned.
           </li>
           <li>
            The title, sub-title, title of axes, legend and the main presentation should be shown with suitable font size and type so that they occupy space in a balanced manner.
           </li>
           <li>
            There are specific diagrams and graphs suitable for data types:
            <ul>
             <li>
              Time series data are represented through line graphs or bar diagram,
             </li>
             <li>
              Bar diagrams and histograms are generally used for showing shares or frequencies of various units,
             </li>
             <li>
              Compound bar diagrams, and pie-charts are used for showing shares of various units,
             </li>
             <li>
              Maps are used for location-wise representation of data. This helps in comprehending spatial patterns in the data.

           Use of Computer in Data Processing and Mapping Important Terms
          </h4>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Computer: A computer is an electronic device. It consists of various sub-systems like memory, micro-processor, input system and output system. All these sub-systems work together to make it an integrated system.
           </li>
           <li>
            CPU: The core of modern computers consists of a central processing unit (CPU), which facilitates the execution of program instructions for processing data and controlling peripheral equipments. All data together with the operating system and the application programs occupy space in disk storage unit which functions as working memory.
           </li>
           <li>
            Input Devices: The instruction and the statistical data are entered into the computer using the keyboard functions.
           </li>
           <li>
            Output Devices: The output devices include a variety of printers such as ink-jet, laser and colour laser printers; and the plotters that are available in different sizes ranging from A3 to AO size.
           </li>
           <li>
            Computer Software: Computer software is a written program that is stored in memory. It performs specific functions as per the instructions given by the user.
           </li>
           <li>
            The Data Entry and Editing Modules: These inbuilt modules in the data processing and mapping software facilitate the data entry system interface, database creation, error removal, scale and projection manipulations, their organisation, and maintenance of the data. Any of these and other related data entry, editing and management capabilities might be performed using displayed menus and icons on the screen.
           </li>
           <li>
            Spreadsheet: A spreadsheet is a rectangular table (or grid) to store information. The spreadsheets are located in Workbooks or Excel files. Most of the MS Excel screen is devoted to the display of the worksheet, which consists of rows and columns.
           </li>
           <li>
            Spatial Data: The spatial data represent a geographical space. They are characterised by the points, lines and the polygons. The point data represent positional characteristics of some of the geographical features such as schools, hospitals, wells, tube- wells, towns and villages, etc. on the map.
           </li>
           <li>
            Non-Spatial Data: The data describing the information about spatial data are called as non-spatial or attribute data. For example, if you have a map showing positional location of your school you can attach the information such as the name of the school, subject stream it offers, number of students in each class, schedule of admissions, teaching and examinations, available facilities like library, labs, equipments, etc.
           </li>
           <li>
            Mapping Software: A mapping software provides functions for spatial and attribute data input through onscreen digitisation of scanned maps, corrections of errors, transformation of scale and projection, data integration, map design, presentation and analysis.
           </li>
           <li>
            Digitised Map: A digitised map consists of three files. The extensions of these files are shp, shx and dbf. The dbf file is dbase file that contains attribute data and is linked to shx and shp files. The shx and shp files, on the other hand, contain spatial (map) information. The dbf file can be edited in MS Excel.
           </li>
          </ul>
