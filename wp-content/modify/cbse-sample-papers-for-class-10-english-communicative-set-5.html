           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the following passage. (12 m)
          </p>
          <p>
           1. Ozone is a gas in the lower level of the stratosphere. It is a kind of super-charged oxygen (O
           <sub>
            3
           </sub>
           ). It makes a layer in the atmosphere which acts as a cover to the Earth against ultraviolet radiation of the Sun. The canopy of ozone layer is with variable extent less dense near the surface of the Earth compared to the height of 30 km.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           2. Some pollutants in the atmosphere like Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) cause the depletion of ozone layer. These CFCs and other similar gases, when they reach the stratosphere, are broken down by ultraviolet radiation and as a result they liberate free atoms of chlorine or bromine. The reactions deplete the ozone layer.
          </p>
          <p>
           3. Due to depletion of the ozone layer, the Earth is exposed to ultraviolet radiation. These rays cause harmful effects to living beings on the Earth. It affects the process of photosynthesis in plants due to rise in Earth’s temperature. Various skin diseases, decrease of immunity, etc. are the probable results. For protection of the ozone layer, the Vienna Conference in March, 1985 was held. In September 1987, Montreal Protocol was signed. This was followed by the Kyoto Protocol of 1997.
          </p>
          <p>
           4. The Kyoto Protocol is a protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC or FCCC), aimed at fighting global warming. The protocol was initially adopted on 11th December, 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, and came into force on 16th February, 2005. As on September 2011, 191 states have signed and ratified the protocol.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           5. Under the protocol, 37 countries commit themselves to a reduction of four Green House Gases (GHG) (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, sulphur hexafluoride) and two groups of gases (hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons) produced by them, and all member countries give similar commitments.
          </p>
          <p>
           6. Apart from these international ramifications, various conferences and programmes are also held all over the world regularly to protect the ozone layer. 16th September is declared as the International Day for Preservation of Ozone by the Montreal Protocol (1987). (336 words)

          <p>
           (ii) What is the effect of ozone layer depiction on animals? (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The animals are exposed to harmful ultraviolet radiations due to ozone layer depletion. Thus, they suffer from various skin diseases and decreased immunity among many other diseases.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) What happens after the depletion of the ozone layer? (1)
           <br/>
           (a) The Earth is exposed to the UV rays
           <br/>
           (b) Climate change and global warming
           <br/>
           (C) Extinction of species
           <br/>
           (d) All of the above
           <br/>
           Answer:

          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) How do Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) cause depletion of the ozone layer? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When Chlorofluorocarbons reach the stratosphere, they are broken down by ultraviolet rays.
           <br/>
           This reaction depletes the ozone layer.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) How are plants affected by Ozone layer depletion? (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Due to ozone layer depletion, the temperature of the surface of the Earth rises. This affects the process of photosynthesis in plants.

           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Explain the structure and purpose of a historical artifact that you saw in a picture the other day while scrolling the internet in not more than 100 words. [4]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The historical artifact I recently came across in a picture online was an ancient Egyptian sarcophagus. This stone coffin’s structure was a meticulously carved and ornate rectangular box, often adorned with intricate hieroglyphics and elaborate artwork. Its purpose was to serve as the final resting place for a deceased individual, typically a person of high social or religious significance. Inside, the mummy of the deceased would be carefully placed, preserving the body for the afterlife according to Egyptian beliefs. Sarcophagi like these offer invaluable insights into the art, culture, and burial practices of ancient Egypt, making them significant historical artifacts.

           Need to Tap Sports Talent at a Young Age Sir/Ma’am
          </p>
          <p>
           Through the columns of your esteemed newspaper I would like to highlight the need to tap the sports talent at a young age by sports teachers, coaches etc. so, that it does not go unrecognised. We tend to give academics priority at the expense of sports and other activities. I think we should give equal importance to studies and sports. A lot of juniors and subjuniors do well at the national level but they do not continue because there is lack of attention and guidance regarding their future in sports.
          </p>
          <p>
           There is a lot of talent in our country. The only thing required is to bring it forward and encourage it. There are many examples before us like that of PV Sindhu, Virat Kohli, Sania Nehwal, Geeta Phogat and many others who had started their rigorous training at a very young age. The result is undeniably remarkable. Yet these achievements are not enough for a country of our size and population.
          </p>
          <p>
           Therefore, it is greatly required that we should nurture sports talent from a very young age. At school, district, and state levels, sports talent must be spotted, encouraged and given proper coaching. In some cases, financial help and hostel facilities should also be provided to them. The need of the hour is to create good infrastructure for sports and nurture talent from an early age.
          </p>
          <p>
           I hope my suggestions will reach the concerned people and efforts will be made to implement some strategies.
          </p>

           <br/>
           (a) Inclusive Education: Not an alternative but an inevitability -By Akash
           <br/>
           Inclusive education is not merely an alternative; it is an absolute inevitability in our ever-evolving society.
           <br/>
           It encompasses the principle that every student, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, has the right to receive an education that suits their needs. Several factors play a pivotal role in making inclusive education an imperative rather than a choice.
           <br/>
           Firstly, attitudes are crucial. The attitudes of parents, teachers, classmates, and society at large must be inclusive and empathetic. Acceptance and support can transform educational environments into nurturing spaces for all students.
           <br/>
           Secondly, physical and infrastructural support is essential to ensure accessibility for students with disabilities. Without suitable facilities, the inclusivity we aspire to achieve remains a distant dream.
           <br/>
           Curriculum support and teacher training are equally important. An inclusive curriculum and well-prepared teachers are prerequisites for accommodating diverse learning styles. Moreover, policy support is crucial to ensure that inclusive education is not just an ideal but a practical reality. Policies must promote inclusivity, not hinder it.
           <br/>
           In conclusion, inclusive education is not an option; it is a necessity that fosters diversity, equality, and a more compassionate society. It is a path we must all tread to ensure that no child is left behind.

           (b) Title: The Impact of Sports on Children’s Cognitive Development -by Ryan Mishra, Sports Coach
           <br/>
           Engaging in sports activities goes beyond physical fitness; it significantly influences the cognitive development of children. The research underscores the profound positive effects sports have on young minds.
           <br/>
           Participating in sports enhances concentration, memory, and problem-solving abilities. The complex strategies and split-second decisions required in games stimulate cognitive functions. Furthermore, sports encourage goal-setting, discipline, and time management, fostering skills crucial for academic success.
           <br/>
           Physical activities promote the release of endorphins, which improve mood and reduce stress. Reduced stress levels positively impact cognitive processes, including information retention and analytical thinking.
           <br/>
           Team sports nurture social skills, empathy, and communication, promoting emotional intelligence. Interaction with peers and coaches aids in adapting to varying social situations.
           <br/>
           In conclusion, sports play a pivotal role in shaping children’s cognitive development. The amalgamation of physical activity, strategic thinking, and teamwork builds well-rounded individuals who excel not only in the field but also in classrooms and life.

           <br/>
           The poet glorifies the power of poetry in an attractive manner. He shows pith in his poetry and says that even time and death cannot destroy it. The beauty of his poetry is more than that of the statues and gilded monuments of princes. His poetry is imperishable.

They would be used to add color to their coat of arms, mementos, and service badges.

           We gathered at the Smiths’ home today, tears flowing freely, and the weight of our loss palpable. The elders, who had known the Smiths for decades, were deeply affected. Their feelings are a mix of sadness, nostalgia, and helplessness. They shared stories of past joys and laughter, now distant memories.
           <br/>
           This misfortune reminds us of life’s fragility. The elders, with their wisdom, know that today’s joy can become tomorrow’s sorrow. As we support each other, we’re reminded to cherish every moment and treasure the bonds with our loved ones.
           <br/>
           Heavy-hearted,
           <br/>

           Dear Frog
           <br/>
           I hope this letter finds you well. Having recently read Julius Caesar, I couldn’t help but be inspired by the profound friendship between Mark Antony and Caesar. Their unwavering loyalty and support for each other in times of triumph and adversity left a lasting impression on me.
           <br/>
           It appears that you, dear Frog, could benefit from some guidance in the values of loyalty and friendship. Just as Mark Antony stood by Caesar, I believe that fostering positive relationships is essential for your well-being and happiness.
           <br/>
           Loyalty involves being there for your friends, supporting them through thick and thin, and valuing their presence in your life. In return, true friends will stand by you when you need them most.
           <br/>
           I encourage you to consider how you can be a better friend to the Nightingale. Building a strong and genuine friendship will enrich your life and bring joy to those around you.
           <br/>
           Wishing you the best in your journey towards becoming a better friend.
           <br/>
           Yours friendly
           <br/>
           Jenna
