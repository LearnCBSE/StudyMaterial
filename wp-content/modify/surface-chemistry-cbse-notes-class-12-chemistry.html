          <h2>
           Surface Chemistry Class 12 Notes Chemistry Chapter 5
          </h2>
          <p>
           <strong>
            1.
           </strong>
           This phenomenon of attracting and retaining the molecules of a substance by a solid (or a liquid) on its surface resulting into a higher concentration of the molecules on the surface is known as
           <strong>
            adsorption.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            2.
           </strong>
           The substance that is adsorbed is called
           <strong>
            adsorbate
           </strong>
           and the substance which adsorbs is called
           <strong>
            adsorbent.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            3.
           </strong>
           <strong>
            Desorption
           </strong>
           is a process of removing an adsorbed substance from a surface on which it is adsorbed.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            4. Absorption
           </strong>
           is different from adsorption. In absorption, the substance is uniformly distributed throughout the body of a solid or a liquid.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            5.
           </strong>
           When the adsorbate is held on the surface by weak van der Waals forces, the process is called
           <strong>
            physical adsorption
           </strong>
           or
           <strong>
            physical adsorption
           </strong>
           . This type of adsorption can be reversed by heating or decreasing the pressure.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            6.
           </strong>
           When the forces holding the adsorbate on the surface are of the magnitude of chemical bond forces, the process is called
           <strong>
            chemical adsorption
           </strong>
           or
           <strong>
            chemisorption
           </strong>
           . This type of adsorption is irreversible.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            7.
           </strong>
           Adsorption is generally accompanied by evolution of heat, i.e., it is an exothermic process.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            8.
           </strong>
           The extent of adsorption of a gas on a solid depends upon the
           <strong>
            following
           </strong>
           <strong>
            factors:
           </strong>
           <br/>
           (a) Nature of the adsorbate,
           <br/>
           (b) Nature of the adsorbent,
           <br/>
           (c) Temperature, and
           <br/>
           (d) Pressure.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            9.
           </strong>
           A relation or a graph between the magnitude of adsorption x/m and the pressure P of the gas at a constant temperature is called
           <strong>
            adsorption isotherm
           </strong>
           .
           <br/>
           <strong>
            10. Freundlich adsorption isotherm:
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <img alt="Surface Chemistry Class 12 Notes Chemistry Chapter 5 img-1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-134406" height="55" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Surface-Chemistry-Class-12-Notes-Chemistry-Chapter-5-img-1.png" width="255"/>
           <br/>
           Plot of log x/m Vs log P will be a straight line with a slope of 1 In. It holds good at moderate temperature. At low pressure, n = 1.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            11. Langmuir adsorption isotherm is based on following assumptions:
           </strong>
           <br/>
           (i) Every adsorption site is equivalent in all respect.
           <br/>
           (ii) The ability of a particle to bind at a particular site is independent of whether the nearby sites are occupied or not.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            12. Langmuir derived the following relation.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <img alt="Surface Chemistry Class 12 Notes Chemistry Chapter 5 img-2" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-134407" height="67" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Surface-Chemistry-Class-12-Notes-Chemistry-Chapter-5-img-2.png" width="110"/>
           <br/>
           where a and b are Langmuir parameters.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            13.
           </strong>
           A substance that can influence the rate of a chemical reaction but itself remains unchanged chemically at the end is called a
           <strong>
            catalyst.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            14.
           </strong>
           In a homogeneous catalysis, the catalyst is present in the same phase as the reactants.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            15.
           </strong>
           In heterogeneous catalysis, the catalyst is present in a different phase than that of the reactants.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            16.
           </strong>
           Enzymes also called
           <strong>
            biological catalysts
           </strong>
           are proteins which catalyse the reactions in living systems.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            17.
           </strong>
           The colloidal solutions are intermediate between true solutions and suspensions. The diameter of colloidal particles varies from 1 to 1000 nm.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            18.
           </strong>
           A colloidal system is a heterogeneous system which consists of disperse phase and dispersion medium.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            19.
           </strong>
           The
           <strong>
            disperse phase
           </strong>
           constitutes the colloidal particles whereas the
           <strong>
            dispersion medium
           </strong>
           constitutes the medium in which the colloidal particles are dispersed.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            20.
           </strong>
           There are eight types of colloidal systems based on the disperse phase and the dispersion medium.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            21.
           </strong>
           Sols are the colloidal system in which the solid is disperse phase and the liquid is dispersion medium.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            22. Hydrosols
           </strong>
           -Colloids in water.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Alcosols
           </strong>
           – Colloids in alcohol.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            23. Lyophillic colloids
           </strong>
           (solvent loving) are those substances that directly pass into the colloidal state when brought in contact with the solvent, e.g., proteins, starch, rubber, etc.
           <br/>
           These sols are quite stable because of the strong attractive forces between the particles and the, dispersion medium.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            24.
           </strong>
           <strong>
            Lyophobic colloids
           </strong>
           (solvent hating) are those substances that do not form the colloidal sol readily when mixed with the dispersion medium. These sols are less stable than the lyophilic sols.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            25.
           </strong>
           The colloids are also classified as multimolecular, macro-molecular and associated colloids.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            26. Lyophobic sols can be prepared by the following methods:
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (a) Chemical methods:
           </strong>
           <br/>
           (i) Oxidation,
           <br/>
           (ii) Reduction,
           <br/>
           (iii) Hydrolysis ,
           <br/>
           (iv) Double decomposition,
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (b) Physical methods:
           </strong>
           <br/>
           (i) Exchange of solvent:
           <br/>
           (ii) Excessive cooling: A colloidal sol of ice in an organic solvent (CHCl
           <sub>
            3
           </sub>
           or ether) can be obtained by freezing a solution of water in the solvent.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (c) Dispersion methods:
           </strong>
           <br/>
           (i) Mechanical dispersion:
           <br/>
           (ii) Bredig’s arc method:
           <br/>
           (iii) Peptization method:
           <br/>
           <strong>
            27. Lyophilic sols
           </strong>
           are readily prepared by warming the substance with a dispersion medium, e.g., starch, gelatin, gumarabic, etc., are easily brought into the colloidal state by warming with water.
           <br/>
           28. The process of separating a soluble crystalloid from a colloid is called dialysis.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            29. Characteristics of colloidal solution:
           </strong>
           <br/>
           (a) The zig-zag and random motion of the colloidal particles is called
           <strong>
            Brownian movement
           </strong>
           .
           <br/>
           (b) When a beam of light is passed through a colloidal solution, its path becomes visible.
           <br/>
           This phenomenon is known as Tyndall effect.
           <br/>
           It is due to the scattering of light by colloidal particles.
           <br/>
           (c) This movement of colloidal particles under applied electric field is known as
           <br/>
           electrophoresis.
           <br/>
           (d) Diffusion of colloidal particles takes place from a region of higher concentration to lower concentration.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            30. Emulsions:
           </strong>
           It is a colloidal system in which both the dispersed phase and the dispersion medium are liquids, e.g., milk consists of small drops of liquid fat dispersed in water.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            31. Emulsification
           </strong>
           is the process of making an emulsion.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            32. Types of Emulsions
           </strong>
           <br/>
           (a) Oil-in-water type in which small droplets of an oil are dispersed in water, e.g., milk, cod- liver oil, etc.
           <br/>
           (b) Water-in-oil type in which water droplets are
           <br/>
           dispersed in an oil medium, e.g., butter.
