           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below:
           <br/>
           1. When we think of the game of cricket, we come to the conclusion that it is primarily a game that depends on outstanding physical activities, good hand-eye co-ordination, speed, skill and strength. It provides entertainment and generates strong feelings of excitement. A good match of cricket or of any other game neither adds to the existing stock of human knowledge nor reveals any secret of existence. It does not carry any deep meaning but most people, particularly the lover of sports attach deep emotions and numerous meanings to it. Games are thought of as a metaphor for life. They are supposed to teach many lessons. In fact, more is said and written about a cricket match than about scientific findings or great philosophy.
          </p>
          <p>
           2. This is’because games, like a morality play, in which settings and rules are made by us, can easily make people test their fair and foul conduct, principles of reward and punishment, and emotions of joy and disappointment. They can make us experience the thrill of war without exposing us to its dangers. A man watching a cricket match on T.V. and munching popcorn is like a surrogate warrior. In fact, games provide us with a safe outlet for our aggressiveness. If games become aggressive, they lose the very purpose of providing entertainment and purging us of our aggressiveness. They can calm our impatience without creating any conflict.
          </p>
          <p>
           3. Commentators, Journalists Politicians and Analysts can do a great favour to the competing teams by keeping the excitement within limits. The teams should play without being dominated by feelings of national honour and shame. Excellent performance of the players of both teams should be enjoyed and appreciated.
           <br/>
           Winning or losing in a game should not be taken seriously. A game is fun if it is played with true spirit of sportsmanship.

           1. How bird hits happen, why they are a concern?
           <br/>
           New Delhi, June 20
           <br/>
           At least two bird strike incidents happened on Sunday. Both aircrafts returned to their airports of origin and were grounded for maintenance. An ABC aircraft which took off from Guwahati towards Delhi, suffered damage to its left engine following a bird hit at 1600 feet. The pilots returned to Guwahati. The other strike happened on another flight from Patna to Delhi. The pilots of the aircraft suspected a bird strike during the take-off roll but continued to climb. Following the take off rotation, they were informed by the cabin crew of sparks emanating from the left engine. Subsequently, the pilots were also informed by air traffic control of smoke coming out of one of the engines. The pilots declared an emergency and returned to Patna.
          </p>
          <p>
           2. Why are bird strikes a concern?
           <br/>
           Bird strikes are among the most common threats to aircraft safety, and they typically occur during take-off or landing. Dozens of bird-strikes happen each day but some can be more dangerous than others. Typically, when birds collide with an aircraft’s airframe it is unlikely to cause significant problems for the pilots flying. But there are instances when the aircraft engine ingests the birds. This can lead to a loss of thrust for the engine and cause maneuverability problems for the crew. In these cases, where a jet engine ingests a bird, procedures would generally call for pilots to land the plane at the closest airport. While most airframe bird strikes are not considered critical to air safety, if a collision cracks a window or a wind screen, pilots will look to land as early as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
           3. How critical are bird strikes to air safety?
           <br/>
           Smaller planes would generally be more susceptible to the dangers of bird strikes than larger ones. However, given that bird strikes mostly happen during take-off and landing, these incidents could distract the pilots during what are highly critical phases of flights that demand the complete attention of the crew.
          </p>
          <p>
           4. What causes bird-strikes?
           <br/>
           The presence of birds around an aircraft increases the chances of a bird strike. In the monsoon, as water puddles emerge on open grounds attracting insects to breed, the presence of birds increases. In some cases, bird hits also happen at higher altitudes when a plane is cruising. These are more dangerous than the low-altitude hits, given that they can cause rapid depressurization of cabins. Other reasons for bird activity around the air field could be presence of landfills or vtaste disposal sites that can attract a large number of birds.
           <br/>
           (i) Does the following statement agree with the information given in Paragraph 1.
           <br/>
           When an airplane is hit by a bird or is suspected to have been hit, the passengers must be asked to get down at once.
           <br/>
           Select from the following:
           <br/>
           True: If the statement agrees with the information.
           <br/>
           False: If the statement contradicts the information.
           <br/>
           Not Given: If there is no information on this.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Not Given : If there is no information on this.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Select the option that displays the most likely reason for Bird hits.
           <br/>
           (a) when the aircraft is overloaded
           <br/>
           (b) at the time of landing or taking off
           <br/>
           (c) when the crew become negligent
           <br/>

           <br/>
           Sir
           <br/>
           Through the medium of the columns of your esteemed newspaper I would like to reiterate the , need to keep our surroundings clean to avoid outbreak of common diseases like malaria and dengue.
           <br/>
           With the advent of the monsoon season mosquito breeding multiplies manifold and leads to outbreak of malaria and dengue. These diseases are dangerous and we must ensure to take preventive measures to minimise their spread. If we clean the dumped waste and remove water holding containers in and around our homes we can reduce the breeding areas of these disease carrying mosquitoes. To protect ourselves from dengue and malaria we should avoid exposing our skin, apply mosquito repellents and sleep under mosquito nets.
           <br/>
           Though awareness about how outbreak of malaria and dengue can be controlled is known well, my purpose of writing this letter is to reiterate the need to keep ourselves safe and our surroundings clean.
           <br/>

           (a) SPIRIT OF COMMUNITY
           <br/>

           It is heartening to see senior residents of our ABC colony teaching children of the neighbouring slums. I have been observing this commendable spirit of giving back to the community by the senior residents every Sunday morning.
           <br/>
           This spirit of community initiative has become tenuous. Very few people devote their time to an act of selfless service. Community initiative is to be a part of some kind of fundraising. One can also help with animal shelters or join groups for clean-up drives. Community initiative is also a form of those activities, plans and agendas that are executed for the welfare of the under-privileged sections of society and for empowering their lives.
           <br/>
           This endeavour of Our Senior Citizens has become the beacon of hope which is enlightening spirit of community in one and all.

           (b) PROBLEM OF STRAY DOGS
           <br/>
           By: Prerna
           <br/>
           Dogs have a unique relation with us —one of Companionship. This poses a moral dilemma of being responsible for their welfare on the one hand, and confronting the unpredictability of their evolution from the family of wolves on the other.
           <br/>
           Stray dogs, in several instances, are a menace in public places. Some of them are aggressive, wild and uncontrollable in their behaviour. Their barking and howling are a nuisance to the community. They litter streets by overturning dustbins and they are the most common carriers of rabies, which is a fatal disease. To overcome the menace of stray dogs it is important to reduce their number by sterilising them. Dog lovers should be encouraged to embrace stray dogs.
           <br/>
           Ultimately, the responsibility of ensuring that the menace caused by stray dogs is dealt with effectively is on us and we need to take this problem seriously.

           Answer any TWO of the following in about 40-50 words: [2 × 2 = 4]
           <br/>
           (a) Describe Gondwana.
           <br/>
           (b) Do you agree with the Tiger King’s statement? You may kill even a cow in self defence.
           <br/>
           (c) What extraordinary experience did Charley have when he went to the Grand station?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Gondwana was a giant amalgamated southern supercontinent that existed six hundred and fifty million years ago. It was centred roughly around the present day Antarctica. It thrived for 500 million years but later the landmass was forced to separate into countries, shaping the globe as it is known today.

           Question 12.
           <br/>
           Answer any ONE of the following in about 120-150 words:
           <br/>
           (a) ‘Last Spring’ and ‘Indigo’ bring out how the common man is a victim of exploitation Explain. [5]
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (b) ‘Aunt Jennifer’s Tigers’ and ‘A Thing of Beauty’, can be read together to show the permanence and everlasting impact of art and of things of beauty. Comment. 5
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) ‘Lost Spring’ and ‘Indigo’ bring out how the common man is a victim of exploitation. Anees Jung vividly highlights the miserable life of street children and the bangle makers of Firozabad. Through her encounter with children from deprived backgrounds, the author describes how Saheb and Mukesh live in impoverished conditions and are forced into child labour and denied the opportunity of going to school. Likewise the poor sharecroppers of Champaran are exploited by the British landlords. The peasants were fear-stricken and did not have the courage to stand up for their own rights. The exploitation of the indigo sharecroppers at the hands of the British was during the pre-independence era. The bangle-makers and the slum-children is an instance of exploitation of unorganised labour and children even after independence.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (b) ‘Aunt Jennifer’s Tigers’ and ‘A Thing of Beauty’ show the everlasting impact of art and things of beauty respectively. Both art and beautiful things leave their permanent imprint on our mind. When we see objects of beauty we feel happy and the lasting impression that things of beauty leave on our mind continue to give us joy even after we cannot see them. Proximity to and appreciating beautiful objects is like God Who has bestowed these things of beauty upon mankind as a gift so that we can derive pleasure from them. Similarly, the objects of art created by Aunt Jennifer enable her to feel a sense of triumph as she rebels against her oppressed life through the majestic beasts that she has created. They are symbols of bravery and courage and of Aunt Jennifer’s desire for freedom.

           Answer any ONE of the following in about 120-150 words:
           <br/>
           (a) After seeing off the enemy soldier, Dr. Sadao must have felt relieved. He was able to uphold the oath that he had taken as a doctor. Dr. Sadao made an entry into his daily diary explaining the dilemma faced by him and how he resolved it.
           <br/>
           Imagine yourself to be Dr. Sadao and express his thoughts.
           <br/>
           (You may begin like this: I was able to uphold the oath that I had taken as a doctor….) [5]
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (b) Both Bama and Zitkala-Sa were from marginalised communities. They challenged the system to bring dignity into their lives. Justify. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) 22nd September, 20xx
           <br/>
           I was able to uphold the oath that I had taken as a doctor and also fulfil my duty towards my country. The American soldier was wounded and in a pitiable condition. As a doctor I was under oath to save the life of a dying man. But he was from the enemy’s camp. My loyalty towards my country was conflicting with my professional ethics. Now, I finally feel relieved that I was able to strike a balance between my commitment towards humanity and my duty towards my country. I operated upon the soldier, tended him and then revealed the truth about his presence in my house to the General. He was not able to keep up to his commitment so I had no choice but to help the soldier to escape as his presence in my house was getting too problematic for me and my family.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (b) Bama and Zitkala-Sa belonged to marginalised communities. Zitkala-Sa was an American Indian woman who was ill-treated by the whites who adopted force and oppression to compel the natives to shed their age old customs and traditions. The worst indignity she suffered was the cutting of her long hair. Her long and beautiful hair was cut after she was dragged out. She cried and resisted by kicking and scratching wildly as she was tied fast in a chair but still she did not submit. No one came to help her or to console her. Bama, who belonged to a Dalit community was a victim of the caste system. She was upset by the inhuman attitude of the people belonging to the ‘higher’ caste towards the ‘lower’ caste.
          </p>
          <p>
           She had experienced the evils of untouchability when she was studying in the third standard. Both these women fought and struggled against exploitation and oppression. Zitkala-Sa does not submit but struggles when her hair is being shingled. She fights till she is overpowered. Bama fights against the evils of untouchability in her own way. She works hard and stands first in her class. People then come to her of their own accord.

           <br/>
           Sir
           <br/>
           Through the medium of the columns of your esteemed newspaper I wish to bring to the notice of one and all the dismal condition of the parks in our colony and also suggest ways of maintaining them.
           <br/>
           During my morning walks I have noticed that the two parks of Colony Pranihar are in a dismal condition. The reasons for the neglect of these parks are unpruned trees, no dustbins, stray dogs making them dirty and lack of security. It is my request to the concerned authorities to take up measures for improving these parks by regular maintenance. The trees should be pruned, broken benches should be removed and the broken fence should be repaired. Waste bins should be installed and security should be tightened.
           <br/>
           I hope you will publish my letter so that the concerned authorities take up steps to improve the condition of the parks by regular maintenance.
           <br/>

           (b) HAZARDS OF ENVIRONMENT POLLUTION
           <br/>
           By: Praveen (Sercretary, Eco-Club)

           Bharati School, Lucknow
           <br/>
           Our environment forms an important aspect of our life because this is where we find the essentials of life like air, food and water. But industrialisation and modernisation have led to environment pollution.
           <br/>
           Environmental pollution is wherein the natural resources are damaged by the presence of harmful factors which have the potential to cause imbalance and create hazards for living beings. Various factors have contributed to environment pollution.
          </p>
          <p>
           These include dumping of industrial waste in water bodies, improper disposal of e-waste and medical waste, indiscriminate felling of trees and construction to name a few. This problem of environment pollution needs stricter laws to be introduced and implemented. Media can play an important role in spreading awareness. NGOs should also take initiative to make people understand the imperative need to take up steps to control pollution of the environment. The industrial development, technological advancement and ever-increasing human population have led to environmental pollution that requires immediate remedial strategies.

           Question 11.
           <br/>
           Answer any TWO of the following in 40-50 words each: [2 × 2 = 4]
           <br/>
           (a) What prevented the Shokalskiy from going further? What did the captain instruct the passengers to do? (Journey to the End of The Earth)
           <br/>
           (b) What did the Maharaja and dewan do to avoid the danger of losing the throne?
           <br/>
           (c) What did Judewin tell the narrator? What was the effect?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The Shokalskiy had managed to wedge herself into a thick white stretch of ice between the Peninsula and Tadpole island which prevented it from going any further. The Captain decided to turn around and head back north, but before that he instructed the passengers to climb down the gangplank and walk on the ocean.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) After holding deliberations over the issue with the Dewan, the Maharaja ordered expensive • diamond rings which were sent to the wife of the British officer. The Maharaja and the Dewan expected her to choose one or two rings and send the rest back. But she kept all the rings for which the Maharaja had to pay three lakh rupees. Though he lost the money, the Maharaja managed to retain his kingdom.
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) Judewin gave the narrator a terrible warning. She knew a few words of English and told the narrator that she had overheard the paleface woman. She was talking about cutting their long hair. They discussed their fate and then Judewin said that they would have to submit because those people were strong. But Zitkala-Sa refused to submit and said that she would struggle first.

           Subject: Consumerism and its consequences
           <br/>
           Sir
           <br/>
           Through the medium of the columns of your esteemed newspaper I would like to express my views to make the readers aware on the consequences of the increasing consumerism which people are finding difficult to resist.
           <br/>
           The newspapers today have full page advertisements promoting luxury items which people are unable to resist buying. Soon they find themselves trapped in a world of social one- upmanship and living beyond budgets. Consumerism has created an entire culture around buying and valuing people as per their ownership of material goods. The biggest problem with consumerism is the fact that people do not realize that there is a problem. We need to consider solutions to control this habit. Media can play a responsible role in helping to control this problem. Print media and electronic media can be used to make people aware about the evils of consumerism.
           <br/>
           I hope you will publish my letter in your esteemed newspaper so that people understand the need to resist consumerism and live within their budgets.
           <br/>

           (a) ADVANTAGES OF EDUCATING THE GIRL CHILD
           <br/>
           By: Nishi (Social Woker)
           <br/>
           Education of girls has been a high priority with the Government of India. In the new millennium India has consolidated its earlier educational reforms with increased resources and stronger policy commitments for achieving elementary education, particularly for girls. Reaching out , to the girl child is primary to the efforts to universalise elementary education. Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan or Education For All programme recognizes that ensuring the education of the girl¬’: child requires changes not only in the education system but also in the society’s norms and attitude. A two-pronged gender strategy has hence been adopted to make the educational system responsive to the needs of the girls through targeted interventions which serve as a pull-factor to enhance access and retention of girls in schools on the one hand and generate a community demand for girls’ education through training and mobilisation on the other.
           <br/>
           The CBSE has also come lip with the novel scheme of providing free education from sixth standard onwprds to the single girl child. The need of the times is that the government should further ‘ improve the educational infrastructure and make it more accessible and meaningful for the girl child. There is no doubt that the progress and advancement of India can be enhanced by educating the girl child. When girls are educated’fhey are able to lead a productive life and participate in decisions that affect them. They also become financially independent and are thus able to build a better future for themselves and their families.

           <br/>
           By: Rishi (Student Reporter)
           <br/>
           Our school organised a seminar on Cyber Bullying and Online safety on 18th July, 20xx in our school auditorium from 10 A.M. to 2 P.M. It was attended by counsellors and students from ten different schools. The Seminar was conducted in two phases wherein eminent speakers like Dr. Rao, Dr. Sen and Dr. Sidh interacted with the students about the ethics and rules of using social media. They then introduced the students to terminologies like Cyber Bullying, Data Theft, Digital Frauds etc. The seminar was concluded in the second phase by discussing the perils of Cyber bullying and the measures that can be taken to control it and how to get legal aid, if required. The students found this interactive session with the experts very interesting and informative. Our Principal ended the seminar by proposing the vote of thanks to the esteemed guests.

           Question 11.
           <br/>
           Answer any TWO of the following in about 40-50 words: [2 × 2 = 4]
           <br/>
           (a) How did Zitkala-Sa try to save her long hair?
           <br/>
           (b) What did the Maharaja do to realize his ambition of killing hundred tigers?
           <br/>
           (c) What did Geoff Green switch over to ? Why? (Journey to the End of the Earth)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) When Zitkala-Sa’s friend Judewin told her that her hair was going to be cut Zitkala-Sa told her that she would not submit but would put up a struggle. First she crawled and hid under a bed inside a large room. When she was dragged out she resisted by kicking and scratching wildly. Even when she was tied fast in a chair, she cried aloud, shaking her head all the while.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) To realize his ambition of killing hundred tigers the Maharaja banned tiger hunting in his state by anyone except himself. He vowed that he would attend to all other matters only after killing the hundred tigers. When the tiger population in his state became extinct, the Maharaja married a girl from a state which possessed a large number of tigers and thereafter he killed five or six tigers each time he visited his father-in-law.
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) Geoff Green got tired of carting celebrities and retired, rich, curiosity seekers who could only ‘give’ back in a limited way. With Students on Ice programme, he offers the future generation of policy-makers a life-changing experience at an age when they are ready to absorb, learn and most importantly, act.
