            1. Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follow: [10]
           </span>
          </p>
          <p>
           1. We are what we eat. The type of food we eat has both immediate and long-term effects on us, at all the three levels-the body, the mind and the spirit. Food which is tamasik (i.e., stale or leftover) in nature is bound to generate stress as it tends to upset the normal functioning of the human body. Fresheners should be avoided. Taking piping hot tea/milk or steaming hot food, whenever available, must be preferred.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           Excessive use of condiments also disturbs one’s usually calm attitude. Further, it is a mistaken belief that smoking or drinking, even in moderation, relieves stress. Simple meals with one or two food items, rather than too many lavish dishes, are advisable. Also, vegetarian diet is preferable. Although it is customary to serve fruits with food items, it is not the right thing to do.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is because different kinds of digestive secretions are produced by the stomach for variant food items. Mixing up too many varieties of food items in one meal creates problems for the digestive system. In fact, any one type of fruit, preferably taken in the morning, is better.
          </p>

          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           2. On an average, we eat almost three to four times the quantity of food than we actually need. A lot of body’s energy is used up for digesting the excess food. It is said that after a particular level of food intake, the ‘food actually eats one up’.
          </p>
          <p>
           3. It is always good to eat a little less than your ‘full-stomach’ capacity. Besides, never eat food unless you are really hungry. To have dinner at 8 or 9 p.m. after a heavy snack around 5 or 6 p.m. in the evening is asking for trouble. In fact, skipping a meal is always good if the stomach is upset. There are varying views on the benefits of fasting, but we will not discuss them here. However, giving a break to one’s stomach, at least once a week, by having only fruit or milk, etc., may be worth a try.
          </p>
          <p>
           4. While a little bit of water taken with meals is all right, drinking 30 to 60 ml of water with food is not advisable. Water, taken an hour or so before or after meals, is good for digestion. One’s diet must be balanced with all the required nutrients for a healthy living.
          </p>
          <p>
           5. Also remember, excess of everything is bad. Related to the problem of stress, excessive intake of salt is definitely out. Too much of sugar, fried food and chilies are not good either. Over-indulgence and excessive craving for a particular taste/type of food generates rajasik (aggressive) or at worst, tamasik (dull) tendencies. An even more important aspect of the relationship between food and stress lies not so much in what or how much we eat but how the food is taken.
          </p>
          <p>
           For example, food eaten in great hurry or in a state of anger or any other negative state of mind is bound to induce stress. How the food is served is also very important. Not only the presentation, cutlery, crockery, etc., play a role, the love and affection with which the food is served is also significant. Finding faults with food while it is being eaten is a bad habit. It is better not to eat the food you do not like, rather than finding faults with it.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           6. It is good to have regular food habits. Workaholics who do not find time to eat food at proper meal time invite stomach ulcers. One must try to enjoy one’s food, and therefore, eating at the so-called lunch/dinner meetings is highly inadvisable. Every morsel of food should be enjoyed with a totally peaceful state of mind. Food and discussions should not be mixed. There are accepted ways to ‘charge’ the food we eat. Prayer is perhaps ‘the best method for energising the food and it does definite additional good at no extra cost. By: Lt. Gen. M. M. Walia

           The Marathon of the Sands
           <br/>
           The Marathon des Sables, or ‘Marathon of the Sands’, which takes place in the Sahara Desert, has gained a reputation as the ‘toughest footrace on Earth’ since it began in 1986 with 186 competitors. Runners have to complete 250 kilometres in 6 days in one of the most challenging environments on the planet.
          </p>
          <p>
           The event has 1,400 entries, with a support team of 400, and 200 members of the media are also involved in it this year. The race attracts runners from all over the world, and Moroccan runners have been particularly successful. Irishman Ben Turner, who is 71, is hoping to become the race’s oldest finisher ever. In order to prepare for the race, he has spent the last month training in a hotter climate in Spain.
          </p>
          <p>
           For most runners, it is not about winning but about finishing the race and receiving the famous kiss on each cheek from Patrick Bauer, the man who originally set up the race. The rules state that competitors must be able to rely on themselves: organisers provide everyone with water, but individual competitors are free to choose their own food items.
          </p>
          <p>
           There are strict rules about the weight of the items that competitors take with them. Equipment must weigh between 6.5 and 15 kilograms, and though tents are supplied, runners need to bring lightweight sleeping bags. Most runners aim for the lower end of the weight range, as it decreases the effort they need to put in during the race.

           “I was happy to give up the luxury of a small stove to warm my food/’ he says. “The only time I don’t have music playing to keep me going is when I’m doing the special hot yoga classes to help me prepare for the desert.” The temperatures in the Sahara Desert are very high during the day, but sink to freezing at night.

           For another runner, Jordan Smith, recreating these conditioris in the UK is a challenge – particularly in the British winter. Jordan knows that he cannot prepare for the heat and sun, so he ensures that he runs an average of one hundred kilometres a week, which has helped him to improve his strength. Although Jordan has been preparing for the event for a year, his biggest fear is the thought of not finishing, rather than the more common concern of being stung by a scorpion. On the basis of your reading the passage, answer the questions that follow.

            3. Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follows :
           </span>
          </p>
          <p>
           1. In life, you’ll always come across situations where there will be someone else who’s better than you, especially when there is no one quality or standard that people can be judged on. There will always be someone who looks better, has more money or is more intelligent than you. How you choose to approach these situations, of course, depends on the perspective you take. People in themselves aren’t intimidating, it’s the opinions you form about them that make you feel so. Rather than judging people on a single attribute and getting intimidated, be comfortable with who you are and approach other people as complete individuals rather than a bundle of good or bad attributes.
          </p>
          <p>
           2. The key to not letting others intimidate you is to know your own worth. Don’t let your sense of if be defined by what others think of you or how you compare yourself to them. Know what you are and be comfortable in your skin. Instead of feeling threatened and letting your ego in the way, you could benefit a great deal by being around people who might be better than you in some ways. Respect others for what they are and use these opportunities to learn from the strengths and virtues of others.
          </p>
          <p>
           3. Don’t get bogged down by what you don’t have or can’t do. We all have limitations. Learn to accept them and focus on your strengths. A lot of times, we come under pressure from what people we believe to be more popular and influential than us, in a bid to fit in with them. However, at times like these, it’s important for you to stay true to yourself and say ‘no’ when you’re expected to do something that makes you uncomfortable.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
           4. Your first response to an intimidating person or situation would probably be to avoid them altogether. However, avoidance only goes on to increase your anxiety. Confront these situations head on, with more and more practice, you’ll start finding these situations easier to deal with. Always keep in mind that everybody has flaws and everyone has his/her own share of struggles, even if you aren’t able to spot them. Our selfesteem gets lowered when we focus too much on our weaknesses and neglect what we get right. Change this pattern and start giving yourself credit for your strengths and successes.

           <br/>
           The passage emphasizes the importance of having the right approach to life. The right perspective makes situations better. There is no set quality or standard to judge people. It is the perspective that matters. We must learn to be comfortable with what we have. For that one should first know one’s worth, sense of self and one’s comfort zone. Learning to be fearless or keeping ego away also helps a lot. One must avail the opportunities present around and should learn to accept the strengths and limitations.

           “Better keep yourself clean and bright; you are the window through which you must see the world.” – (G.B. Shaw).
           <br/>
           An old proverb says, “Cleanliness is next to Godliness.” This means that cleanliness comes next to Godliness in importance. Good morning to one and all present. Today girVboy of XI B, got the golden opportunity to express his/her views on the topic ‘Cleanliness is next to Godliness’.
          </p>
          <p>
           Cleanliness of the body is necessary for physical health. Dirt and disease go together. Disease causing germs breed and thrive in dirt; and the epidemic diseases which sweep over a country and carry off thousands, are generally the results of the dirty habits and surroundings of the people. Not only the regular washing of hands and face, but the frequent and thorough bathing of the whole body, and wearing clean clothes, are conditions of good health.
          </p>
          <p>
           To keep our house and neighbourhood clean is our utmost obligation as it is the only remedy available for national health and hygiene. Dirt and refuse are the causes of sickness and suffering, which ultimately give rise to diseases and epidemics. Plagues and epidemics that set in are caused by filthy and insanitary hygienic conditions. So, it is a prime duty of every citizen to ensure that public places and our surroundings are not littered.

           A great percentage of our population lives below the poverty line. Slums in metropolitan areas are inhabited by these poor people, most of them have migrated from villages. Unable to earn a decent means of living, they live in huts having no proper sanitation or drinking water. The uneducated people need to be instructed in civic and clean surroundings. Cleanliness of body leads to the cleanliness of mind, and thereby to the soul.

           Raghav, a student of class XI, has been asked to make a speech on the “Ill-effects of watching too much Television”. Write out the speech in 120-150 words.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Effects of Watching too much Television
           <br/>
           Good Morning respected Principal, teachers and my fellow students. Today I, Raghav of class XI, will speak about the ill-effects of excessive television viewing. Nowadays watching too much TV has become a very widespread problem.
          </p>
          <p>
           We can see a TV in every home, even the parents begin to teach their children to watch TV from early childhood, because they think that it is a good way to develop a child. Sometimes people forget that the TV does not always carry only positive aspects. Negative effects of the TV have become quite an obvious fact. As a consequence, TV affects human physical, mental and social health in a very destructive manner.
          </p>
          <p>
           One reason why people should not watch too much TV is the reduction of mental capacity. Because when people watch an excessive amount of television they do not look for new solutions for any problems. As another reason, excessive TV watching leads to emotional frustration in families and problems with relatives. Also watching too much TV is harmful because the human brain is filled with redundant information.
          </p>
          <p>
           A huge stream of advertising, TV shows, TV series and news releases emotionally cripple a person. Thus, it can be said that in the modern times watching TV is an attribute of a limited world view and lazy lifestyle, which leads to many psychological and physiological problems.
           <br/>
           Thank you
          </p>

           Question 9.
           <br/>
           You are Kamakshi/Kuber. You have been selected to represent your school in an All India School Debate Competition organised by the Rotary Club, Bengaluru (South). The topic for the debate is : In the opinion of this house, value- based education is the only remedy for decreasing crime rate amongst the educated folk.’ Write a debate in not more than 120-150 words For or Against the motion, giving arguments for your stands.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Today I, Kuber of class XI, have got the golden opportunity to express my views for the motion, ‘Value based education is the only remedy for decreasing the crime rate.’ Hon’ble Chairman, Respected Judges and Dear Friends! There can’t be two opinions on the fact that ‘value-based education is the only remedy for decreasing crime rate amoñg the educated folk.’ Sir, there is no doubt that education has been made compulsory up to the secondary level in India. However, value based education to all still remains a distant dream.
          </p>
          <p>
           Education has been practically reduced to the job of providing degrees. These degrees do help them in getting jobs in the market. However, our education system doesn’t help young men and ladies to build up their characters and morals. The result is disastrous. Our schools, colleges and universities are producing a huge army of irresponsible and uncivilised young brutes. Crime among the educated young men have been rising at an alarming rate. Robberies, chain-snatching, eve-teasing and thefts haven’t remained the monopoly of professional uneducated criminals anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
           Many educated young men have joined their ranks. Sir, the need of the hour is for value-based education. Moral education should be made a compulsory subject in all schools. Nationalism, patriotism, devotion and dedication to our country and its people, should be the guiding principles of our education system. Only a comprehensive and value-based education can help in the character building, moral and spiritual upliftment of the educated folk. It will certainly bring down the crime rate in them. Thank you.
           <br/>
           Respected Judges and Teachers.

           “Private cars should be banned in the congested commercial areas of the cities.” Write a debate in 120-150 words either for or against the motion.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Private Cars should be Banned
           <br/>
           Today, I stand before you to present my views for the motion on the topic Private cars should be banned in the congested commercial areas of the cities’. There is no end to the number of vehicles being driven around the city each day. Traffic jams have become a rather common problem and have only increased in the last 10 years. In my opinion, allowing private cars in congested commercial areas only adds to the problem.
          </p>
          <p>
           Long traffic jams do not only mean consumption of extra fuel but also more number of people suffering from respiratory diseases due to pollution. I strongly feel if people take public transport to work or hire a cab or car-pool and drive vehicles which run on CNC, the problem of constantly rising pollution and heavy traffic jams can be reduced drastically.

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Read the following extract and answer the questions that follow. (1×3=3)
           <br/>
           A. The sea holiday was her past, mine is her laughter.
           <br/>
           Both wry
           <br/>
           With the laboured ease of loss.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Why are ‘both wry’?
           <br/>
           (A) Both were happy moments which cannot be relived.
           <br/>
           (B) Both poet’s mother and her cousin were dead.
           <br/>
           (C) Both photograph and cardboard were torn.
           <br/>
           (D) Both poet and her mother were not talking to each other.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           1. Option (A) is correct.
           <br/>
           Explanation: The word ‘wry” means “twisted’ or “ironic.” In the context of the poem, the word is used to describe the fact that both the sea holiday and the poet’s mother’s laughter are now gone, and can never be relived. This is a wry observation because, while the sea holiday and the laughter were both happy moments, they are now also moments of loss.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Which figure of speech is used in ‘laboured ease of loss’?
           <br/>
           (A) Alliteration
           <br/>
           (B) Transferred Epithet
           <br/>
           (C) Personification
           <br/>
           (D) Oxymoron
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Option (D) is correct.
           <br/>
           Explanation: The figure of speech used in “laboured ease of loss” is oxymoron. Oxymoron is a figure of speech that juxtaposes two contradictory terms. In this case, the terms “laboured” and “ease” are contradictory. The word “laboured” means “difficult” or “effortful$ while the word “ease” means “comfort” or “freedom from effort.” The oxymoron “laboured ease” is used to describe the way that the poet feels about the loss of her mother’s laughter. The laughter is gone, but the poet still feels the pain of loss.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Who is ‘her’ in the above lines?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           ‘Her’ is poet’s mother who is no more.
           <br/>
           Explanation: The word “her” in the above lines refers to the poet’s mother. The poet is saying that the sea holiday was her mother’s past, and her mother’s laughter is now hers. This is because the poet now remembers the sea holiday and the laughter, and they are now a part of her own past.
           <br/>

          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Which concepts are not found in geography books ?
           <br/>
           (A) Gravity
           <br/>
           (B) Force
           <br/>
           (C) Hell and Heaven
           <br/>
           (D) Constellations
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Option (C) is correct.
           <br/>
           Explanation: The concepts that are not found in geography books are Hell and Heaven. Geography is the study of the physical features of the Earth, and it does not deal with concepts such as Hell and Heaven, which are religious or spiritual in nature.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           What is ‘that day’ in the poem?
           <br/>
           (A) The day poet loses his book.
           <br/>
           (B) The day poet loses his pencil.
           <br/>
           (C) The day poet loses his car.
           <br/>
           (D) The day poet loses his childhood.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Option (D) is correct.
           <br/>
           Explanation: The “that da in the poem is the day the poet realized that Hell and Heaven could not be found in geography books, and therefore, could not be. This was a significant day for the poet, as it marked the loss of his childhood faith in these concepts.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Find the word in the extract which means ‘comprehend’.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           realised
           <br/>
           Explanation: The word in the extract that means “comprehend” is “realised”. The word “realised” means “understood” or ‘became aware of’. In the context of the poem, the word “realised” is used to describe the poet’s understanding that Hell and Heaven could not be found in geography books.
          </p>
          <p>

           As the speaker grew mature, he acquired reasoning power. He realised that Hell and Heaven could not be found in Geography books or Atlas. Since they could not be located anywhere in the world map, he concluded that they did not exist. He would believe only what he could see and find.

           How does the rain describe herself in the poem ‘The Voice of the Rain
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The rain calls itself the poem of earth. It is everlasting and perpetual. It is something that cannot be touched. It originates from the land and the deep sea. Then it rises upward to heaven where it changes its forms into a cloud, yet remains the same in quality. From the sky it pours down on earth to wash the dry thin particles and dust layers of the earth. The rain helps the unborn seeds to sprout. These seeds lay hidden and unborn under the layer of earth. Rain gives back life to its origin making it pure and beautiful.

           Describe the narrator’s second visit to Mrs. Dorling’s house.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The narrator’s first visit to Mrs. Dorling’s house was ‘n vain. She decided to try for a second time. This time a girl of about fifteen opened the door to her. Her mother was not at home. The narrator said that she would wait for her. Following the girl along the passage, the narrator saw their old fashioned iron candle-holder hanging next to a mirror. The girl made her sit in the living room and went inside.
          </p>
          <p>
           The narrator was horrified to find herself in a room she knew and did not know. She found herself in the midst of familiar things which she longed to see again but which oppressed her in the strange atmosphere. She dared not look around her.
          </p>
          <p>
           The woollen table cloth, the cups, the white tea-pot, the spoons, the pewter plate, everything was full of memories of her former life. Suddenly the objects linked with her former life lost their value in strange surroundings. They too appeared strange to her. She no longer had the desire to possess them. She got up, walked to the door and left the house.

           Throw light on Mrs. Fitzgerald’s efforts to reform Mrs. Pearson’s family.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Mrs. Pearson does not have the courage to stand up for her rights. Therefore, Mrs. Fitzgerald suggests a novel approach— exchange of personalities. Now, as Mrs. Pearson, with the personality of Mrs. Fitzgerald, she puts the plan of formation in action. She smokes, drinks and plays cards. All this is unusual for the family She further shocks them by being tough with them in words and action.
          </p>
          <p>
           She asks them to look after themselves. She clearly tells them that she has already worked for more than eight hours that day. She tells them plainly how they behave at home and work place. She is equally blunt with Mt George Pearson, who goes away every evening to the club, leaving his wife alone at home.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
           She reveals to him how the people at club make fun of him. In short, she makes them realise their responsibility toward the mother. In the end she performs the exchange of personalities once again. Thus, Mrs. Fitzerald makes the family members of Mrs. Pearson learn that she deserves respect and responsible behaviour from them.
