           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           I think friends are really important because they make our lives happier and more fun. Friends are there to share our joys and help us when we are sad. They make us laugh and play with us, so we never feel lonely.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           When I’m with my friends, we do a lot of different things. Sometimes we play games like hide and seek or tag, and other times we just talk and share stories. We also help each other with homework and projects, which makes studying a lot more enjoyable. During breaks, we like to draw, sing songs, or even make up little plays.
          </p>
          <p>
           When I’m with my friends, I feel happy and relaxed. It’s like having a team of people who understand me and make everything better. We trust each other and can be ourselves without worrying about being judged. Having friends makes every day brighter and more exciting.

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           The title of the chapter is ‘The Unlikely Best Friends’.
           <br/>
           (a) What can be the meaning of ‘unlikely’? Discuss in groups, and then discuss with your teacher.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The word “unlikely” means something that is not expected to happen or is not probable. It suggests a situation or relationship that is surprising or unusual. In the context of friendships, “unlikely” best friends are people who, at first glance, seem too different to get along or have a close bond. They might have different backgrounds, interests, or personalities, but despite these differences, they form a strong friendship.
          </p>
          <p>
           <img alt="NCERT Class 6 English Poorvi Chapter 4 Question Answer The Unlikely Best Friends" height="16" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Learn-CBSE.png" width="116"/>

          </div>
          <p>
           (b) Can you think of some unlikely friends? Share your answer with your teacher.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Yes, here are a few examples of unlikely friends:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            <strong>
             A Cat and a Dog:
            </strong>
            Cats and dogs are often seen as natural enemies, but many stories and videos show them becoming best friends, playing, and even sleeping together.
           </li>
           <li>
            <strong>
             A Rich Kid and a Poor Kid:
            </strong>
            In many stories and real life, kids from vastly different economic backgrounds find common ground and become close friends, showing that friendship can transcend financial status.
           </li>
           <li>
            <strong>
             An Introvert and an Extrovert:
            </strong>
            An introvert who prefers quiet and solitude and an extrovert who loves socializing and being in crowds might seem like an unlikely pair, but they can balance each other out and learn from each other’s strengths.
           </li>
           <li>
            <strong>
             A Scientist and an Artist:
            </strong>
            Someone who is deeply analytical and someone highly creative might seem like they wouldn’t have much in common, but their different perspectives can lead to a deep and enriching friendship.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           These examples show that unlikely friendships can happen when people look beyond their differences and find shared values or interests.
          </p>

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Why did the farmer hug Buntee?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The farmer hugged Buntee as he was glad to see Buntee. The farmer has been looking for Buntee since he disappeared from his house.

          <div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Do you think Buntee will leave Gajaraj and go home with the farmer?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           No, Buntee is unlikely to leave Gajaraj and go home with the farmer voluntarily. The story shows that Buntee and Gajaraj share a deep bond and have become inseparable friends.
          </p>
          <p>
           <span style="color: #0000ff;">
            Let us discuss (Page 45)
           </span>
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Why did Gajaraj not eat his food?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Gajaraj did not eat his food because he was feeling sad and lonely after Buntee, the dog, was taken away from him. He missed his friend deeply, and this emotional distress affected his appetite.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Who were friends at the end of the story?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           At the end of the story, the friends were:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Gajaraj (the elephant)
           </li>
           <li>
            Buntee (the dog)
           </li>
           <li>
            The mahout (elephant trainer)
           </li>
           <li>
            The farmer
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           The story concludes with the reunion of Gajaraj and Buntee, who continue their friendship. Additionally, the mahout and the farmer also form a friendship as they bond over their shared concern for Gajaraj and Buntee’s happiness.
          </p>
          <p>
           <span style="color: #0000ff;">
            Let us think and reflect (Page 45)
           </span>
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the following lines and answer the questions that follow.
           <br/>
           (a) Despite royal comforts, Gajaraj was sad because he had no friends. The mahout, or elephant trainer, was the only one he ever interacted with. The mahout was a kind man who served Gajaraj food and gave him a bath in the elephant pond daily. He was a good caretaker, but not a friend.
           <br/>
           (i) Complete with one word:
           <br/>
           mahout : kind :: Gajaraj : ___________
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Sad
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The mahout was a good caretaker because he gave _________ to Gajaraj and a ______ in the pond.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Food, Bath
          </p>
          <p>
           <img alt="NCERT Class 6 English Poorvi Chapter 4 Question Answer The Unlikely Best Friends" height="16" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Learn-CBSE.png" width="116"/>
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) What do you think is the difference between a friend and a caretaker?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           while both friends and caretakers play important roles in the lives of others, the difference lies in their relationship, the roles they fulfill, and the emotional connection they share. Friends provide companionship, emotional support, and mutual understanding, whereas caretakers focus on meeting practical needs and ensuring the physical well-being of those under their care.
          </p>

           (b) “Are you missing your friend?” asked the farmer remembering the happy look on Buntee’s face while sitting on the elephant’s back. “I cannot see you go hungry,” said the farmer, “If you miss your friend so much, go to him.” The farmer removed the rope with which he had tied the dog.
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) The farmer uses the word __________________ to refer to the elephant.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           Friend
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) How did the farmer know that Buntee was hungry?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The farmer noticed that Buntee had not touched his food since coming home with him. Hence he could see that Buntee was hungry.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Why did the farmer remove the rope with which he had tied Buntee?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The farmer removed the rope because he empathized with Buntee’s longing for his friend, Gajaraj. Seeing Buntee unhappy and not eating, the farmer realized that Buntee’s happiness lay with Gajaraj. Therefore, he allowed Buntee to go back to his friend by removing the rope.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           Mahout
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Give two examples to show that Gajaraj was very happy to have a friend.
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Gajaraj shared his food with Buntee when the dog was hungry, showing his generosity and care.
           </li>
           <li>
            Gajaraj playfully splashed water on Buntee during their bath together, indicating their playful and joyful interactions.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           How did the mahout come to know that Gajaraj was sad?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The mahout noticed that Gajaraj was not eating his food, which was unusual behavior for the elephant. Despite checking Gajaraj’s physical condition and finding nothing wrong, the mahout suspected that Gajaraj might be feeling sad due to the absence of Buntee, his only friend.

          <p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Why do you think Buntee licked the farmer’s hand?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Buntee licked the farmer’s hand as a gesture of gratitude and affection. The farmer had shown kindness and understanding by allowing Buntee to return to Gajaraj, which made Buntee happy. Licking the farmer’s hand was Buntee’s way of expressing thanks and acknowledging the farmer’s compassion.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           What was ‘unlikely’ about the friendship of Gajaraj and Buntee?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The friendship between Gajaraj and Buntee was unlikely because they were different species – an elephant and a dog. Normally, elephants and dogs do not interact closely in natural settings. However, their friendship blossomed due to their shared circumstances and the emotional bond they developed through their interactions and mutual care.

           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Gajaraj was sad without a friend and when he met Buntee, he was filled with joy. ‘Sad’ and ‘filled with joy’ are opposites. Opposites can also be formed by adding some letters before a word. For example, un- unhappy, in- incorrect, dis- disconnect, mis– misuse. Now, take help from the words given as hints and fill up their opposites in the puzzle.

           Question 3.
           <br/>
           The words that tell us about an action are called verbs. In the story, the author tells us what happened before. To do that, the past form of the action word (verb) is used. Let us learn about the three forms of past tense.

           <br/>
           ‘…neither the farmer nor the mahout noticed that the two friends were in tears.’
           <br/>
           The words ‘neither’, and ‘nor’ are used to state that the farmer and the mahout did not notice the same thing. ‘Neither, nor’ connects two negative choices. For example: Neither Rohit nor I want to play football. When you need to choose between two things that you want, you may use ‘either, or’. For example: Rohit wants to play either cricket or kho-kho. It means Rohit wants to play cricket or Rohit wants to play kho-kho.

          <p>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Sentence 1:
           </strong>
           Neither Shikha nor Anuj likes to tell stories.
           <br/>
           Explanation: The sentence means that both Shikha and Anuj do not like to tell stories.
           <br/>
           “Neither” and “nor” are used to connect two negative choices, indicating that neither of the two subjects (Shikha and Anuj) likes storytelling.
           <br/>
           Example usage: Neither the cat nor the dog wants to go outside.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Sentence 2:
           </strong>
           Either Bhavesh or Abha made this painting.
           <br/>
           Explanation: The sentence means that one of the two people, Bhavesh or Abha, made the painting.
           <br/>
           “Either” and “or” are used to present two possibilities, indicating that it must be one or the other, but not both.
           <br/>
           Example usage: Either you or I will present the project.
           <br/>
           These conjunctions help in clearly specifying whether we are discussing two negative options or two possible choices. They are useful in making our statements precise and avoiding ambiguity.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Sentence 3:
           </strong>
           Neither LearnCBSE.online nor its competitors offer this unique course.
           <br/>
           Explanation: This sentence means that neither Tiwari Academy nor its competitors do not offer a unique course.
           <br/>
           “Neither” and “nor” are used to connect two negative options.

            The Unlikely Best Friends
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Let me tell you a story of a cow and a leopard from Vadodara in Gujarat who became friends. As you know, a leopard is a wild animal and a cow is a domestic animal. Some people say that the cow took care of the leopard cub like a mother. When the cub became older, it went away from the village. It returned to meet the cow at night. The villagers were worried but they never stopped the leopard. They saw that the leopard just sat beside the cow quietly. The cow and leopard spent time relaxing and playing with each other. The leopard did not like the villagers and stopped coming regularly. The villagers were surprised that the leopard never attacked the cow but became its friend.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           My friend and I are the same as we share a love for adventure. But I tend to be more spontaneous and she is more planned and organized. We both value honesty and neither of us supports dishonesty. Unlike me, she is more of a doer rather than a dreamer. Neither of us sees these differences as a barrier to our friendship.
