           Answer:
           <br/>
           (c) tn vitro replication of DNA is called PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction). The first step of PCR is denaturation, i.e. separation of dsDNA which occurs at 95°C (X). The next step is annealing of RNA primer with separated strands, for which temperature is lowered to 50°C (Y) followed by extension at 72°C (Z).

           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Having become an expert on gel electrophoresis, you are asked to examine a gel for a colleague. Where would you find the smallest fragments of DNA?
           <br/>
           (a) Near the positive electrode, farthest away from the wells
           <br/>
           (b) Near the negative electrode, close to the wells
           <br/>
           (c) Near the top, near the negative pole
           <br/>
           (d) Near the middle they tend to slow-down after the first few minutes

           <br/>
           (i) Name the naturalist who studied the kind of relationship shown in the graph. Write the observations made by him.
           <br/>
           (ii) Write the situations as discovered by the ecologists when the value of Z (slope of the line) lies between (a) 0.1 and 0.2 (b) 0.6 and 1.2. What does Z stand for?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           According to Alexander van Humboldt, species richness increases with explored area.
           <br/>
           Thus, area P with species richness (Z), 0.7 will have more species and steeper slope.
           <br/>
           Species-area relationship helps in understanding the structure of a habitat and study of factors which impact the survival of a species.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (i) Alexander von Humboldt studied the relationship shown in the graph. He observed that species richness increased within an explored area, but only upto a limit.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) (a) Value of Z lies between 0.1 – 0.2, when area is small to normal.
           <br/>
           (b) Value of Z lies between 0.6-1.2, when area is very large.
           <br/>
           Z is slope of the line, which is regression coefficient.

           Question 22.
           <br/>
           Carefully observe the pyramid of number shown below.
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 12 Biology Set 8 with Solutions 9" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-154183" height="162" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-12-Biology-Set-8-with-Solutions-9.png" width="191"/>
           <br/>
           (i) Why is this pyramid inverted?
           <br/>
           (ii) How much energy is being transferred at each level? Will the pyramid of energy if drawn for this food chain also be inverted? Give reason.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) The pyramid of number is inverted because the oak tree is only one in number as compared to the squirrels and fleas. Pyramid of number does not account for the relative size of organisms present at each trophic level.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Total 10% of the energy is transferred to each level from the lower trophic level. No, pyramid of energy will not be inverted because the producers always have more energy than other level which continuously decreases as it passes from one trophic level to next.
          </p>

           Question 23.
           <br/>
           ‘Transcription is considered more complex in eukaryotes’. Elaborate.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Transcription is considered to be more complex in eukaryotes because it has additional complexities.
           <br/>
           (i) The three types of RNA polymerases in the nucleus show division of labour.
           <br/>
           RNA polymerase-I transcribes rRNAs (28S, 18S and 5.8S).
           <br/>
           RNA polymerase-II transcribes the precursor of mRNA, called hnRNA.
           <br/>
           RNA polymerase-III transcribes tRNA, 5s rRNA and snRNA.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) hnRNA contains both coding sequences called exons and non-coding sequences called introns. Hence, it undergoes a process called splicing, in which the non-coding sequences (introns) are removed and the coding sequences (exons) are joined together in a defined order.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) In capping, unusual nucleotide, methyl guanosine triphosphate residues are added at the 5’ end of the hnRNA.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) In tailing, 200-300 adenylate residues are added at the 3’end of the hnRNA.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 24.
           <br/>
           The ability of the body (host) to fight against the disease causing agents is called immunity. It is of two types, i.e. innate immunity and acquired immunity.
           <br/>
           (i) Describe any two situations in which preformed antibodies are given to a person. What kind of immunisation is it? Also, discuss its advantages.
           <br/>
           (ii) Describe autoimmunity.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Immunisation is of two kind-active and passive. Active immunity results when exposure to a disease organism triggers the immune system to produce antibodies to that disease. It can be acquired through the natural immunity or vaccine-induced immunity.
          </p>
          <p>
           Passive immunisation is the introduction of preformed (or readymade) antibodies for an immediate immune response. It is given in the following situations
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            In the case of snake bites, an antitoxin against venom is directly given.
           </li>
           <li>
            In case of injury, tetanus injection is given to avoid muscle spasms.
            <br/>
            Advantage These preformed antibodies develop quick immune response in the recipient against the infective agents.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (ii) Autoimmunity is the state in which the body loses its ability of distinguishing between self and non-self cells.
          </p>
          <p>
           The body’s immune system starts destroying its own cells which leads to fatal malfunctions called as autoimmune diseases, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, Grave’s disease, haemolytic anaemia, etc.

           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 12 Biology Set 8 with Solutions 10" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-154184" height="232" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-12-Biology-Set-8-with-Solutions-10.png" width="261"/>
           <br/>
           (i) Write the status of food and space in the curves A and B. In the absence of predators, which one of the two curves or growth models would appropriately depict the prey population?
           <br/>
           (ii) According to you which growth curve is more realistic and why?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) The status of food and space resources in curve A is unlimited, while in curve B, the sources of food and space are limited.
           <br/>
           In the absence of predators, the curve 6 would appropriately depict the competition for limited food and shelter resources within the prey population.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Since, resources for growth of most animal populations are finite and become limiting sooner or later, the logistic growth model, i.e. curve B for population is considered a more realistic one.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 26.
           <br/>
           Human insulin can be produced in bacterial cells using biotechnology. List any two applications of recombinant DNA technology, each in medical diagnosis and agriculture.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Transgenic bacteria have been produced that translate the constituting polypeptide chains of human insulin. These polypeptides can be extracted from the bacterial cells and combined by creating disulphide bonds to produce human insulin.
          </p>
          <p>
           In humans, insulin is produced as a prohormone with three polypeptides A, B and C. After processing, the C-peptide is removed and mature insulin is formed. When transgenic bacteria are used, instead of producing extra stretch of C-peptide, only A and B polypeptides are produced and then linked to produce mature insulin directly.
          </p>
          <p>
           Various applications of recombinant DNA technology are as follows
           <br/>
           (i) Medical diagnosis It is used to detect HIV infection using ELISA.
           <br/>
           (ii) Agricultures It is used in agriculture to produce genetically modified organisms such as FlavrSavr tomatoes, Golden rice, Bt cotton, etc. These are either nutritionally enriched or resistant to pests, worms, etc.
          </p>
          <p>

           (i) Analyse the cross and predict the blood group genotype of the father. [1]
           <br/>
           (ii) Explain the phenomenon of codominance in regard of the above given cross. [1]
           <br/>
           (iii) State the basis behind the occurrence of
           <br/>
           different genotypes of blood types in human beings. [2]
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (iii) Prepare a cross to show the genotypes of children born to the parents where father has blood group A and mother has B blood group. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) In the cross given, the child 1 has blood group O, i.e. is recessive in nature. Thus, father needs to have allele i, while, child 2 has blood group B, so father need to have I
           <sup>
            B
           </sup>
           . Hence, the blood group of father would be B and the genotype is I
           <sup>
            B
           </sup>
           i.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Codominance is the phenomenon in which two alleles expresses themselves independently when present together in an organism.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) The gene I responsible for ABO blood group in humans have three alleles, i.e. I
           <sup>
            A
           </sup>
           ,I
           <sup>
            B
           </sup>
           ,i.
           <br/>
           In this, the alleles I
           <sup>
            A
           </sup>
           and I
           <sup>
            B
           </sup>
           are dominant over i and produce slightly different sugar in comparison to i which does not produces any sugar.
          </p>
          <p>
           Therefore, I
           <sup>
            A
           </sup>
           I
           <sup>
            B

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Cross 1 is associated with law of independent assortment.
           <br/>
           According to this law when two pairs of traits are combined in a hybrid, segregation of one pair of character is independent of other pair of characters. In dihybrld cross the phenotype of F
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           -generation is round yellow, wrinkled yellow, round green and wrinkled green appear in the ration of 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.
          </p>
          <p>
           Cross 2 is associated with law of incomplete dominance.
           <br/>
           Incomplete dominance is a form of gene interaction in which both alleles of a gene at a locus are partially expressed, often resulting in an intermediate or different phenotype. It is also known as partial dominance.
          </p>
          <p>
           For example, in roses, the allele for red colour is dominant over the allele for white colour. But the heterozygous flower with both the alleles are pink in colour.
          </p>
          <p>
           The F

           <sub>
            1

          </p>
          <p>
           Cross 3 is associated with law of dominance.
           <br/>
           This law states that when parents with pure, contrasting traits are crossed together, only one allele express itself in next generation. The allele which express itself is called dominant allele and which do not express is called recessive allele.

           <br/>
           (a) DNA is isolated and digested by the restriction endonucleases.
           <br/>
           (b) DNA fragments are separated by gel electrophoresis.
           <br/>
           (c) Separated DNA fragments are transferred to synthetic membranes like nitrocellulose or nylon.
           <br/>
           (d) Hybridisation using labelled VNTR probe.
           <br/>
           (e) Hybridised DNA fragments are detected by autoradiography.
           <br/>
           The sensitivity has been increased by the use of polymerase chain reaction.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) DNA polymorphism occurs due to mutation. The mutations keep on accumulating generation after generation and form one of the basis of variability/ polymorphism.

           Question 32.
           <br/>
           Antibiotic production by microorganisms is one of their more interesting features, particularly from a medical and commercial point of view. More than 10,000 antibiotics and similar bioactive metabolites have been isolated from microbes, with approximately 500 new classes of low molecular weight compounds published every year.
           <br/>
           (i) What is antibiotic and give one example?
           <br/>
           (ii) How antibiotics are produced?

           <br/>
           (i) What is shown by the bar chart?
           <br/>
           (ii) Explain the harmful effects of cigarette smoking.
           <br/>
           (iii) Explain how smoking may affect the health of the mother and the development of her foetus.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Antibiotics are substances produced by bacteria or fungi which can kill other microorganisms, especially bacteria. One of the well-known antibiotic is penicillin.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Antibiotics are produced on a large scale by the
           <br/>
           fermentation process. This is a chemical process which is induced by the microorganisms in a large tank. A large tank contains the growth medium that provides nutrition for the microorganism’s growth. Optimisation of temperature, pH levels, oxygen and nutrient in the fermentation tank is very crucial to produce antibiotic production, they are extracted and purified through multiple physical processes. Finally, the purified antibiotics are converted into crystal form.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Taking antibiotics too often or for the wrong reasons can change bacteria, so much that antibiotics do not work against them. This is called bacterial resistance or antibiotic resistance. Some bacteria are now resistant to even the most powerful antibiotics available. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem,
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (i) Bar chart simply shows, the percentage of women having babies with low birth weight increases in smokers, thus the risk increases by smoking during pregnancy.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The cigarette smoke contains nicotine which causes addiction. Nicotine causes clotting of RBC in blood and raises blood pressure. It also contains tar which constitutes many carcinogen chemicals which may cause lung cancer. Carbon monoxide is also found in cigarette smoke which can cause blockage in the coronary artery resulting in a heart attack.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Nicotine in cigarette smoke increases fatty deposits on the inner layers of blood vessels, this would reduce the diameter of lumen of blood vessels, including those that bring blood to the placenta, over time less food molecules would reach the placenta from maternal blood to foetal blood, for the growth and development of foetus.

           Question 33.
           <br/>
           Trace the events of the implantation of zygote in uterus.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Describe the embryonic development in humans.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The implantation of zygote in uterus occurs in the following steps
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            (i) The mitotic division within the zygote termed cleavage starts as the zygote moves towards the uterus through the isthmus of the oviduct.
           </li>
           <li>
            (ii) It forms 2, 4, 8 and 16 daughter cells called blastomeres.
           </li>
           <li>
            (iii) The embryo with 8-16 blastomeres is called a morula.
           </li>
           <li>
            (iv) Morula continues to divide and transforms into blastocyst as it moves further into the uterus.
           </li>
           <li>
            Blastomeres in the blastocyst are arranged into an outer layer called trophoblast.
           </li>
           <li>
            The inner group of cells attached to trophoblast constitute the inner cell mass.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           <img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 12 Biology Set 8 with Solutions 19" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-154196" height="330" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 367px) 100vw, 367px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-12-Biology-Set-8-with-Solutions-19.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-12-Biology-Set-8-with-Solutions-19.png 367w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-12-Biology-Set-8-with-Solutions-19-300x270.png 300w" width="367"/>
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Trophoblast layer then gets attached to the endometrium and the inner cell mass gets differentiated as the embryo.
           </li>
           <li>
            After attachment, the uterine cells divide rapidly and cover the blastocyst. This leads to embedding of blastocyst in the endometrium of the uterus. This is called implantation.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Or
           <br/>
           It starts after pregnancy and involves the following changes
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) The inner cell mass (embryo) differentiates into an outer layer called ectoderm and an inner layer called endoderm.
           <br/>
           (ii) Middle layer called mesoderm appears between the ectoderm and endoderm. These three layers are called primary germ layers.
           <br/>
           (iii) Primary germ layers give rise to all the tissues and organs of the adult. The inner cell mass contains certain cells called stem cells, which have the potency to give rise to all the tissues and organs.

           <br/>
           (iv) In humans, after one month of pregnancy, the embryo’s heart is formed. The sign of growing foetus can be ensured by listening to the heartbeat after 5-7 week of pregnancy.
           <br/>
           (v) By the end of second month, limbs and digits develop.
           <br/>
           (vi) By the end of third month (first trimester), most of the major organ systems are formed.
           <br/>
           (vii) During the fifth month, the first movement of foetus and appearance of hair on the head are observed.
           <br/>
           (viii) By the end of sixth month (second trimester), the body gets covered with fine hair, eyelids separate and eyelashes are formed.
           <br/>
           (ix) By the end of eight months, the testes in male foetus descend into the scrotum.
           <br/>
           (x) By the end of nine months, the foetus is fully
           <br/>
