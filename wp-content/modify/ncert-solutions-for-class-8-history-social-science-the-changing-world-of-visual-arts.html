           <br/>
           Why were people dissatisfied with British rule in the 1870s and 1880s?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The dissatisfaction against British rule was intensified in the 1870s and 1880s.
           <br/>
           1. The Arms Act was passed in 1878, which disallowed Indians from having arms.
           <br/>
           2. Same year the Vernacular Press Act was also enacted to silence the critics of the government.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The Act allowed the government to confiscate the assets of newspapers including their printing presses if the newspapers published anything “objectionable”.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           3. In 1883, there was a furore over the attempt by the government to introduce the Ilbert Bill.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The bill provided for the trial of British or European persons by Indians, and sought equality between British and Indian judges in the country.
           </li>
           <li>
            But the British (white) forced the government to withdraw the bill. Indians burst into anger. This event highlighted the whim of the British against Indians.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Who did the Indian National Congress wish to speak for?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Indian National Congress wished to speak for the entire people belonging to different communities of India.
          </p>

          </div>
          <p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           What economic impact did the First World War have on India?
           <br/>

          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>

           </li>
           <li>

           </li>
           <li>
            Increased military expenditure and demands for war supplies, resulted in a sharp rise in prices, causing great difficulties for the common people.
           </li>
           <li>
            Demand for industrial goods (jute bags, cloth, rails) and a decline of imports from other countries led to the expansion of Indian industry. So, Indian business groups earned a huge profit.
           </li>

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Muslim League resolution of 1940 asked for “Independent States’ for Muslims in the north-western and eastern areas of the country. The resolution did not mention partition or the name Pakistan.

           7. The Moderates felt that the British had respect for the ideals of freedom and justice.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>

           </li>

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Radicals within Congress cherished different opinions. They had a deep faith in action and wanted to drive away from the foreigners as soon as possible. They criticised the Moderates for their “politics of prayers’ and gave emphasis on self-reliance and constructive work. They argued that people must fight for swaraj. Unless they fought against the British rule unitedly, they would not bring independence to their country.

           </li>
           <li>
            Different classes and groups, interpreting Gandhiji’s call in their own manner, protested in their own ways. Thus, people linked their movements to local grievances.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           <strong>

           </li>

           <strong>
            Understanding of Gandhiji by the people
           </strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            People thought of Gandhiji as a messiah, as someone who could help them overcome their misery and poverty.
           </li>
           <li>
            Gandhiji wished to build class unity, not class conflict, yet peasants could imagine that he would help them in their fight against zamindars.
           </li>
           <li>

           Question 8.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Gandhiji was very much worried about the salt law. According to this law, the state had a monopoly on the manufacture and sale of salt. Gandhiji thought that it was sinful to tax salt because it is an essential item of our food and is required equally by the rich and the poor. Hence he decided to break this law in anticipation that people from all walks of life would extend their support. Needless to say that Gandhiji’s Salt March became very successful.
          </p>

           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Discuss those developments of the 1937 – 47 period that led to the creation of Pakistan.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Developments of 1937-1947 period Leading to the creation of Pakistan:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Muslim league was formed in 1906 but Congress’s failure to mobilise the Muslim masses in the 1920s allowed the League to widen its social support.
           </li>
           <li>
            In Election results of 1937, they got very less seats, even in areas where a large number of Muslims lived, made them feel as a minority community.
           </li>
           <li>
            In 1940 two nation theory was floated by them.
           </li>
           <li>
            Elections to the provinces were again held in 1946. Congress did well in the “General” constituencies but the the league’s success in the seats reserved for Muslims was spectacular. So the league persisted with its demand for “Pakistan”.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           At the time of partition Bengal was the biggest province of British India which comprised Bihar and parts of Orissa. The British argued for dividing Bengal for reasons of administrative convenience. But it was a totally false argument. In fact, the partition of Bengal was closely tied to the interests of British officials and businessmen. The British also wanted to curtail the influence of Bengali politicians and split the Bengali people. It was therefore, instead of removing the non-Bengali areas from the province, they separated East Bengal and merged it with Assam.

          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           What was the Rowlatt Act? Give an account of the Rowlatt Satyagraha.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The British passed the Rowlatt Act in the year 1919. The Act curbed fundamental rights such as the freedom of expression and strengthened police powers. The Act was very repressive and therefore it enraged Indians. Prominent leaders of the freedom struggles such as Mahatma Gandhi, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, etc. felt that the government had no right to restrict the basic freedoms of people. They viewed the Act as devilish and tyrannical. Gandhiji decided to oppose this Act. He asked people of India to observe 6 April 1919 as a day of non-violent opposition to the Act, as a day of “humiliation and prayer’ and hartal. He organised Satyagraha Sabhas to launch the movement.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Rowlatt Satyagraha spread far and wide. It became the first All- India struggle against the British government. In April 1919 several demonstrations and hartals took place in the country. But the government suppressed them taking brutal measures. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre was the climax of its brutality. This incident took place on 13 April in Amritsar on Baishakhi day. Thousands of people had gathered in the Jallianwala Bagh to celebrate the occasion. General Dyre opened fire on them all of a sudden.
           <br/>
           Both Hindu and Muslim unitedly criticised the British action.

           Describe Gandhi’s march to Dandi.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Gandhiji felt that Purna Swaraj would not come on its own. It had to be fought for. He was very much worried about government’s Salt Law. In 1930, he decided to break this law.
           <br/>
           <img alt="NCERT Solutions For Class 8 History Social Science Chapter 11 The Making of the National Movement 1870s-1947 LAQ Q2" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-107001" height="441" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 348px) 100vw, 348px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-For-Class-8-History-Social-Science-Chapter-11-The-Making-of-the-National-Movement-1870s-1947-LAQ-Q2.jpg" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-For-Class-8-History-Social-Science-Chapter-11-The-Making-of-the-National-Movement-1870s-1947-LAQ-Q2.jpg 348w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-For-Class-8-History-Social-Science-Chapter-11-The-Making-of-the-National-Movement-1870s-1947-LAQ-Q2-237x300.jpg 237w" width="348"/>
           <br/>
           According to the law, the state had a monopoly on the manufacture and sale of salt. Mahatma Gandhi and other prominent leaders of the freedom struggle thought that it was sinful to tax salt because it is an essential item of our food. Both the rich and the poor needed it equally. Gandhiji felt that his Salt March would become popular and would represent the genral desire of freedom to a specific grievance shared by all. On 6 April, 1930, Gandhiji alongwith his followers marched for over 240 miles from Sabarmati to the coastal town of Dandi. Here, they broke the government law by gathering natural salt found on the seashore, and boiling sea water to produce salt.
          </p>
          <p>
           A large number of people including women participated in this historic march. The government tried to crush the movement through brutal action against peaceful satyagrahis. Thousands were arrested and sent to jail. But the movement played a significant role in achieving freedom of India.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Under what circumstances did Gandhiji initiate the Quit India Movement?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In September 1939, the Second World War broke out. The. British government in India needed help from the Indian leaders. The leaders were ready to support the British war effort. But in return they wanted that India be granted independence after the war. The British refused to accept the demand. This enraged the Congress ministries. They all resigned to show their protest.
           <br/>
           Mahatma Gandhi was deeply perturbed. He now decided to initiate a new phase of movement against the British rule in the middle of the Second World War. This movement came to be known as the Quit India Movement. Gandhiji thought that the British must Quit India without further delay. He raised the slogan ‘do or die’ which spread among the common mass very soon. But at the same time he warned the people not to be violent in any condition.
          </p>
          <p>
           The British took repressive measures. Gandhiji along with other leaders were sent to jail immediately. But this did not prevent the movement from spreading. It specially attracted peasants and the youth who gave up their studies to join the movement. Communications and symbols of state authority were attacked all over the country. In several areas people set up their own governments. The British tried to repress these developments severely. About 90,000 people were arrested and wound 1,000 killed in police firing. But the movement did not go in vain. It brought freedom very close.
