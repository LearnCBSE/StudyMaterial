           Question 1:
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow:
           <br/>
           A research conducted by SATHI says that it is a misconception that children living on platforms are abandoned or are wrecked from homes. In reality, most of the children flee from their homes without a thought and cannot retract their actions, either because they have no money or are too frightened to go back. “We rescue 50 children daily from the platforms across the country. Some of these children get lost even as their parents search for them desperately,” said Anjali, project officer, SATHI.
          </p>
          <p>
           Life on the platform is not easy. The longer a child lives on the platform, the more he falls prey to addictions, abuse, petty thefts and odd jobs for survival. There is no place like home for a child, therefore, in extreme cases of abuse and poverty the organization’s first course of action is ’home placement.’
          </p>
          <p>
           As SATHI’s secretary Pramod Kulkarni says, ’A child on the platform never grows up, he just ages. Early intervention not only saves the child from the dangers of platform life but, also makes repatriation easier as the child is more willing to go back home.’ But, it is not an easy task. The organisation’s staff search the platforms across the country from morning till night. Children are rescued from the platforms and are placed within the safe limits of the SATHI shelters. They are counselled and those who are willing to go back home are taken to their families as soon as possible.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           Others who are reluctant to go back home are enrolled in “home orientation camps”. Love, guidance and care provided, it paves the way for effective development of problem-solving and social skills needed to build self-esteem and renew family ties. Children addicted to substance abuse are sent to de-addiction camps.
           <br/>
           (a) What has the research conducted by SATHI revealed?
           <br/>
           (b) What does the phrase ’Life on the platform is not easy’ mean?
           <br/>
           (c) What is the aim of the organization working for the welfare of these children?
           <br/>
           (d) Which is the most important step in saving the lives of children?
           <br/>
           (e) Find the word from the passage which means the same as ’advice’.
           <br/>
           (f) After the child is in the safe limits, how is he helped further?
           <br/>
           (g) What plans does SATHI have for children who do not want to go back home?
           <br/>
           (h) How are the addicted children helped?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The research has revealed that it is a misconception that children living on platforms are abandoned or are wrecked from homes.
           <br/>
           (b) This phrase means that the longer a child lives on the platform, the more he falls prey to addictions, abuse, petty thefts and odd jobs for survival.
           <br/>
           (c) home placement.
           <br/>
           (d) early intervention
           <br/>
           (e) counselled
           <br/>
           (f) They are counselled and those who are willing to go back home are taken to their families as soon as possible.
           <br/>
           (g) They are enrolled in “home orientation camps”.
           <br/>
           (h) Children addicted to substance abuse are sent to de-addiction camps.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2:
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Manufactured goods worth crores of rupees are being imported every year. There is a dearth of food. Our industries are yet in infancy. We need engineers to man them. We need mechanized farming to increase the output of com. All this is only possible if we give a technical turn to our education and if skilled labour is made available. At present there are very few technical institutions in the country. And the reason is not far to seek. Most of our young men have a sort of prejudice against all types of manual labour. They prefer a job in some office to doing work with their hands. They think that manual labour is degrading. Unemployment, therefore, stares them in the face. The jobs of clerks in offices too, are limited.
           </li>
           <li>
            Education in arts or crafts will serve a very useful purpose. It will help our youth to make an independent living. They can set up their own little workshops. This type of education will also solve the unemployment problem to some extent. We must, however, guard against one thing. Technical education in order to be of real use should be based on a good literary education at least up to matriculation standard. It has been seen that an educated craftsman has better chances of success in life than an illiterate one.
           </li>
           <li>
            India is rich in mineral resources but most of them have not been tapped. The government is keen to utilise this wealth. More and more technical institutions are, therefore, being opened. A large number of technical hands are pouring out of our universities every year. It is a happy sign of the times but, unfortunately our industries have not been able to absorb this ever- increasing number of technical hands. Already the number of unemployed technical hands has gone up. It is feared that if some quick measures are not taken to develop our industries, the government will be forced to restrict admission to the technical colleges.
           </li>
           <li>
            The work of technical training should go hand in hand with the development of industries. In this alone lies the real solution of the problem. The government too is alive to this. It is hoped that more and more factories will be opened in the near future. It will be a criminal waste of country’s intelligence if our young engineers are forced to migrate to foreign countries only because the country cannot provide them with proper means of living.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           (a) What is the cause of unemployment in India?
           <br/>
           (b) How can education in art and craft help our youth to make an independent living?
           <br/>
           (c) How can technical education be of real use?
           <br/>
           (d) How can our government stop the migration of country’s intelligence to foreign countries?
           <br/>
           (e) Which word in Para 2 means the same as ’precaution’?
           <br/>
           (f) Find the antonym of the word ’plenty’ in Para 1.
           <br/>
           (g) Find the antonym of the word ’undeveloped’ in Para 3.
           <br/>
           (h) Which word in Para 3 means the same as’limited’?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Young educated men do not want to work with their hands, they prefer office jobs but, jobs in offices are limited.
           <br/>
           (b) They can set up their own workshop, it will solve the problem of unemployment.
           <br/>
           (c) By providing good literary education upto matriculation standard.
           <br/>
           (d) More and more factories should be opened in public and private sectors to give employment to the engineers.
           <br/>
           (e) Guard
           <br/>
           (f) Dearth
           <br/>
           (g) Tapped
           <br/>
           (h) Restrict

           9:00 p.m.
           <br/>
           Dear Diary,
           <br/>
           Our excitement knew no bounds, when we had started for an adventurous trip to Rishikesh today. | We started at 5.00 a.m. and had our breakfast on the way. We reached there at around 11.00 a.m. and our camp organizer welcomed us and informed us about the dos and don’ts in the camp area. After walking down hill (300 mts. steep) we reached our camp site, where the manager told us that two camps were ready for us and that it would be our home for next two days. After keeping our bags we decided to go for Kayaking. Our instructor gave us useful tips on Kayaking, but we were not able to maintain our balance or were too slow in rowing the Kayak.
           <br/>
           We also tried swimming but there were too many rocks, so we decided to give it up. Late in the evening, we played volley ball on the beach, had tea and later had dinner and decided to rest in our tents. Hope tomorrow would be more adventurous.

           Question 4:
           <br/>
           Write a short story on the basis of given clues in 200-250 words:
           <br/>
           Robert Bruce, king of Scotland – often fought for the freedom of the country – no success – hiding in a cave – dejected – a spider drops by its thread from the ceiling – tries to get back to its web – again drops-succeeds in ninth attempt-inspired by the example, Bruce tries again. (12)
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           INSPIRATION
          </p>
          <p>
           Robert Bruce, the King of Scotland was both brave and wise. Battle after battle he fought with England. He often led his army to fight for the freedom of his country. He never gained success. At last his army was driven out and was forced to hide in the woods. They took shelter in a cave. Robert was tired and sick of heart, ready to give up hope. As he lay thinking he noticed a spider over his head who was getting ready to weave its web. He watched it as she worked slowly and with great care. For eight times it tried to throw it’s thread from one edge of the cave wall to another. Eight times the thread fell short. But spider did not lose hope. With still more care and dedication it made it’s web in the ninth attempt. This inspired and motivated Robert Bruce and he in turn motivated his army. He collected his army and led them to the battle field and this time the battle was fought and • the King of England was forced to retreat back to his country and Bruce was made the rightful king of independent Scotland.

          <p>
           Einstein hated the school’s regimentation because he was not happy with that system. There was no sense of freedom and joy in the school. So he felt suffocated under its strict regimentation, its extreme sense of discipline. The strange and strict rules of the school made him tired. As there was no respect of a child and to their rights, he often clashed with his teacher. Rather he loved mechanical toys.
           <br/>
           I think he should not have been forced to abide by the ’extremist’ or ’stereo-typed’ rules of the school. The school is a place where children get the opportunity to develop their creativity, original thoughts. But his school was the place where the authorities had no indication of his potential greatness. Acceptance and appreciation of students’ talent not only motivate them but also make them aware of the global issues and give them a chance to solve such problem as done by Einstein.8

           The poem focuses on Innisfree as a place of escape for the speaker. The speaker describes Innisfree as a simple, natural environment where he will build a cabin and live alone. ’The Lake Isle of Innisfree’ expresses the idea that nature provides an inherently restorative place to which human beings can go to escape the chaos and corrupting influences of civilization. In this poem, the speaker (Yeats) love to live in the simplicity of nature, with no extraneous distractions of city life or the superfluous habits, customs, and daily routines of an increasingly fast-paced, modem world. The speaker is only dreaming of “getting away from it all. “Even if he never goes, he will at least have the rental escape. This is the saving grace; even if he cannot get out of the city, he can imagine to escape himself to hear the lake water lapping even while standing on the pavement in the city”. There is another appeal/implication that one can never go back to the past place of nostalgia and youth, but through imagination and reflection, one can always have the mental escape and memory of another time and place.

           The people were interested to see that tiny creature found in the fields of the farmer. Be the place Brobdingang, where Gulliver had drifted, the people were six inches high, compared to them, Gulliver looked very small. So, fascinated on seeing him, a farmer planned to exhibit Gulliver to the villagers in the market to gain money. He forced Gulliver to do small tricks to attract and entertain people to earn money. Out of curiosity to see the tiny creature (Gulliver), the people came to just see
           <br/>
           him and look at the tricks. Earlier he used to get a break but later, the farmer, out of his craze to make more and more money, forced him to exhibit himself. The farmer also took him to different cities to earn money. Finally, he sold Gulliver to the Queen on seeing his falling health and approaching death due to fatigue.

Harris told George that since he had hard time in city, the same would go far the river too for a change and that change was good for everybody. Initially, George was reluctant but then he had to give in because not even in his conscience he could object. Though he tried to defy them by suggesting that he would stay back in the boat and get tea ready while Jerome and Harris towed, as making tea was such a worrying task and also they badly needed tea as Harris and the author were very tired. But then George has passed the tow-line and he silently accepted it and towed the boat onto Panton Hook.

           Montmorency, though being a dog yet the author deals with his character in detail. The dog looks like angel and with holy expression. He had a very troublesome ambition in life – to get in the way and to be sworn at. He loved to be a perfect nuisance, to make people mad and have things thrown at his head. In fact, he is quite rough and ferocious and often gets into trouble. He collects gangs of street dogs and leads them to fight against other dogs in slums. His highest ambition was to be cursed for hours for being the most irritating. He felt conceited if successful at making others lose their nerves. He caused much trouble at the time of packing – he puts his leg into the jam and spoiled three lemons. He was a born trouble shooter and he did not need any encouragement for causing troubles to others. He also adds a lot of humour to the story.
