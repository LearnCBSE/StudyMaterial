           <br/>
           The various technological and institutional reforms consist of various measures taken by the Central and State governments from time to time. Flooding of fields with water is now being replaced by drip irrigation and the use of sprinklers. Chemical fertilizers are being used on a large scale, to increase the farm yields. Bio- fertilisers are now supplementing them. High yielding and early maturing quality seeds have been developed. Most of these technology inputs gave birth to Green Revolution in sixties and seventies of twentieth century. White Revolution followed the Green Revolution.

           <br/>
           (1) Free power to a certain section of farmers has encourage them to pump ground water and grow water intensive crops in low rain fall areas also (like rice in Punjab and sugarcane in Maharashtra). As a result water storage has reduced in aquifers tube wells and many wells has run dry, which has pushed small and marginal farmers out of cultivation.
           <br/>
           (2) Inadequate storage and marketing facilities also discourage the small farmers. Thus they are badly affected by uncertainties of production and market.
           <br/>
           (3) They pay high prices for inputs like H.Y.V seeds; fertilizers etc., but the bargaining power to fix prices in their favour, is very less
           <br/>
           (4) All the production reaches the market simultaneously. The higher the supply, the lower the demand. Due to all the above given reason the food scarcity of small farmers is a big concern.

           Why has Indian agriculture been transformed from subsistence to commercial farming.
           <br/>
           <strong>

            </span>
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Before independence Indian agriculture was mainly that of subsistence farming, but now it has changed to commercial farming. The reasons are –
           <br/>
           (1) The small and scattered land holdings have been consolidated and converted to large holding and ploughed on cooperative basis.
           <br/>
           (2) The farmers have started using modern techniques of farming and scientific methods; also they have started use of fertilizers and high yielding varieties of seeds and farm machinery.
           <br/>
           (3) Irrigation methods have improved, resulting in increased soil fertility.
           <br/>
           (4) New methods of agriculture like rotation of crops, inter cropping, strip cropping, multiple cropping, have been adopted for better results.
           <br/>
           (5) As a result of production of wheat, rice, sugarcane, millets etc spices, cotton, jute, tea etc has increased many times.
           <br/>
           Due to all these reasons Indian agriculture is shifting from subsistence to commercial farming.

           <br/>
           Intensive Agriculture:
           <br/>
           (1) To obtain high yields, large capitals and labourers are applied.
           <br/>
           (2) The size of land holding is small, production per hectare is high.
           <br/>
           (3) Most of the production is consumed locally.
           <br/>
           (4) Manual labour and drought animals are mostly used.
           <br/>
           Extensive Agriculture:
           <br/>
           (1) As compared less capital and labour is applied.
           <br/>
           (2) The size of land holding is large and production per hectare is low.
           <br/>
           (3) Surplus production is sold in the market.
           <br/>
           (4) Mechanized farming is practiced. This type of farming is practiced in sparsely populated areas.

           Settled Agriculture:
           <br/>
           (1) In agricultural farms, it is practiced permanently on a small or big piece of land. In this type of agriculture, size of the field is not paid much attention.
           <br/>
           (2) The land / soil is often suitable for agriculture, if not it is made suitable by farmers, by using manures to increase the fertility of land.
           <br/>
           Shifting agriculture:
           <br/>
           (1) In this type of agriculture the place of cultivation changes after 2 to 3 crops, when there is over growth of grass, weeds etc. It is left fallow to regain its fertility.
           <br/>
           (2) The land for this type of agriculture is obtained after burning bushes etc or after cutting down trees or bushes. The farmer does not use manure to regain the fertility of the land.

           In this farmers clear a patch of land and produce cereals and other crops to sustain their family, when the soil looses its fertility, the farmers shift and clear a fresh patch of land for cultivation. Nature replenishes the fertility of soil through natural processes. Land productivity in this type of agriculture is low, because the farmers do not use fertilizers or other modern inputs. It is generally known as shifting agriculture, but also known in different names in different parts of the country.

           <br/>
           The Zamindari system in which property rights are vested on absentee landlords was abolished after India became independent. Ownership rights were transferred to the actual tillers of the land. The new land owners made improvements on their lands. This led to increase in yields.
           <br/>
           Land ceiling acts were passed to ensure that no person could hold agricultural land beyond a specified limit. The excess land was distributed among the landless labourers.
           <br/>
           Small land holdings scattered over various places were consolidated through the Consolidation of holdings Acts passed by the State legislatures. This resulted in farmers being able to fence their lands, sink wells and use modern agricultural machinery.
           <br/>
           Formation of Corporative societies helped farmers get seeds, pesticides and fertilizers at economical prices. All these helped improve the condition of the Indian farmers.

             Question-93:
            </span>
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Describe various technological and institutional reforms, which led to Green and White revolutions in India.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            <span style="color: #eb4924;">
             Solution:
            </span>
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The various technological and institutional reforms consist of various measures taken by the Central and State governments from time to time. Flooding of fields with water is now being replaced by drip irrigation and the use of sprinklers. Chemical fertilizers are being used on a large scale, to increase the farm yields. Bio- fertilisers are now supplementing them. High yielding and early maturing quality seeds have been developed. Most of these technology inputs gave birth to Green Revolution in sixties and seventies of twentieth century. White Revolution followed the Green Revolution.
