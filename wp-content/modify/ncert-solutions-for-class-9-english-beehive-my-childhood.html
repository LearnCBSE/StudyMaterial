            II. Answer each of these questions in a short paragraph (about 30 words).
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           How does the author describe:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            his father
           </li>

            his mother
           </li>
           <li>
            himself?
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           Answer:
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <ol>
           <li>
            The author describes his father as a wise and generous person. He felt happy when he helped others. He did not have much formal education and riches. He was a man of confidence and great wisdom. He avoided inessential comforts and luxuries.
           </li>
           <li>
            His mother was a noble and kind- hearted woman. She used to feed a large number of people. She had all the attributes of a typical Indian mother.
           </li>
           <li>
            I was born into a middle-class Tamil family. I was a short boy with rather undistinguished looks, born to tall and handsome parents. I studied physics and aerospace engineering and became a scientist.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           Question 2.

           What characteristics does he say he inherited from his parents?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The author inherited humility and benevolence from his parents. He learnt lessons in honesty and integrity from his parents. He was self-disciplined because of his parents’ exemplary life.

           <strong>
            III. Discuss these questions in class with your teacher and then write down your answers in two or three paragraphs each.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           “ On the whole, the small society of Rameswaram was very rigid in terms of the segregation of different social groups,” says the author.
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Which social groups does he mention? Were these groups easily identifiable (for example, by the way they dressed)?
           </li>
           <li>
            Were they aware only of their differences or did they also naturally share friendships and experiences? (Think of the bedtime stories in Kalam’s house; of who his friends were ; and of what used to take place in the pond near his house.)
           </li>
           <li>
            The author speaks both of people who were very aware of the differences among them and those who tried to bridge these differences. Can you identify such people in the text?
           </li>
           <li>
            Narrate two incidents that show how differences can be created, and also how they can be resolved. How can people change their attitudes?
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           Answer:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            The author talks about the people who belong to various castes and follow various religious preachings. Yes, these groups were easily identifiable. Their dressing, traditions, culture and rituals were different.
           </li>
           <li>
            They did share their personal experiences and friendships. Lakshmana Sastry summoned the teacher who separated the author and his friend in the class and told him that he should not spread the poison of social inequality and communal intolerance in the minds of innocent children.
           </li>
           <li>
            The school teacher encouraged communal differences and Lakshmana Sastry and Sivasubramania Iyer discouraged this malpractice.
           </li>
           <li>
            The influential people can do both the things. A teacher has the ability to bridge communal differences and can play with sentiments of the innocent and ignorant people. This is what the new teacher did. But the Science teacher Sivasubramania Iyer changed his wife’s attitude and showed her the right path.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           Question 2.
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Why did Abdul Kalam want to leave Rameswaram?
           </li>
           <li>
            What did his father say to this?
           </li>
           <li>
            What do you think his words mean? Why do you think he spoke those words?
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           Answer:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Abdul Kalam wanted to leave Rameswaram to study at the district headquarters in Ramanathapuram.
           </li>
           <li>
            His father said that he knew he had to go away to grow. He gave the example of a seagull and said that a seagull flies across the sun alone and without a nest.
           </li>
           <li>
            He spoke these words because he intended to hone his skills. He knew the harsh reality of life that children may have to live far from their parents to make their career and earn their livelihood. So he showed his wisdom and intelligence in uttering these words.
           </li>

           <li>

           </li>
           <li>
            . . . I can still feel the surge of pride in earning my own money for the first time.
           </li>
           <li>
            . . . I would later attempt to trace in the deadlines in Dinamani.
           </li>
           <li>
            . . . a short boy with rather undistinguished looks, born to tall and handsome parents.
           </li>
           <li>
            The first casualty came in the form of the suspension of the train halt at Rameswaram Station.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>

           Example: An earthquake erupted in Sicily last night.
           <br/>
           Surge means a sudden powerful forward or upward movement. A wave surges. A crowd surges. A storm surges.
           <br/>
           Example: Birds search for fish when waves surge towards the shore.
          </p>
          <p>
           2. ‘Trace’ means to find out, to copy, to draw an outline, etc. ‘Finding out’ is the closest meaning to ‘trace’ in the text.
          </p>
          <p>
           3. I can’t find the word ‘undistinguished’ in my dictionary because it is not the root word. It is there under the word ‘distinguished’ because ‘undistinguished’ is opposite to ‘distinguished’. It means: not specific, not prominent, not distinct, etc.

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Study the words in italics in the sentences below. They are formed by prefixing un- or in- to their antonyms (words opposite in meaning).
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            I was a short boy with rather undistinguished looks, (un + distinguished)
           </li>
           <li>
            My austere father used to avoid all inessential comforts, (in + essential)
           </li>
           <li>
            The area was completely unaffected by the war. (un + affected)
           </li>
           <li>
            He should not spread the poison of social inequality and communal intolerance, (in + equality, in + tolerance)
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Now form the opposites of the words below by prefixing un- or in-. The pre-fix in- can also have the forms il-, ir-, or im- (For example : illiterate—il + literate, impractical—im + practical, irrational—ir + rational). You may consult a dictionary if you wish.

Abdul Kalam talks about life’s toughest lessons learnt and his mission—being a teacher to the Indian Youth. “A proper education would help nurture a sense of dignity and self-respect among our youth”, says President Kalam. There’s still a child in him though, and he’s still curious about learning new things. Life’s a mission for President Kalam.

           2. Nonetheless, he remembers his first lesson in life and how it changed his destiny. “I was studying in Standard V, and must have been all of 10. My teacher, Sri Sivasubramania Iyer was telling us how birds fly. He drew a diagram of a bird on the blackboard, depicting the wings, tail and the body with the head and then explained how birds soar to the sky. At the end of the class, I said I didn’t understand. Then he asked the other students if they had understood, but nobody had understood how birds fly,” he recalls.

           3. “That evening, the entire class was taken to Rameswaram shore” the President continues. “My teacher showed us sea birds. We saw marvellous formations of them flying and how their wings flapped. Then my teacher asked us, ‘Where is the birds’ engine and how is it powered?’ I knew then that birds are powered by their own life and motivation. I understood all about birds’ dynamics. This was real teaching—a theoretical lesson coupled with a live practical example. Sri Sivasubramania Iyer was a great teacher. ” That day, my future was decided. My destiny was changed. I knew my future had to be about flight and flight systems.

            Career Building is the Only Goal of Education
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           The eminent educationists aver that education does not make a child a bookworm. It sharpens the pupils’ intellect and inspires them to build their career by getting themselves enrolled in professional courses. In my opinion, the fundamental goal of education is to help a learner in opting for a perfect stream and assist him in earning his livelihood.

           <br/>
           Think and write a short account of what life in Rameswaram in the 1940s must have been like. (Were people rich or poor? Hard working or lazy? Hopeful of change, or resistant to it?).
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The people of Rameswaram in 1940s were orthodox and tolerant. It is mentioned in the story that every child is bom into a specific socio-economic and emotional environment and trained in certain ways by figures of authority. The people of Rameswaram were not ready to allow anybody to instigate their children on the basis of communal intolerance. They were all religious people and did not like to enjoy the luxuries of life. They had pucca houses made of limestone and brick. They used to avoid all inessential comforts and were emotionally attached to the members of their family.

           Question 1:
           <strong>
            <br/>
           </strong>
           What do you know about A.P.J. Abdul Kalam’s family after reading the lesson “My childhood”?
           <strong>
            (Board Term 1,2012, ELI-013)
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <strong>
            <br/>
           </strong>
           A.PJ. Abdul Kalam tells us that his family was a Tamil middle class family from Rameshwaram. His father Jainulabdeen was not much educated, wasn’t rich but was generous, wise, simple man
           <br/>
           but very strict and severe. His mother Ashiamma was a generous lady, and used to feed unlimited numbers of people in their home. Kalam’s family respected all religions. They took part in Hindu festivals. His mother and grandmother told him stories from Ramayana. They always showered their love on their children and never forced their thoughts on them.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2:
           <strong>
            <br/>
           </strong>
           What incident took place at the Rameshwaram Elementry School when a new teacher came to the class ?
           <strong>
            (Board Term 1,2012, ELI-023)
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <strong>
            <br/>
           </strong>
           Kalam used to wear a cap and Ramanandha Sastry wore a sacred thread which marked him to be a Brahmin. When the new teacher came he could not tolerate a Hindu priest’s son sitting with a Muslim boy. He ordered Kalam to go and sit on the back bench. This made Ramanandha sad. Abdul started to sit in the last row but it left a bad impression on Abdul. Both the kids narrated the incident to their parents. As a result the teacher was rebuked and reprimanded for spreading communalism and hatred among children.

           Question 3:
           <strong>
            <br/>
           </strong>
           How did Abdul Kalam earn his “first wages” ? How did he feel at that time ?
           <strong>
            (Board Term 1,2012, ELI-024)
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Kalam was only 8 years old when the second world war broke out in 1939. Then there was a great demand for tamarind seeds. Abdul used to collect those seeds and sell them in the market. His cousin Shamsuddin distributed newspapers. The train would not stop at Rameshwaram and the bundles of newspapers were thrown from the running train. Abdul was employed by his cousin to collect them. This way he earned his first wages. He felt very proud on earning his first wage.

           Question 4:
           <strong>
            <br/>
           </strong>
           “Once you decide to change the system, such problems have to be confronted.” What system is being refer in the sentence from the chapter “My Childhood”? What are such problems ?
           <strong>
            (Board Term 1,2012, ELI-025)
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           System means system of discrimination on the basis of religion. The system includes the narrow-mindedness and poison of social inequality and communal intolerance. The Brahmins did not allow Muslims to enter their kitchen. The science teacher – a rebel by nature, invited Kalam to his home and proved that if one is determined to face problems and change the system, he will definitely succeed. Though, such indifferences come in everybody’s life but a person should have a broader outlook and overcome the obstacles.

           Question 5:
           <strong>
            <br/>
           </strong>
           How was the Science teacher Siva Subramaniam Iyer, though an orthodox. Brahmin with a very conservative wife, a friend of Abdul Kalam. Give incidents to support your answer.
           <strong>
            (Board Term 1,2012, ELI-025)
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Science teacher, Siva Subramaniam Iyer, wanted to break the social barriers between the Hindus and the Muslims. He wanted Kalam to be very highly educated as he recognized his intelligence. One day, he invited him over to a meal. His orthodox wife was totally horrified at the idea of a Muslim boy dining in her ritually pure kitchen. He did not mind anything said by his very conservative wife. He rather served the food to Abdul by his own hands. He also sat with him and dined together as well as invited him over again for another meal the coming weekend. Thus, this shows that he was a friend of Abdul Kalam even though Kalam was a Muslim and he himself was an orthodox Brahmin.

          <p>
           Question 1:
           <strong>
            <br/>
           </strong>
           ‘Childhood’ is the formative period of a child’s life. The lessons learnt here always stays with a person. Comment on it in the light of the lesson A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A.P.J. Abdul Kalam is one of the finest scientists in our country and was also our eleventh President. From his autobiography “Wings of Fire” it is amply clear that lessons learnt in our childhood not only shape our personality but also decide the kind of person we become. He learnt the lessons of religious tolerance, honesty and self-discipline early in his life. These qualities stayed with him throughout his life and have helped to make him one of the finest President of our country with so many diverse cultures.
