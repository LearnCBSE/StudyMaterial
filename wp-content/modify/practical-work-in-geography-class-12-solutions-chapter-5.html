           Question 2(i).
           <br/>
           Why is a field survey required?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Like many other sciences, geography is also a field science. Thus, a geographical enquiry always needs to be supplemented through well planned field surveys. It serves the following objectives:
           <br/>
           (a) These surveys enhance our understanding about patterns of spatial distributions, their associations and relationships at the local level.
           <br/>
           (b) The field surveys facilitate the collection of local level information that is not available through secondary sources.
           <br/>
           (c) The field surveys are carried out to gather required information so as the problem under investigation is studied in depth as per the predefined objectives.

           Question 2(ii).
           <br/>
           List the tools and techniques used during a field survey.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Field survey is basically conducted to collect information about the chosen problem for which varied types of tools are required. These include secondary information including maps and other data, field observation, data generated by interviewing people through questionnaires.

           Question 2(iii).
           <br/>
           What type of coverages need to be defined before undertaking a field survey?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           During field studies, investigator has to decide whether the survey will be conducted in the form of census for the entire population or will be based on selected sample. If the study area is not very large but composed of diverse elements then entire population should be surveyed. In case of a large size area, one can limit the study to selected samples representing all segments of the population.

           Question 2(iv).
           <br/>
           Describe survey design in brief.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           From functional point of view, field surveys are designed in the following steps:
          </p>
          <p>
           1. Defining the Problem: The problem to be studied should be defined precisely. It can be achieved by way of statements indicating the nature of the problem. It should also be clear through the title and sub-title of the topic of the survey.
          </p>
          <p>
           2. Objectives: A further specification of the survey is done by listing the objectives. Objectives provide outline of the survey and in accordance to these, suitable tools of acquisition of data and methods of analysis will be chosen.
          </p>
          <p>
           3. Scope: Scope of survey needs to be delimited in terms of geographical area to be covered, time framework of enquiry and if required themes of studies to be covered. This multi-dimensional delimitation of the study is essential in relation to fulfilment of the predefined objectives and limitations of analysis, inferences and their applicability.
          </p>
          <p>
           4. Tools and Techniques: Field survey is basically conducted to collect . information about the chosen problem for which varied types of tools are required. These include secondary information including maps and other data, field observation, data generated by interviewing people through questionnaires.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           5. Compilation and Computation: Surveyor needs to organise the information of varied types collected during the fieldwork for their meaningful interpretation and analysis to achieve the set objectives. Notes, field sketches, photographs, case studies, etc. are first organised according to sub-themes of the study. Similarly, questionnaire and schedule based information should be tabulated either on a master sheet or on the spreadsheet.
          </p>
          <p>
           6. Cartographic Applications: Different methods of mapping and drawing of diagrams and graphs and also use of computer in drawing them neatly and accurately. For getting visual impressions of variations in the phenomena, diagrams and graphs are very effective tools. Therefore, the description and analysis should be duly supported by these presentations.
          </p>
          <p>
           7. Conclusion: At the end a report is prepared. On the basis of the report, we can provide the summary of the investigation.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2(v).
           <br/>
           Why is the well-structured questionnaire important for a field survey?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Questionnaire plays an important role in a field survey. If it is properly designed, certainly we shall get accurate results from our investigations. On the other hand, if it is not properly designed then it will lead to many problems. Rather the entire purpose of field survey will be defeated. Questionnaire is the most commonly used method in survey. Questionnaire is a list of questions either open-ended or close -ended for which the respondent gives answers. Questionnaire can be conducted via telephone, mail, live in a public area, or in an institute, through electronic mail or through fax and other methods.
           <br/>
           There are some points which must be borne in mind while constructing a questionnaire.
           <br/>
           To draft a questionnaire or schedule is an art. The success of statistical investigation depends on proper drafting of the questionnaire. It is a highly specialised job and following points should be borne in mind:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The number of questions in a schedule should be brief and limited as possible. Only relevant questions to the problem under investigation should be added. Ideally it should be between 20-30.
           </li>
           <li>
            The questions should be simple, clear and precise. Its language should be very simple so that informants may easily understand.
           </li>
           <li>
            All unambiguous questions should be avoided at all, complicated and long- worded questions irritate the respondents which results in careless; replies.
           </li>
           <li>
            No personal questions should be asked from respondents. Such questions should be avoided.
           </li>
           <li>
            For example
            <ul>
             <li>
              Do you take alcohol?
             </li>
             <li>
              Do you tell a lie?
             </li>
             <li>
              Does your boss scold you? â€˜
             </li>
            </ul>
           </li>
           <li>
            Questions should be framed with right words. This ensures the validity. Starting a question with negative is undesirable. For example, Donâ€™t you think India is a corrupt country?
           </li>
           <li>
            Questions should not be based on calculations. Only those questions should be asked which the respondents may reply immediately. Moreover, questions should avoid memories.
           </li>
           <li>
            The objective type questions should be given preference. Either MCQ or yes-no options should be given but in case of need and requirement of investigation, open ended questions can also be used.
           </li>
           <li>
            The arrangement of the questions should be such it involves a logical flow of questions. For example, it is not making sense to ask a person:
            <ul>
             <li>
              What is your income?
             </li>
             <li>
              Are you employed?
              <br/>
              Or
             </li>
             <li>
              How many kids do you have?
             </li>
             <li>
              Are you married?
             </li>
            </ul>
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           3. Design a field survey on any one of the following problems:
           <br/>
           (a) Environmental Pollution

           Question 1.
           <br/>
           How are information gathered in field surveys?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Sources of collecting information can be primary or secondary. Primary sources include field surveys, interviews, direct oral investigation, etc. Secondary sources can be published or unpublished. For example, different government, semi government, non-government, national and international agencies and other than this newspapers, magazines, private publications and electronic media are other sources.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Do field surveys provide completeness to geographical investigation?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Actually Geography is a field descriptive science. To make its subject matter reliable and full proof we need to conduct field surveys. These are helpful in providing completeness to geographical investigation.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Which features can be exhibited in maps in field surveys?
           <br/>
           Answer: Maps topographic details including relief, drainage, water bodies, settlements, means of communications and other topographical features of a village and its surrounding region can be shown through maps. These maps provide spatial dimension of inequality in land distribution if plotted by ownership of households.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           What is the role of the investigator in field survey?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Investigator plays an important role in any field survey. He has to define the problem, determine the objectives of field survey, scope of field survey and decide the tools and techniques to be used for survey. The investigator has to comprehend the situation and processes in totality and at the place of their occurrence. He is the one who finally prepares a report and derives final conclusions.

           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Explain the importance of field survey in scope of the subject matter of geography. Answer: Geographical issues addressed pertain to global or national or regional or local level. In other words, the given information helps us understand the issues at macro level. The regional level information is used to analyse different physical and human parameters of a large area. Similarly, information has to be gathered at the local level by conducting primary surveys for generating information. For understanding these issues many primary surveys are conducted. The primary surveys are also called field surveys. They help in understanding all such issues to a great extent.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           These are collected and published by different government agencies, organisations and other agencies. This information along with cadastral and topographical maps, provides basis to prepare the framework of survey. Different types of data can be obtained from specialised agencies. For example, listing of households, persons, landholdings in the survey area can be done using the official records or electoral rolls available with the village panchayat or the revenue officials. Essential physical features like relief, drainage, vegetation, land use and cultural features like settlements, transport and communication lines, irrigation infrastructure, etc. can be traced out from the topographical maps.

           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Why are interviews given importance in surveys related to social issues?
           <br/>
           Answer: In all field surveys, dealing with social issues information is gathered through personal interviews. Experiences and knowledge of each individual about his/ her environs as well as about his/her own livings are nothing but information. These experiences, if retrieved efficiently are important sources of information. However, extraction of information through personal interviews is greatly influenced by interviewerâ€™s abilities in terms of understanding of the subject and the people to be interviewed, communicative skills and rapport with the people.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           In the modem world where on one side we are touching new heights of development, environmental pollution is becoming a serious problem on the other hand. There are three main components of environment: water, air and earth. These are seriously struggling with the problems of pollution. The impact of pollution is visible on flora, fauna, human and air. The factors which cause pollution are called pollutants. Pollutants are chemical, solid waste and poisonous gases. Natural and human factors are responsible for this pollution. Volcanic eruptions and landslides are natural causes while industrial and domestic factors are responsible for pollution as human factors. In this we shall select an industrial region and suggest measures for the development of such systems which can help to control and improve the situations.
