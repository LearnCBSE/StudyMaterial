           CBSE Class 8 English Grammar Preposition
          </h2>
          <p>
           A preposition is a word placed before a noun or pronoun to show its relation with some other word in the sentence.
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            He works hard in the hope of standing first.
           </li>
           <li>
            We met at night.
           </li>
           <li>
            The book is on the table.
           </li>
           <li>
            We stay at home during the holidays.
           </li>
           <li>
            I will be there by ten O’ clock.
           </li>
           <li>
            It has rained for three hours.
           </li>
           <li>
            He pointed to the tree.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           In the above sentences, the italicised words in. at. on. by. for and to are preposi¬tions. The nouns that come after them are called their objects. Thus, ‘hope’ is the object of ‘in’ ; home is the object of at: holidays is the object of ‘during’. ‘Ten is the object of ‘by’; hours is the object of for’ and tree is the object of to.
           <br/>
           The Prepositions generally serve three important purposes :

            (B) Indicating Place

           <br/>
           <strong>
            1. Residence (Countries, towns etc.)
           </strong>
           <br/>
           (i) When the reference is general, use in
           <br/>
           Many people live in cities/villages/suburbs/deserts/countries/towns

           But

           He lives at the seaside.
           <br/>
           He lives on an island.
           <br/>
           Note. 1. Village, suburb, desert, country and town are imagined as closed entities and hence the preposition in (i.e., inside).
           <br/>
           On the other hand seaside means near the sea and hence the preposition at ; Island is imagined as something open and so the preposition on.

           <strong>
            2. Residence (Houses etc.)

          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) For a house with a name or address use at:

          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) For the names of streets and roads use in :

           I wrote a letter.
           <br/>
           Children like sweets.
           <br/>
           In each of these sentences the verb takes an object. ‘Song’, ‘letter’ and ‘sweets’ are objects. A verb that takes an object is called a Transitive Verb. The object usually answers the question what ? Or whom ?
           <br/>
           Now look at the following sentences :
           <br/>
           Birds fly.
           <br/>
           The sun shines.
           <br/>
           These verbs do not require objects. They express the actions by themselves and make the sense complete. They are called Intransitive Verbs. Some Verbs can be used both Transitively and Intransitively.
