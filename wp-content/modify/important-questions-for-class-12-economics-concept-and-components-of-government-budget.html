            Ans.
           </strong>
           Even distribution of wealth and social welfare remains one of the main objective of budgetary policy. The government uses progressive taxation policy to reduce the inequalities of income and wealth in the country. People with higher incomes are levied higher rate of tax and people with lower income are levied lower rate of tax. People with income below a certain level are not levied any direct tax altogether.
           <br/>
           On the other hand, the government spent these tax receipts on granting subsidies and providing other public services such as health and education free of cost, to people with lower income groups. Thus, the wealth gets redistributed and reduction in inequalities is achieved.

           <strong>
            Ans.

The government uses progressive taxation policy to reduce the inequalities of income and wealth in the country. Government imposed high tax rates on higher income group and low tax rate on lower income group. People with income below a certain level are not levied any direct tax altogether. On the other hand, the government spent these tax receipts on granting subsidies and providing other public services such as health and education, to people with lower income groups, the wealth gets redistributed and reduction in inequalities is achieved.

           <br/>
           <strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           The economic value that is reflected in the rise in the production of public goods is the ‘social welfare’. The major objective of the budgetary policy of the government is to enhance the welfare of the society as a whole. For this, it performs the allocative function. The allocative function is concerned with allocating the resources between private and public sectors. As the public goods cannot be provided by the private sectors through market mechanism, hence the need for providing such goods is to be fulfilled by the government.
           <br/>
           In addition to this, private goods cannot be afforded by all, that is, only those who can pay for these goods can avail the benefits of such goods. But, as the public goods as required by all and are essential from welfare point of view, thus, government provide these goods.
