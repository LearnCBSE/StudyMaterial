           <li>
            <strong>

            <br/>
            goods which satisfy the human wants directly. They cannot be seen or touched, i.e., they are intangible in nature. These are medical care, transport and communications, education, domestic services rendered by hired servants, etc.

           </span>
           In layman terms, the domestic territory of a nation is understood to be the territory lying within the political frontiers (or boundaries) of a country. But in national income accounting, the term domestic territory is used in a wider sense. Based on ‘freedom’ criterion, the scope of economic territory is defined to cover:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Ships and air crafts owned and operated by normal residents between two or more countries. For example, Indian Ships moving between China and India regularly are part of domestic territory of India. Similarly, planes operated by Air India between Russia and Japan are part of the domestic territory of India. Similarly, planes operated by Malaysian Airlines between India and Japan are a part of the domestic territory of Malaysia.
           </li>
           <li>
            Fishing vessels, oil and natural gas rigs and floating platforms operated by the residents of a country in the international waters where they have exclusive rights of operation. For example, Fishing boats operated by Indian fishermen in international waters of Indian Ocean will be considered a part of domestic territory of India.
           </li>
           <li>
            Embassies, consulates and military establishments of a country located abroad. For example, Indian Embassy in Russia is a part of the domestic territory of India.
            <br/>
            ‘Consulate’ is an office or building used by consul (an officer commissioned by the government to reside in a foreign country to promote the interest of the country to which he belongs).

             2. “All Producer Goods are not Capital Goods”. Explain.
            </strong>

             Ans:
            </strong>
           </span>
           Producer goods are all those goods which are used in the process of production i.e., which are used in the production of other goods. Producer goods include two types of goods:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Single-use Producer Goods:
            </strong>
            Goods used as raw material by the producers. It includes raw material like coal, wood, etc. They are not capital goods as they cannot be repeatedly used in the production process.
           </li>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Capital Goods:
            </strong>
            Goods which are used as fixed assets by the producers, like plant and machinery, which can be repeatedly used in the production process.
            <br/>
            So, it can be said that all capital goods are producer goods, but all producer goods are not capital goods.
           </li>

            <strong>
             Ans:
            </strong>
           </span>
           No, it is not necessary that machine purchased is a final good. It will depend upon its use.
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            If a machine is purchased by a household, then it is a final good. For example, washing machine purchased by a consumer household is a final goods.
           </li>
           <li>
            If it is purchased by a firm for its own use, then it is also a final good. For example, refrigerator purchased by a firm.
           </li>
           <li>
            If it is bought by a firm for resale, then it is an intermediate good. For example, machine purchased by a machine dealer.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           <span style="color: #993366;">

             4. “ Machine purchased is always a capital good.” Do you agree? Give reasons for your answer.

           </span>
           <br/>
           <span style="color: #008000;">
            <strong>
             Ans:
            </strong>
           </span>
           No, it is not necessary that machine purchased is a capital good. It will depend upon its use.
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            If a sewing machine is purchased by a tailor, then it is a fixed asset of the tailor and considered to be a capital good. But the same machine purchased by a consumer household is considered to be a durable use consumer goods.
           </li>
           <li>
            If a car purchased by a taxi driver as a taxi or if purchased by a firm for use in its business is a capital good. But the same car purchased by a consumer household is a durable use consumer goods.
            <br/>
            <strong>
             Note:
            </strong>
            So, finally, the end user of a good determine, whether it is capital good or durable use consumer goods. If an end user of a durable goods is a producer, it is a capital good. If an end user of a durable goods is a consumer household, it is a durable use consumer goods. So, capital goods are only those durable goods which are used as producer goods, not as consumer goods.

            </strong>
           </span>
           The concept of domestic territory helps to estimate ‘Domestic Product’. As we know Domestic Product includes goods and services produced by production units located in the domestic territory (irrespective of fact whether carried out by residents or non-residents). The money value of domestic product is termed as Domestic Income.

           <br/>
           <span style="color: #008000;">
            <strong>
             Ans:
            </strong>
           </span>
           The concept of Normal Resident helps to estimate “National Product’. National Product includes production activities of normal residents irrespective of fact whether performed within the economic territoiy or outside it. The money value of national product is termed as National Income.
