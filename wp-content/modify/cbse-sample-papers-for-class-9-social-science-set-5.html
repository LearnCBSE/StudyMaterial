           Question 31.
           <br/>
           How far was the Communist Government responsible for the famine that occurred in China in 1958-1961? Explain.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           What weaknesses of democracy do you observe in India? [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) China’s famine 0 1958-1961 was the worst recorded famine in the world history. Nearly three crore people died in this famine. During those days, India’s economic condition was not much better than China’s. Yet, India did not have a famine of the kind in China.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The Communist Government of China did shut down the gates for international business (import primarily) so, when they had poor food production and also they were not accepting international imports, it led to problems which promoted the famine of 1958.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) The government wanted to revolutionise farming by discarding existing knowledge in favour of new techniques. Farmers were ordered to ‘close plant’ (sowing millions of seeds of different species together in a small area) and ‘deep-plough’ (digging the ground much deeper to encourage deep root growth). Both these experiments failed and entire plantings yielded next to nothing. Farmers were forbidden to use chemical fertilisers and large amounts of land were left fallow with poor results.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) A more tangible cause of famine was grain procurement by the state. From 1953, all Chinese farmers were required to sell grains to the government, at prices and levels decided by the government. Some of these grains were redistributed back to the farmers.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) Most, however, was either sent to the cities (the so-called ‘urban food bias’), sold as export grains or distributed as foreign aid, to create the illusion of a booming economy. By the summer of 1959, however, food shortages had reached a critical point. Mao Zedong’s response was to attack his critics rather than relax his policies.

           Although democracy has been accepted as the best form of government in the modern world, yet it has its own problems. They are:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Growing economic and social in equalities among the people: Although all the citizens have the right to vote and fight elections, vet only rich people have a chance to win the election.
           </li>
           <li>
            Role of anti-social elements: Voters are forced to vote for a particular candidate or party. Rigging also takes place during the elections.
           </li>
           <li>
            Corruption and inefficiency: In many democratic countries of the world, political leaders and government officials are corrupt, dishonest, and inefficient. This affects the working of democracy very badly.
           </li>
           <li>
            Casteism and communalism: There are other big challenges in many democratic countries like India. During elections, a large number of voters vote based on the caste and religion of the candidate.
           </li>
           <li>
            Political parties also keep in mind the caste or religion of a person while distributing the tickets of the election.

           What is growth of population? Explain the three ways by which we can express population change. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            India’s population has been steadily increasing from 361 million in 1951 to 1210 million in 2011.
           </li>
           <li>
            It reveals that from 1951 to 1981, the annual rate of population growth was steadily increasing, which explains the rapid increase in population from 361 million in 1951 to 683 million in 1981.
           </li>
           <li>
            Despite the decline in growth ratio, the number of people being added every decade was steadily increasing.
           </li>
           <li>
            Since 1981, however, the rate of growth started declining gradually. During this period, birth rates declined rapidly.
           </li>
           <li>
            Still 182 million people were added to the total population in the 1990s alone (an annual addition larger than ever before).
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           OR
           <br/>
           Growth of population: It refers to the change in the number of inhabitants of a country/territory during a specific period of time, say during the last 10 years.
          </p>
          <p>
           Population change can be expressed in the following ways:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            In terms of absolute numbers, and
           </li>
           <li>
            In terms of percentage change per year.
           </li>
           <li>
            The absolute numbers added each year or decade is the magnitude of the increase. It is obtained by simply subtracting the earlier population from the later population. It is referred to as the absolute increase.
           </li>
           <li>
            The rate or the pace of population increase is the other important aspect. it is studied in percent per annum. This is referred to as the annual growth rate.

           <li>
            The var also had a severe impact on industry. Russia’s own industries were few in number and the country was cut off from other suppliers of industrial goods by German control of the Baltic Sea.

           Read the source given below and answer the questions that follow: (1+1+2=4)
           <br/>
           The percentage of the population that is economically active is an important index development. The distribution of the population according to different types of occupation is referred to as the occupational structure. An enormous variety of occupations are found in any country Occupations are, generally classified as primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary,’ activities include agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, and fishing. mining and quarrying, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
           Secondary activities include the manufacturing industry building and construction work, etc. Tertiary activities include transport. communications1 commerce, administration, and other services. The proportion of people working in different activities varies in developed and developing countries. Developed nations have a high proportion of people in secondary and tertiary activities. Developing countries tend to have a higher proportion of their workforce engaged in primary activities.
          </p>
          <p>
           In India, about 64 percent of the population is engaged only in agriculture. The proportion of the population dependent on secondary and tertiary sectors is about 13 and 20 percent respectively. There has been an occupational shift in favour of secondary and tertiary sectors because of growing industrialisation and urbanisation in recent times.

           Read the source given below and answer the questions that follow: (1+1+2=4)
           <br/>
           When the Bolsheviks ordered land redistribution, the Russian army began to break up. Soldiers, mostly peasants, wished to go home for the redistribution and deserted. Non-Bolshevik socialists, liberals, and supporters of autocracy condemned the Bolshevik uprising. Their leaders moved to South Russia and organised troops to fight the Bolsheviks (the ‘reds). During 1918 and 1919, the ‘greens’ (Socialist Revolutionaries) and ‘whites’ (pro-Tsarists) controlled most of the Russian empire.
          </p>
          <p>
           They were backed by French, American, British, and Japanese troops-all those forces who were worried about the growth of socialism in Russia. As these troops and the Bolsheviks fought a civil war, looting, banditry, and famine became common. Supporters of private property among ‘whites’ took harsh steps with peasants who had seized land. Such actions led to the loss of popular support for the non-Bolsheviks. By January 1920, the Bolsheviks controlled most of the former Russian empire.
          </p>
          <p>
           They succeeded due to cooperation with non-Russian nationalities and Muslim adidists, Cooperation did not work where Russian colonists themselves turned Bolshevik. In Khiva, in Central Asia, Bolshevik colonists brutally massacred local nationalists in the name of defending socialism. In this situation, many were confused about what the Bolshevik government represented.

           <br/>
           In Pakistan, General Pervez Musharraf led a military coup in October 1999. He overthrew a democratically elected government and declared himself the ‘Chief Executive’ of the country. Later he changed his designation to President and in 2002 held a referendum in the country that granted him a five-year extension. Pakistani media, human rights organisations, and democracy activists said that the referendum was based on malpractices and fraud. In August 2002, he issued a ‘Legal Framework Order’ that amended the Constitution of Pakistan.
          </p>
          <p>
           According to this Order, the President can dismiss the national and provincial assemblies. The work of the civilian cabinet is supervised by a National Security Council which is dominated by military officers. After passing this law, elections were held in the national and provincial assemblies. So, Pakistan has had elections, and elected representatives have sorne powers. But the final power rested with military officers and General Musharraf himself.
