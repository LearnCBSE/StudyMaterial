            Answer.
           </strong>
           Ozone layer is very important for the existence of life on earth. The function of the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere is to absorb most of the harmful ultraviolet radiations coming from the sun and prevent them from reaching the earth’s surface.

            Question.5. Why are forests considered “biodiversity hot spots”? List two ways in which an individual can contribute effectively to the management of forests and wildlife.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Due to the presence of a large number of species (of plants and animals) threatened with extinction, forests are said to be ‘biodiversity hotspots’.
           <br/>
           The two ways in which an individual can contribute effectively to the management of forests and wildlife are:
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <ol>
           <li>
            As individuals we can try to cut down the use of products directly obtained from forests such as gum, rubber, wood, paper, etc., thereby protecting against the excessive cutting of trees.
           </li>
           <li>
            As individuals we must discourage and protect against the poaching of wild animals for commercial use.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Question.6. What is meant by “sustainable management”? Why is reuse considered better than recycling?
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           The development and management of resources in such a way which meets the current basic human needs and also preserves the resources for the needs of future generations, is called sustainable management.
           <br/>
           The process of ‘reuse’ is considered better than the process of ‘recycling’ because recycling requires the use of a large amount of energy and money whereas no energy is required for reusing materials.

            Question.14. “We cannot pass on to our progeny the experiences and qualifications earned during our life time”. Justify the statement giving reason and examples.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           All traits of the parent cannot be transmitted to the offspring because all traits are not inherited traits, some of the characteristics are acquired. The experiences and qualifications earned during our lifetime are examples of acquired traits.
           <br/>
           A trait of an organism which is ‘not inherited’ but develops in response to the environment is called an acquired trait. The acquired traits of organisms cannot be passed on to their future generations.
           <br/>
           Only those traits can be transmitted to future generations in which changes have occurred in the genes present in the reproductive cells of parent organisms.
           <br/>
           For example, If we breed some mice, all the progeny of mice will have tails, just like parents. Now, if we cut the tails of these first generation mice surgically and breed them, we will get new mice, all with full tails. Despite the cutting of tails of mice for a number of generations, a tailless mouse is never born.
           <br/>
           This is because the cut tail of mice is an acquired trait which is never passed on to their progeny. This is because cutting the tails of mice does not Change the genes of their reproductive cells.

           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           (a) The eyes seen in planaria, insects, octopus and vertebrates vary greatly in their structure. These Organisms can be used for studying evolution of eyes as the eyes of planaria are simple without lens, insects have compound eyes and vertebrates have highly specialised eyes. However, all of them perform the same function, that is, vision. Thus, a common evolutionary origin can be established.
           <br/>
           (b) Birds have evolved from reptiles as the connecting link between reptiles and birds is Archaeopteryx (flying dinosaur). Also, there are some similarities in birds and reptiles. Birds have a four-chambered heart/ which is also a feature of some reptiles. Both birds and reptiles have separate sexes and internal fertilization occurs in both.

            Answer.

           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           At the time of sunrise and sunset when the sun is near the horizon, the sunlight has to travel the greatest distance through the atmosphere to reach us. During the long journey of sunlight, most of the shorter wavelength blue-colour present in it is scattered out and away from our line of sight so, the light reaching us directly from the rising sun or setting sun consists mainly of longer wavelength red colour due to which the sun appears red. Due to the same reason, the sky surrounding the rising sun and setting sun also appears red. Thus, at sunrise and sunrise, the sun itself as well as the surrounding sky appear red.

            Answer.
           </strong>
           (i) Burning of plastic is not an eco-friendly method of waste disposal because it

            Question.19. Explain why carbon forms compounds mainly by covalent bond. Explain in brief two main reasons for carbon forming a large number of compounds. Why does carbon form strong bonds with most other elements?
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           The atomic number of carbon is 6 which means that a neutral atom of carbon retains 6
           <br/>
           electrons. So, the electronic configuration of carbon is K, L. Since, carbon has 4 electrons in its outermost shell so, it should either lose or gain 4 electrons to achieve the inert gas configuration and become stable.
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            It could gain four electrons forming C
            <sup>
             4-
            </sup>
            anion. But it would be difficult for the nucleus with six protons to hold on to ten electrons due to inter electronic repulsion.
           </li>
           <li>
            It could lose 4 electrons forming C
            <sup>
             4+
            </sup>
            cation. But it would require a large amount of energy to remove four electrons from its outermost shell.
            <br/>
            Thus, it forms compounds mainly by covalent bonds.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Two properties of carbon which lead to huge number of carbon compounds are:
           </strong>
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Catenation. Catenation is the unique property of carbon atoms to form bonds with other atoms of carbon giving rise to large molecules.
           </li>
           <li>
            Tetravalency. Since carbon has a valency of 4, it is capable of bonding with 4 other atoms of carbon or atoms of some other monovalent element.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           The reason for the formation of strong bonds by the carbon atoms is their small atomic size. Due to the small size of carbon atoms their nuclei hold the shared pairs of electrons between atoms strongly, leading to the formation of strong covalent bonds. The carbon atoms also form strong covalent bonds with the atoms of other elements such as hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, chlorine and other elements.

           Functions of:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Ovary—Ovaries are the primary reproductive organs in a woman (or female). The function of ovaries is to produce mature female sex cells called ‘ova’ or ‘eggs’ and also to secrete the female sex hormones.
           </li>
           <li>
            Oviduct—The ovum (or egg cell) released by an ovary goes into the oviduct through its funnel shaped opening. The fertilisation of egg by a sperm takes place in the oviduct.
           </li>
           <li>
            Uterus—The growth and development of a fertilised ovum (or fertilised egg) into a baby takes place in the uterus.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           After fertilisation, zygote is formed which develops into an embryo. The embryo gets nutrition from the mother’s blood with the help of a special tissue called placenta. This is a disc which is embedded in the uterine wall. It contains finger-like projections called villi on the embryo’s side of the tissue. On the mother’s side are blood spaces, which surround the villi. This provides a large surface area for glucose and oxygen to pass from the mother to the embryo. In this way, the embryo gets its nutrition.

           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           (a) We need to manage our natural resources because of the following reasons:
           <br/>
           The resources of the earth are limited. As the human population is increasing rapidly, the demand for resources increases day by day. The proper management can ensure that these resources last for the generations to come.
           <br/>
           (b) The proper management of natural resources takes into consideration a long-term perspective so that these natural resources are used judiciously at present and their exploitation to the hilt for short term gains is prevented. This is essential to meet their future needs and demands.

           (i) Na has the largest atomic radius because on moving from left to right in the periodic table, lb . ‘omic radius decreases due to increase in positive charge on the nucleus which pulls the outermost electrons in more close to the nucleus and the size of atom decreases.
           <br/>
           (ii) Al is least reactive because on moving from left to right in the periodic table the nuclear charge increases and the valence electrons are pulled in more close to the nucleus.
