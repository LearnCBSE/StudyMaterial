          </h2>
          <p>
           1. Fertilisation is the process of fusion of a sperm with an ovum.
           <br/>
           (i)Semen of a male is transferred by the penis to the vagina of female during copulation (coitus) and is called insemination.
           <br/>
           (ii)Spermatozoa move through the cervix, enter the uterus and reach the ampullary isthmic junction of Fallopian tube, where fertilisation takes place.
           <br/>
           (iii)Fertilisation takes place only if the ovum released by the ovaries and sperms are transported simultaneously to the ampullary-isthmic junction of the Fallopian tube.
           <br/>
           (iv)During fertilisation, a sperm comes in contact with zona pellucida layer of the ovum and induces changes in the membrane that block the entry of other sperms ensuring that only one sperm fertilise an ovum.
           <br/>
           (v)The secretions of the acrosome help the sperms enter into the cytoplasm of the ovum through the zona pellucida and the plasma membrane.
           <br/>
           (vi)This induces the completion of the meiotic division of the secondary oocyte which results into the formation of a haploid ootid and a small second polar body.
           <br/>
           (vii)The haploid nucleus of the sperms and that of ovum fuse together to form a diploid zygote.
           <br/>
           (viii) After fusion of the male and female gametes, the zygote would carry either XX or XY depending on whether the sperm carrying X or Y fertilised the ovum. The zygote carrying XX would develop into a female baby and XY would form a male baby.
          </p>
          <p>
           2.Implantation of zygote occurs in the following steps:
           <br/>
           (i)The mitotic division within the zygote termed cleavage starts as the zygote moves towards the uterus through the isthmus of the oviduct.
           <br/>
           (ii)It forms 2, 4, 8 and 16 daughter cells called blastomeres
           <br/>
           (iii)The embryo with 8-16 blastomeres is called a morula
           <br/>
           <img alt="important-questions-for-class-12-biology-cbse-fertilisation-pregnancy-and-embryonic-development-t-33-1" height="364" loading="lazy" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5708/23293830596_011641e41a_o.png" width="547"/>
           <br/>
           (iv)Morula continues to divide and transforms into blastocyst as it moves further into the uterus.
           <br/>
           (v)Blastomeres in the blastocyst are arranged into an outer layer called
           <br/>
           (vi)The inner group of cells attached to trophoplast are called the inner cell mass.
           <br/>
           (vii)Trophoblast layer then gets attached to the endometrium and the inner cell mass gets differentiated as the embryo.
           <br/>
           (viii) After attachement, the uterine cells divide rapidly and covers the blastocyst. This leads to embedding of blastocyst in the endometrium of the uterus. This is called implantation.
          </p>
          <p>
           3.Pregnancy starts after implantation. Following changes occur during pregnancy.
           <br/>
           (i)The finger-like projection appear on the trophoblast called chorionic villi, surrounded by the uterine tissue and maternal blood.
           <br/>
           (ii)Both the uterine tissue and chorionic villi become interdigitated with each other and jointly form a structural and functional unit between developing embryo and maternal body-called placenta.
           <br/>
           (iii)Placenta transports oxygen and nutrients to the foetus and removes carbon dioxide and excretory waste materials produced by the embryo.
           <br/>
           (iv)Placenta also acts as an endocrine tissue and secretes hormones like human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), human Placental Lactogen (hPL), oestrogen, progesterone, etc.
           <br/>
           (v)A hormone called relaxin is secreted by the ovary, in later phase of pregnancy.
           <br/>
           (vi)Umbilical cord connects the placenta with foetus and helps in transport of substances to and from embryo.
           <br/>
           (vii)During pregnancy, the levels of other hormones like oestrogen, progesterone, cortisol, prolactin, thyroxine, etc., are increased many times in the maternal blood. These hormones support the foetal growth, maintenance of pregnancy and metabolic changes in mother.

            4.Embryonic development
           </strong>
           starts after pregnaney with tKe following changes:
           <br/>
           (i)The inner cell mass (embryo) differentiates into an outer layer called ectoderm and an inner layer called endoderm.
           <br/>
           (ii)Middle layer called mesoderm appears between the ectoderm and endoderm.
           <br/>

           <br/>
           (iii)Primary germ layers give rise to all the tissues and organs of the adult. The inner cell mass contains certain cells called stem cells, which have the potency to give rise to all the tissues and organs.
           <br/>
           (iv)In humans, after one month of pregnancy, the embryo’s heart is formed. The sign of growing foetus can be ensured by listening the heartbeat.
           <br/>
           (v)By the end of second month, limbs and digits develop.
           <br/>
           (vi)By the end of third month (first trimester), most of the major organ systems are formed.
           <br/>
           (vii) During the fifth month, the first movement of foetus and appearance of hair on the head are observed.
           <br/>
           (viii) By the end of sixth months (second trimester), the body is covered with fine hair, eyelids separate and eyelashes are formed.
           <br/>
           (ix) By the end of eight months, the testes in male foetus descend into the scrotum.
           <br/>
           (x) By the end of nine months, the foetus is fully developed and ready for birth.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            5.Parturition
           </strong>
           <br/>
           (i) The average duration of human pregnancy is about 9 months, which is called gestation period.
           <br/>
           (ii)Vigorous contraction of the uterus at the end of pregnancy causes expulsion/delivery of the foetus. The process of delivery of foetus (childbirth) is called
           <br/>
           (iii)Parturition is induced by complex neuroendocrine mechanism.
           <br/>
           (iv)Relaxin hormone is secreted by the ovary to facilitate parturition by softening the connective tissue of symphysis pubica.
           <br/>
           (v)Foetus and the placenta induce mild uterine contractions called foetal-ejection reflex. This initiates the release of oxytocin hormone from the posterior pituitary.
           <br/>
           (vi)Oxytocin acts on uterine muscle to cause stronger contractions, which in turn stimulate further secretion of oxytocin. This causes more stronger contractions leading to the expulsion of the baby out of the uterus through the b|rtb canal, i.e. parturition occurs.
           <br/>
           (vii)After the baby is delivered, the placenta is also expelled out of the uterus.
          </p>
          <p>
           6.Parturition is followed by the lactation which requires certain changes in the mother’s body.
           <br/>
           (i) Mammary glands of the female undergo differentiation during pregnancy.
           <br/>
           (ii) By the end of pregnancy, these start producing milk by the process called lactation.
           <br/>
           (iii)During the initial few days of lactation, the milk produced is called colostrum.

           </strong>
           In humans, the fertilisation of ovum takes place in ampullary-isthmic junction of Fallopian tube.
           <br/>
           The events that occur during the process of fertilisation are:
           <br/>
           (a) The sperm reaches the junction of ampulla and isthmus and comes in contact with zona pellucida layer of ovum.
           <br/>
           (b) Acrosome of sperm head release sperm lysin enzymes that dissolves corona radiata and digests zona pellucida layer and enters cytoplasm.
           <br/>
           (c) Entry of sperm stimulates secondary oocyte to complete its suspended second meiotic division, thus producing haploid egg or ovum and second polar body.
           <br/>
           (d)Nucleus of sperm and of ovum fuses to form a diploid zygote.

           </strong>
           Development of zygote up to implantation takes place in following sequence
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Cleavage division (mitotic) starts in zygote as it moves through the isthmus of Fallopian tube towards the uterus.
           </li>
           <li>
            This division results into 2, 4, 8 and 16 daughter cells called blastomeres.
           </li>
           <li>
            The embryo with 8-16 blastomeres is called morula.
           </li>
           <li>
            Morula continues to divide and transforms into blastocyst as it moves further into uterus.
           </li>
           <li>
            Blastomeres in the blastocyst are arranged into an outer layer called trophoblast and inner group of cells attached to trophoblast called inner cell mass.
           </li>
           <li>
            Trophoblast layer then gets attached to the endometrium and the inner cell mass gets differentiated as the embryo.
           </li>
           <li>
            After attachment, the uterine cells divide rapidly and cover the blastocyst.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           It leads to blastocyst’s embedding in the endometrium of the uterus. This is called implantation.
           <br/>
           (iii) Blastocyst stage implants in the uterus.

           .(i)Seminal vesicle spermatogenesis It secretes an alkaline fluid that helps in neutralising the acidity of the vaginal tract and thereby increase the lifespan of sperms. Secretion of seminal vesicle is also a source of nutrition for the sperms.
           <br/>
           (ii) Scutellum It is a tissue present in seed to absorb food from the adjacent endosperm and develop into growing embryo.
           <br/>
           (iii) Acrosome It is the cap-like covering or structure that is present at the tip of the sperm (male gamete). The acrosome contains enzymes, which help the sperm enter into the cytoplasm of the ovum and thus helps in fertilisation.

           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (i)The human testes are located outside the abdominal cavity.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (ii)Some organisms like honeybees are called parthenogenetic animals.[All India 2012]
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           Testes are located outside the abdominal cavity within a pouch called scrotum. Scrotum maintains low temperature of the testes (2-2.5°C lower than normal body temp­erature) required for spermatogenesis.
           <br/>
           (ii) In honeybees, workerbees are all females. Sometimes, they may develop functional ovaries and lay unfertilised eggs, which normally result into drone bees. Hence, worker bees are capable of producing diploid eggs parthenogenetically and replaces the queen bee if she dies. Since, they develop from unfertilised diploid eggs (and do not undergo fertilisation) they  are called parthenogenetic animals.
