           <sub>
            0
           </sub>
           <br/>
           Answer:

           </sub>
           a n²

           Assertion (A) Acceleration of a magnet falling through a long solenoid decreases.
           <br/>
           Reason (R) The induced current produced in a circuit always flow in such direction that it opposes the change or the cause the produced it. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:

           For total internal reflection occurrence, the incident angle must be greater than the critical angle.
           <br/>
           ∴ Let us calculate critical angle C.
           <br/>

          <p>
           ∴ sin C = \(\frac{ 1 }{ \left(\frac{{ }_a \mu_g}{{ }_a \mu_w}\right) }\)

          </p>
          <p>
           or sinC = \(\frac{ 8 }{ 9 }\) = 0.88 ⇒ C = 61.6°
           <br/>
           [As sin 60° = √3/2 = 0.86]
          </p>
          <p>
           As the critical angle, i.e, 61.6° is greater than the angle of incidence, i.e. 60°, hence TIR will not occur.

           In a periodic table, the average atomic mass of magnesium is given as 24.312 u. The average value is based on their relative natural abundance on the earth.

           The three isotopes and their masses are

           The natural abundance of \({ }_{12}^{24} \mathrm{Mg}\) is 78.99% by mass. Calculate the abundances of other two isotopes. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Given, atomic mass of Mg = 24.312 u
           <br/>
           Mass of \({ }_{12}^{24} \mathrm{Mg}\) = 23.98504 u

           Mass of \({ }_{12}^{25} \mathrm{Mg}\) = 24.98584 u
           <br/>
           Mass of \({ }_{12}^{26} \mathrm{Mg}\) = 25.98259 u
           <br/>
           Abundance of \({ }_{12}^{24} \mathrm{Mg}\) = 78.99%
           <br/>
           Let the abundance of (fMg be x %.

           The abundance of

           \({ }_{12}^{26} \mathrm{Mg}\) = 100 – 78.99 – x = (21.01 – x)%

           Question 23.

           A cube of side b has a charge q at each of its vertices. Determine the potential and electric field due to this charge array at the centre of the cube. [3]

           <br/>
           Side of the cube = b

           Potential at point 0 due to one charge,
           <br/>
           V = \(\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0}\) • \(\frac{q}{r}\)
          </p>
          <p>
           Potential at point O due to all charges placed at the vertices of the cube,
           <br/>
           V’ = 8V = \(\frac{8 \times 1 \times 9}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 r}\) = \(\frac{8 q \times 2}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 \cdot b \sqrt{3}}\) [from Eq. (i)]
           <br/>
           = \(\frac{4 q}{\sqrt{3} \pi \varepsilon_0 b}\)
          </p>
          <p>
           The electric field due to one vertex is balanced by the electric field due to the opposite vertex because all charges are positive in nature. Thus, the resultant electric field at the centre O of the cube is zero.

           Question 25.

           A conductor of length l is connected to a DC source of potential V. If the length of the conductor is tripled by gradually stretching it, keeping V constant, how will
           <br/>
           (i) drift speed of electrons and
           <br/>
           (ii) resistance of the conductor be affected? Justify your answer. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When a wire is stretched, then there is no change in the material of the wire, hence its volume remains constant.
           <br/>
           The potential V = constant, l’ = 3l
           <br/>
           (i) Drift speed of electrons = \(\frac{V}{\text { nelp }}\)
           <br/>
           ∴ V ∝\(\frac{1}{l}\) [∵ other factors are constants]
           <br/>
           So, when length is tripled, drift velocity gets one-third.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Here, volume remains constant, V

           = \(\frac{A_1}{3}\)
           <br/>
           i.e. When length is tripled, area of cross-section is reduced to \(\frac{A}{3}\).
          </p>
          <p>
           Hence, R = ρ \(\frac{l’}{A’}\) = ρ \(\frac{3l}{\frac{A}{3}}\) = 9 ρ \(\frac{l}{A}\) = 9R
          </p>
          <p>
           Thus, new resistance will be 9 times of its original value.

           (i) Due to varying current in P, the flux linked with P change and hence 0 changes, which in turn induces the emf in G and bulb B lights, where P and G are coils.
           <br/>
           (ii) When 0 is moved left or it goes away from P, the lesser flux change takes place in 0. This leads to decrease the value of rate of change of magnetic flux and hence, lesser emf and bulb B gets dimmer.
           <br/>
           (iii) Lenz’s law states that the polarity of induced emf is such that, it tends to produce a current which opposes the change in magnetic flux that produced it.
           <br/>
           Yes, emf will be induced in the rod as there is change in magnetic flux.

During the formation of p-n junction and due to the concentration gradient across p-type and n-type, holes diffuse from p-side to n -side and electron diffuse from n-side to p -side.

           (ii) An optical fibre is a thin tube of transparent material that allows light to pass through, without being refracted into the air or another external medium. Optical fibres make use of total internal reflection.
          </p>
          <p>
           Optical fibres are fabricated with high quality composite glass/quartz fibres. The refractive index of core is higher than that of the cladding. When a signal in the form of light is directed at one end of the fibre at a suitable angle, it undergoes repeated total internal reflection along the length of the fibre and finally, comes out from other end. Due to total internal reflection at each stage, no absorption of light takes places, i.e. there is no appreciable loss in the intensity of light.

           Given, AB = BC = CD = DE = EF = FA = 10 cm
           <br/>
           As, the hexagon has six equilateral triangles, so the distance of centre 0 from every vertex is 10 cm.
           <br/>
           i.e. OA = OB= OC = OD = OE = OF = 10 cm
           <br/>
           ∴ Potential at point O = Sum of potentials at centre O due to individual point charge

           <sub>

           <br/>
           (a) Under which conditions would the rms currents in the two circuits be the same?
           <br/>
           (b) Can the rms current in circuit (II) be larger than that in (I)? [2]
           <br/>

           <br/>
           (a) Which curve shows power consumption over a full cycle?
           <br/>
           (b) Identify the device X. [2]

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) In an inductor, the current lags the voltage by 90°. If the source voltage is sinusoidal, then the current is also sinusoidal, but shifted in phase. The instantaneous power defined as the product of the instantaneous voltage and current can also be seen to be sinusoidal in time. However, in contrast to the resistive load, the instantaneous power in the inductor goes negative for part of the cycle of the source driving it.

           <br/>
           The instantaneous power alternates positive and negative at twice the frequency of source supplying it.
