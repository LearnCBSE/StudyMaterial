            <br/>
           </strong>
           According to the ‘circle of justice’ it was important for military commanders to keep the interest of peasantry in mind. As is clear from the following:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            A king survived on soldiers.
           </li>
           <li>
            Soldiers worked for salaries.
           </li>
           <li>
            Salaries came from revenue collected from peasants.
           </li>
           <li>
            Peasant would pay revenue when they are prosperous and happy. This in turn will happen when there is justice and honest governance.
           </li>
          </ol>

            Answer:
           </strong>
           The ‘internal’ frontier means the hinterland of the garrison town.
           <br/>
           The ‘external’ frontier means the areas beyond the hinterland of the garrison towns.

            7.  What were the steps taken to ensure that muqtis performed their duties? Why do you think they may have wanted to defy the orders of the Sultans?

            Answer:
            <br/>
           </strong>
           Steps taken to ensure that the muqtis performed their duties well:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Appointment of accountants to check the amount collected by the muqtis.
           </li>
           <li>
            Collection of revenues only which were prescribed by the state, not more than that in any circumstances.
           </li>
           <li>
            Fixation of limit to keep the required number of soldiers.
           </li>
           <li>
            They might be shifted to another area.
           </li>
           <li>
            The muqtis may have wanted to defy the orders of the Sultans because restrictions imposed on them were very rigorous.
           </li>
           <li>
            Their appointment was temporary.
           </li>

            8. What was the impact of the Mongol invasions on the Delhi Sultanate?
            <strong>
             Ans.
            </strong>
            The Delhi Sultanate mobilised a large standing army in Delhi. It posed a big administrative challenge.
            <br/>
            Answer:
           </strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Alauddin Khalji constructed a new garrison town at Siri for his soldiers. He imposed taxes on land to feed the army at the rate of 50 percent of peasant’s yield. He began to pay the soldiers in cash.
           </li>
           <li>
            Muhammad Tughluq shifted people of Delhi to Daulatabad in south and thus converted Delhi into a garrison town. He also disbanded the army. He also paid the soldiers in cash.

            9. Do you think the authors of tawarikh would provide information about the lives of ordinary men and women?

           <strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           I don’t think like that. It is because the authors of tawarikh lived in cities mainly Delhi. They were not in touch of village people. They often wrote their histories for Sultans in the hope of rich rewards. They had nothing to do with common mass. Hence, it was obvious that the information provided by them would lack ordinary men and women.

            Answer:

           </strong>
           We think that even today women leaders are not accepted more readily. We can see this in respect of 33% reservation of women in parliament.

            Answer:
            <br/>
           </strong>
           The Delhi Sultans were interested in cutting down forests to expand their kingdom which was till then restricted to the Delhi Sultanate.
          </p>
          <p>
           No, deforestation does not occur for the same reasons today. Today it occurs for additional land for habitation, road expansion, road construction, industries, and urbanization.

           </strong>
           The authors of tawarikh were learned men. They were secretaries, administrators, poets and courtiers who recounted events as well as advised rulers on governance, emphasising the importance of just rule. The authors of tawarikh lived in cities mainly in Delhi and therefore they were cut off from the village. They used to write histories in praise of the Sultans and in return got rich rewards. These authors advised rulers that they should follow an ideal social order based on birthright and gender distinctions. Common mass had nothing to do with their ideas.

           Raziyya was Sultan Iltutmish’s daughter. She became Sultan in 1236. She was very talented. According to the chronicler of the age, Minhaj-i-Siraj, she was more able and qualified than all her brothers. But she was not accepted when she became a ruler. Those were the days when women were not allowed to enjoy independent identity. They were supposed to be subordinate to men. This led to her removal from the throne in 1240.

           The Khaljis and Tughluqs raised people of humble birth who were often their clients, to high political positions. They were appointed as generals and governors. However, this also introduced an element of political instability. Slaves and clients, the people of humble birth, were loyal to their masters and patrons but not to their heirs. Now Sultans had their own servants. As a result the accession of a new monarch often saw conflict between the old and the new nobility.

            Answer:
           </strong>
           Large parts of the subcontinent remained outside the control of the Delhi Sultans because they were very far from Delhi. For example, it was difficult to control Bengal from Delhi. This helplessness of the Delhi Sultans paved the way for distant provinces to get independence. Even in the Gangetic plain there were forested areas that Sultanate forces could not penetrate. It was a golden opportunity for the local chieftains to establish their rule in these regions.

           The chieftains fortified themselves in mountains, in rocky, uneven and rugged places as well as in bamboo groves. The bamboo had unique features. It was strong and even fire could not affect it because its several party were intertwined making them very strong. The chieftains lived in these forests which served them as rampart. They had everything necessary for life such as cattle, crops, water, etc. inside the forests. Thus, they were safe. Only powerful armies could subdue them.

           Alauddin gave great importance to his soldiers because it was they who could defend the Sultanate from outsiders. He decided to pay their salaries in cash rather than iqtas. The soldiers would buy their supplies from merchants in Delhi and it was thus feared that merchants would raise their prices. To stop this, Alauddin controlled the prices of goods in Delhi. For this Alauddin instructed officers to carefully survey prices. The merchants who did not sell their goods at the prescribed rates were punished.

           Tughluq did not control prices of the goods. Instead, he used a token currency, made out of cheap metals, and not of gold and silver. People in the 14th century did not believe in these coins. They saved their gold and silver coins and paid all their taxes to the state with this token currency. This cheap currency could be counterfeited easily.

           Sher Shah Sur (1540—1545) established a powerful state. He started his career as the manager of a small territory for his uncle in Bihar and eventually challenged and defeated the Mughal Emperor Humayun. Sher Shah captured Delhi and established his own dynasty known as the Suri dynasty. Although the Suri dynasty ruled for only a short period i.e. 15 years, it introduced an administration that borrowed elements from Alauddin khalji and made them more efficient. The great emperor Akbar followed the techniques of Sher Shah’s administration while consolidating the Mughal Empire.

            Answer:

           During the reign of Alauddin Khalji Mongol attacks increased. It was a huge administrative challenge for the Sultan. He introduced several administrative measures:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Alauddin Khalji raised a large standing army as a defensive measure.

           <li>
            He constructed a new garrison town known as Siri for his soldiers.
           </li>
           <li>
            The soldiers had to be fed. This was done through the produce collected as tax from lands between the Ganga and Yamuna. Tax was fixed at 50% of the pleasant’s produce.
           </li>
           <li>
            He paid his soldiers cash salaries rather than iqta. This was done in order to make soldiers able to buy their supplies from merchants in Delhi. It was feared that merchants would raise their prices. In order to stop this Alauddin controlled the prices of goods in Delhi. Prices were carefully surveyed by officers and merchants who did not sell at the prescribed rates were punished.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
           1. He took several administrative measures like Alauddin Khalji he also raised a huge standing army in Delhi.
          </p>

           2. He got emptied the oldest of the four cities of Delhi (Delhi-i Kunba) in order to garrison his soldiers there. The  residents of the old city were sent to the new capital of Daulatabad in the south.
          </p>
          <p>
           3. He made arrangements for the collection of produce as tax to feed the soldiers. As it was very difficult to  maintain a large number of soldiers the Sultan levied additional taxes which coincided with famine in the area.
          </p>
          <p>
           4. Muhammad Tughluq paid soldiers cash salaries. For this he introduced ‘token’ currency made of cheap metals. People in the 14th century did not trust these coins. They saved their gold and silver coins and paid  all their taxes to the state with this token currency.

           Muhammad Tughluq’s administrative measures were a failure, we can prove this statement with following points:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            He campaigned into Kashmir which was finally a disaster. He then gave up his plans to invade Transoxiana and disbanded his large army.
           </li>
           <li>
            His administrative measures created problems. He shifted the residents of the old city to the new capital of Daulatabad in the south. People did not like this step taken by Muhammad Tughluq. They resented collectively.
           </li>
           <li>
            Tughluq, in order to meet the expense of maintaining a large number of soldiers, levied additional taxes which increased the burden of common people.
           </li>
           <li>
            The famine in the Ganga-Yamuna belt led to widespread rebellion.
           </li>
           <li>
            Muhammad Tughluq’s policy of ‘token’ currency also proved a failure. People of the 14th century did not trust this currency. They were very smart. They saved their gold and silver coins and paid all their taxes to the state with the token currency. This cheap currency could also be counterfeited easily.
