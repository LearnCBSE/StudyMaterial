           Questions 2.
           <br/>
           Politics is more than what politicians do. Do you agree with this statement? Give examples.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The various arguments have been raised on this issue:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Politics is associated with the manipulation and pursue ambitions and satisfy wants.
           </li>
           <li>
            Political leaders and persons who contest elections and hold public office, are argued to after a public service.
           </li>
           <li>
            A few people argue that politics is what politicians do-who sometimes practices floor-crossing (Aya Ram or Gaya Ram), commit false promises, pursue an individual interest in place of nation as a whole or having a criminal background sometimes, what about this notion?
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Hence, the following prescriptions can be found out:
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <ul>
           <li>
            It is unfortunate that politics has been associated with the pursuit of personal interests only and the need is to realise that politics is an integral part of the society.
           </li>
           <li>
            The important focus should be on how governments are formed and how they function because governments play an important role in different institutions and help people to fulfill their needs and aspirations.
           </li>
           <li>
            People may also be engaged in political activity to participate collectively in politics to promote social development and resolve the problems of common people.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Questions 3.
           <br/>
           Vigilant citizens are a must for the successful working of a democracy. Comment.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Vigilant citizens are a must for the successful working of a democracy for the following
           <br/>
           reasons:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Vigilant citizens encounter the corrupt actions of their representatives and democratic government due to be aware in politics.
           </li>
           <li>
            Vigilant citizens form a public opinion by forming associations, public meetings, etc. against the malpractices done by the politicians, i.e. defection, false commitments to people, to look after only their own individual or family members’ interest, etc.
           </li>
           <li>
            Vigilant citizens keep a check on wrong policies issued by the government and corruption which endanger people’s lives and security as well.
           </li>
           <li>
            Vigilant citizens can organise the campaign also to negotiate the interests of particular groups and demonstrations to persuade the government to change the laws if required.
           </li>
           <li>
            Vigilant citizens aspire to create a better society by debating the actions of their representatives.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Questions 4.
           <br/>
           In what ways is the study of political theory useful for us? Identify four ways in which the political theory can be useful to us?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Political theory advocates the various views to be needed as science or art.
           <br/>
           As a science: The following functions of political theory has been propounded by David Easton as a science:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            A political theory ensures analytical scheme which renders research meaningful and describes the mutual relations of political variables.
           </li>
           <li>
            The comparative study of various researchers verify the conclusions and reveal the areas to be required more empirical work.
           </li>
           <li>
            A relative consistent concepts make research more reliable.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           As a social and natural entity: In the words of Wright and Mills:
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <ul>
           <li>
            It is an ideology of justified practices to make criticism and to determine policies.
           </li>
           <li>
            It prepares goals and guidelines for aspirations and policies made at various levels of ideals.
           </li>
           <li>
            It prepares strategies and programmes to meet both the ends and means.
           </li>
           <li>
            It assumes the formation of society and conflicts to be arisen in the society as well as solutions to the particular  conflicts.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Conclusion: Political theory can be concluded as a collection of systems and analysis of political data. It also aims to achieve a better world of politics.
          </p>
          <p>
           Questions 5.
           <br/>
           Do you think that a good/ convincing argument can compel others to listen to you?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Yes, I agree that a good argument can compel others to listen to me, because:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Everyone who is rationale always takes interest in debates, conversation or interactions to reach at a better conclusion.
           </li>
           <li>
            Every individual is impressed with the logic and rational points to be agreed/ convinced upon.
           </li>
           <li>
            In a positive manner, if I make the efforts to convince others, they listen to me very carefully.
           </li>
           <li>
            In a discussion or debate, even people participate to make their doubts clear and get convinced.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Questions 6.
           <br/>
           Do you think studying political theory is like studying mathematics? Give reasons for your answer.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           No, studying political theory is not like studying mathematics because mathematics can have a specific definition of any shape or particular areas which may be applicable as per terms but political theory deals with the needs and aspirations of the peoples and states who may have different opinions on different issues to be encountered to develop harmonious relations.

           Though freedom is guaranteed in our Constitution, we encounter new interpretations all the time. This is a bit like playing a game; as we play chess or cricket, we learn how to interpret the rules. In the process, we discover new and broader meanings of the game itself. Similarly, the fundamental rights guaranteed by our Constitution are continually being reinterpreted in response to new circumstances. For instance, the right to life has been interpreted by the Courts to include the right to livelihood. The right to information has been granted through a new law. Societies frequently encounter new challenges which generate new interpretations. The fundamental rights guaranteed by our Constitution have been amended and expanded over time through judicial interpretations and government policies which are designed to address new problems.

           Political theory deals with the ideas and principles that shape Constitutions, governments and social life in a systematic manner. It clarifies the meaning of concepts such as freedom, equality, justice, democracy, secularism and so on. It probes the significance of principles such as rule of law, separation of powers, judicial review, etc. This is done by examining the arguments advanced by different thinkers in defense of these concepts. Though Rousseau or Marx or Gandhi did not become politicians, their ideas influenced generations of politicians everywhere. There are also contemporary thinkers who draw upon them to defend freedom or democracy in our own time. Besides examining arguments, political theorists also reflect upon our current political experiences and point out trends and possibilities for the future.
