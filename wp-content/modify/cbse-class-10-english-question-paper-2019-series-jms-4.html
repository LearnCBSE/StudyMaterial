           [A] The chart below displays data about the five worst faring states in COVID-19 infrastructure. Write a paragraph analysing the given data. 8

           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           [B] Read the following excerpt from an article that appeared in the magazine section of a local daily.
           <br/>
           School bullies are a menace, they should be expelled.
           <br/>
           Write a paragraph to analyse the given argument.
           <br/>
           You could think about what alternative explanations might weaken the given conclusion and include rationale/evidence that would strengthen/ counter the given argument. 8
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           [A] The chart given tells us that out of an average of 1167 isolation beds per million people in India, Jharkhand, accounts for only 470 beds per million people whereas Bihar has the lowest of 306 beds per million people. Bihar also fares the worst in terms of the available ICU beds which are five per millon people in comparison to Odisha’s thirteen and a total of 48 per million people in India. As far .as the oxygen supported beds are concerned, out of an average of 175 per million people. Tripura has 58, which is the highest and Assam has 49 and is at the bottom. Out of the 24 ventilators available per million prople in India, Assam and Odisha have the highest number which is one-third of the national avarge. To conclude it is evident that Bihar fares the worst in health care infrastructure.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           [B] There is no doubt that school bullies should fall under the ‘Zero’ tolerance rule and they are a menace but should they actually be expelled? Expelling them from school does not solve the problem of bullying. Children should be taught through love, compassion and counselling the value of being nice to their fellow students. Love and perseverance is one of the best ways to teach people to change any negative behavioural characteristics.
           <br/>
           Very often the students who are at the receiving end are the ones who are afraid to speak out. It is these students who need to be given the confidence to speak-up. By expelling bullies from school without effecting a change in their behaviour will make them grow up to be unhappy, unsocial human beings. They must get a chance to improve or else they may become victims of unchecked aggression in adulthood.

           (b) Describe the scenery that Rajvir saw as their train pulled out of the station?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The scenery that met his eyes was beautiful. It was green everywhere. Rajvir had never seen so much greenery before. Then the soft green paddy fields gave way to tea-bushes. It was indeed a magnificent view as tea-bushes stretched as far as the eyes could see. Besides the tiny tea plants were tall sturdy shade-trees and in the middle rows of the bushes moved doll-like women, plucking the tea-leaves.

           (c) Why is the poet writing long letters? Why does she not mention the departure of the trees?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The poet is a witness to the trees exodus. She sits and writes long letters in which she does not mention the departure of the forests. Through her letters the poet addresses an audience, where she is an audience herself. Her head is full of whispers. The poet reaches across the barrier between the poem and audience through her letters, a transaction that occurs on a page.
          </p>
          <p>
           The poet does not mention ‘the departure of the forest from the house’ to suggest that plants and trees are used for interior decoration’ in cities, while forests, are cut down, are imprisoned and need to ‘break out’. ‘The poet also wants to highlight that we are often silent about important happenings that are unexpected, as they embarrass us. She feels guilty for merely looking at them as they depart.

           Think-Tank considers Earth as a ridiculous little planet which he intends to put under his generous rulership. He feels Earth is actually an insignificant place where ugly earthlings, with their tiny heads, dwell. He thinks his own race, the Martians, are a more handsome race. His main ambition is to invade the Earth, which he refers mockingly to as ‘that primitive ball of mud’, before lunch. He perceives himself to be the ‘most fantastically intellectually gifted being in the land.’

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Valli’s earnest wish was to ride on the bus that traveled between her village and the nearest town. Her meticulous planning and strong will power made her plan and execute the journey successfully. She saved money, gathered the required information and waited patiently for the right time to go on her journey.
          </p>
          <p>
           For many days and months Valli listened carefully to conversations between her neighbours and people who regularly used the bus. She asked a few questions. Thus she picked up various small details about the journey. The town was six miles from her village. The fare was thirty paise one way. She calculated and recalculated, planned and replanned. She saved whatever coins came her way, resisting every temptation to buy peppermints, toys, balloons. She resisted a strong desire to ride the merry-go-round at the village fair. In this way, Valli sacrificed on many little joys to achieve her dream of going on a bus ride.

           Or

           The play ‘The Proposal’ is all about Lomov’s marriage proposal to Chubukov’s daughter, Natalya and how it gets side-tracked twice due to the quarrelsome attitudes of the would- be life partners. There is no serious issue of dispute between Lomov and Natalya. They first quarrel over the petty issue of the ownership of the Oxen Meadows. Then they quarrel over the superiority of their respective dogs. Both the issues are unimportant as Lomov and Natalya get married eventually. Lomov appears to be a physically weak and mentally unstable man. Natalya is an excellent housekeeper but also stupid and quarrelsome. If Lomov was a strong and determined man he would not have let the argument go out of hand. Had Natalya been smart and intelligent she would have handled the entire situation rationally.

           How did Ebright use determination and perseverance to achieve his aim of becoming a scientist?
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           We need intelligence more than physical strength in a difficult situation. How is it proved true in the story, “The Midnight Visitor” ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Even as a child, Ebright was a keen learner. He started collecting butterflies as early as kindergarten. He even collected rocks, fossils and coins and was an eager astronomer. By the time he was in second grade, Ebright had collected all twenty-five species of butterflies found around his hometown. This indicates that he always had a curious and bright mind. It was only after losing at the science fair that Ebright did realize what real science was all about. It was really a sad feeling for him as he sat at the fair and did not get anything while everybody else had won something. Ebright’s entry was a slide of frog tissues which he showed under a microscope. He realized the winners had tried to do real experiments not just make a neat display. It was then that the competitive spirit that drives a man appeared in Ebright and this motivated him further to become a bright scientist.

           <br/>
           There is no doubt that Ausable wins over a very critical situation due to his sheer presence of mind. Ausable had ordered a drink and knew that it was the waiter knocking at the door. Being a clever and sharp man he immediately thought of a plan. He told Max it was the police who had come to check on him and could shoot him. He asked Max to jump out of the window into the balcony. But actually there was no balcony on the other side of window and Max fell down with a thud, thus leading to his end. Ausable did not use any kind of physical force to get rid of Max and by pure presence of mind was able to complete his mission. His intelligence proved to Fowler that appearances can be misleading and one can never judge a person on the basis of his looks.

           Sir
           <br/>
           Through the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I would like to draw your attention to issue of education of the girl child.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is rather unfortunate that despite all the incentives the government is providing to encourage education of the girl child, their number has not risen to the desired level in the schools. It is of grave concern that young girls are married off early and are not sent to school by their parents. The impact of child marriage is devastating for girls in terms of lost education, lost earning opportunities as well as health risks. Although there are many barriers to overcome this problem, gender disparity and gender inequality need to be re¬addressed over and over again.
          </p>
          <p>
           There should be schemes for awarding prizes to the villages and schools all over the country which show the largest proportional enrollment and average attendance of girls. Moreover a strong public opinion for girls education needs to be created. I am sure by taking up these few simple steps, the situation of education of girls in many parts of the country will improve to the desired level.

           This valuable heritage needs urgent attention failing which it is bound to be ruined in the very near future. It is my sincere appeal to the authorities to help in the restoration and preservation of this valuable heritage. All the ancient monuments in our country are an integral part of our rich cultural heritage and so we need to take care of them. They serve as important reminders of the past events and cultures and are a tangible representation of the civilization in which they were constructed.
          </p>

           By: Shreyas
          </p>
          <p>
           The massive influx of people from small towns and villages into metropolitan cities has various adverse consequences on all sections of society. The fast paced growth of urban population has caused a great strain on the capacity of the municipal corporation to provide even the basic utilities like housing, water, electricity and sewerage. It has also led to the springing up of unauthorised slums at every available space.

           The rise of these unplanned squatter settlements are a clear index to the unbearable living conditions that immigrants face. This problem needs to be tackled on an urgent basis. The Government must plan on how to create more job opportunities in villages and small towns so that people living there do not feel the need to move to cities. The Government should plan its strategies and investments in such a way that the rural population is provided with economic opportunities other than agriculture. Only then can the false lure of cities as lucrative places for a better life can be removed from the minds of the rural population.

           <br/>
           Through the medium of the columns of your esteemed newspaper I wish to express my concern regarding the misplaced condition about those whose lives have been uprooted due to the devastating floods in Uttarakhand.
          </p>
          <p>
           As we all are aware the floods in Uttarakhand have wiped out hundreds of villages, leaving numerous people homeless and without any source of livelihood. In their hour of crisis it is the duty of each one of us to come forward to help these unfortunate people in an effort to rebuild their lives. I would like to appeal to the responsible citizens of our country to donate generously to the Uttarakhand Relief Fund. Your invaluable help in cash and kind will help these people at a time when they are direly in need.
          </p>
          <p>
           I hope you will publish my letter in your newspaper so that people are inspired to donate generously to the Uttarakhand Relief Fund.

           Subject. Nuisance created by the stray Animals
          </p>
          <p>
           Sir
           <br/>
           Through the medium of this letter I would like to express my anxiety about the roaming of stray animals on the road especially during the busy traffic hours.
          </p>
          <p>
           These stray animals that keep roaming on the roads also cause injury to people besides blocking traffic. Last week there was news of stray dogs and even monkeys biting people and a young man was even attacked by a stray bull. More often than not we have seen stray cows and donkeys blocking the traffic. I am sure you too have witnessed this menace. These stray animals also cause unhygienic conditions in the city by strewing the waste of garbage dumps all over. The urgent need of the hour is to stop this growing menace. Strict action should be taken against owners who allow their animals to go astray. Animal shelters should be built to provide a shelter for these stray animals. Moreover public awareness has to be created as to whom people should contact if they see stray animals on the road. If these simple steps are taken we will gradually see the number of stray animals decreasing and a great deal of our inconvenience will be reduced.
          </p>
          <p>
           I sincerely hope you will publish my letter in your esteemed newspaper so that the nuisance created by stray animals can at least be minimized.
          </p>
