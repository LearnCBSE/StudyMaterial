            </strong>
           </span>
           <br/>

            <strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
           </span>
           <br/>
           Everyone around the king was talking about Hilsa fish. This had infuriated the king so he didn’t want anyone to talk about the Hilsa fish.
          </p>
          <p>
           <span style="color: #eb4924;">

            </strong>
           </span>
           <br/>
           The king asked Gopal to buy a huge Hilsa fish from the market and to ensure that no one should talk to him about the fish on the entire way from the market to the palace.

            <strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
           </span>
           <br/>
           Gopal half-shaved his face. Smeared ash on his body himself and wore rugs before going out to buy Hilsa fish.
          </p>
          <p>
           <span style="color: #eb4924;">

             Question 4:
            </strong>
           </span>
           <br/>
           How did Gopal get inside the palace to see the king after he had bought the fish?
           <br/>
           <span style="color: #008000;">
            <strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
           </span>
           <br/>
           Gopal started singing and dancing in front of the palace at a loud voice. The king heard the noise and asked the man to be brought inside.
          </p>
          <p>
           <span style="color: #eb4924;">

           <br/>
           Explain why no one seemed to be interested in talking about the Hilsa fish which Gopal had bought.
           <br/>
           <span style="color: #008000;">
            <strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
           </span>
           <br/>
           No one was interested about the Hilsa fish. Gopal had bought because of Gopal’s condition. He was wearing rugs, his face was half-shaven and ash was smeared over his body. People were more interested in his appearance than the fish.

           Notice how in a comic book, there are no speech marks when characters talk. Instead what they say is put in a speech ‘bubble’. However, if we wish to repeat or report what they say, we must put it into reported speech.
           <br/>
           Change the following sentences in the story to reported speech. The first one has been done for you.

           When the king heard his courtiers talking about Hilsa fish, he lost his temper and warned them that they were courtiers and not fishermen. But the king soon felt guilty, looking at his nervous and humble courtier when he had rebuked. His tone changed and he said that it was the season of Hilsa and nobody could be stopped from talking about it.

           Gopal had half-shaven his face. Smeared ash over himself. Had put on rags and was looking disgraceful. She asked Gopal the reason for such weird acts. She stopped him from going out like that but Gopal told her that he was going to buy Hilsa fish. At last she concluded that Gopal had gone mad.

           Gopal was one of the wise men in the king’s court. When the king was fed up with ongoing talks about Hilsa fish he challenged Gopal.
           <br/>
           Gopal happily accepted the challenge of buying a huge Hilsa fish from the market and to ensure on the way from the market to the palace no one should talk to him about the fish.
           <br/>
           He was an intelligent man. He dressed up like a mad man and his appearance caught everyone’s attention. He reached the court without anyone talking about the fish as every one was drawn towards his appearance.

             Solution:

           </span>
           <br/>
           Gopal looked suspicious or rather mystic since he had dressed himself filthly. Moreover his beared was half-shaved and ash was smeared on it. Therefore the guards barred his entry to the palace. He started dancing and singing loudly so that the king might hear him and call him inside. The king ordered him to be taken inside but he could not recognise him.
           <br/>
           When Gopal reminded him of his challenge and proved that he had fulfilled it the king was surprised and burst into laughter.

           We should not give up in any situation. If we try hard we can definitely find a solution. Why do you think so?

           <span style="color: #008000;">

             Solution:

           </span>
           <br/>
           Yes, we should not give up in any situation. We should find out a solution to come out of it. Sometimes, it might be tough to find the solution, but if we try hard, nothing is impossible. We learn from the efforts we make in life. If we won’t make efforts then our learning will stop.
           <br/>
           It is OK to commit mistake but we should learn bur lesson from them and must not repeat them again. The world remember the great people because they did things differently and took up those risks in life.
