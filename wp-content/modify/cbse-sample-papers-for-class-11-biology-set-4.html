           Question 21.
           <br/>
           Persons suffering from very low blood pressure pass no urine. Why? What suggestion would you offer for the removal of waste products from the blood in such a situation? (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           It is true that a person suffering from very low blood pressure does not pass sufficient urine. The reason for this is, the blood to pass through the glomerulus of the nephron must have required amount of pressure in it. If the pressure is insufficient, it will not flow through the glomerulus and filtration would not take place, hence no urine would be formed. This is quite harmful to the person as waste products go on accumulating in the body.
          </p>
          <p>
           To avoid this, a person should be advised to take a sufficient amount of water and medicines to keep the blood pressure at an optimum level.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) At higher light intensities, the rate of photosynthesis becomes limiting. Light is limiting in A and 50% of B.
           <br/>
           (b) C is saturation of light. Here, the rate of photosynthesis is not increased by increasing the intensity of light.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Action spectrum indicates the relative rates of photosynthesis at different wavelengths of light. Action spectrum of photosynthesis can be plotted by measurements of oxygen evolution at different wavelengths. For example, Englemann in 1882, plotted an action spectrum using green algae.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Absorption spectrum for any substance can be derived by calculating the amount of energy at different wavelength of light absorbed.

           Question 27.
           <br/>
           (a) Why is ABA known as ‘stress hormone’? (3)
           <br/>
           (b) Mention any two functions of this hormone.
           <br/>
           (c) How are they antagonistic to gibberellins?
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Auxins are growth hormones capable of promoting cell elongation. They have been used in horticulture to promote growth, flowering and rooting.
           <br/>
           (a) Write a line to explain the meaning of the following terms related to Auxins.
           <br/>
           (i) Auxins precursors
           <br/>
           (ii) Anti-Auxins
           <br/>
           (b) What are synthetic auxins?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Abscisic acid (ABA) is also called stress hormone because the synthesis of abscissic acid is stimulated by drought, water logging and other adverse environmental conditions. It is produced in many parts of the plants but more abundantly inside the chloroplast of green cells.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Abscisic acid owes its name to its role in the abscission of plant leaves. In preparation for winter, ABA is produced in terminal buds. This slows plant growth and directs leaf primordia to develop scales to protect the dormant buds during the cold season.
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) They are antagonistic to gibberellins, as gibberellins promotes stem elongation while abscisic acid acts as growth inhibitor.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           (a)
           <br/>
           (i) Auxin precursors: These are the raw materials used in the synthesis of Auxins. For example, tryptophan is a precursor of indole-3- acetic acid.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Anti-auxins: These are the compounds which inhibit the action of auxin. For example, TIBA acts as anti-auxins by blocking the transport of auxin.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Synthetic auxin: Auxins which are manufactured synthetically and do not grow naturally in plants, e.g., 2,4-D, NAA, etc.

           Question 29.
           <br/>
           Calcium is an essential mineral for human body. It helps in blood clotting , muscle contraction, etc. Exchange of
           <br/>
           calcium between bone and extracellular fluid takes place under the influence of certain hormones . (4)
           <br/>
           (A) What will happen if more of Ca
           <sup>
            ++
           </sup>
           is in extracellular fluid?
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           What will happen if very less amount of Ca
           <sup>
            ++
           </sup>
           is in the extracellular fluid? .
           <br/>
           (b) Calcium ion concentration in blood affects muscle contraction
           <br/>
           (i) Does it lead to tetany in certain cases?
           <br/>
           (ii) How will you correlate fluctuation in blood calcium with tetany?
           <br/>
           (c) Name at least two hormones which result in fluctuation of Ca
           <sup>
            ++
           </sup>
           level.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) More calcium concentration in extracellular fluid is associated with hyperparathyroidism. It may cause demineralisation, resulting in softening and bending of the bones. This condition is known as osteoporosis.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Very less amount of calciumin extracellular fluid is associated with hypoparathyroidism. It may increase the excitability of nerves and muscles, causing cramps, sustained contraction of the muscles of larynx, face, hands and feet. This disorder is called parathyroid tetany.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) (i) Calcium plays an important role in regulation of muscle contraction. The low level of calcium in blood leads to higher level of calcium in muscles. This may result in uncontrolled contraction of muscles which is called tetany.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Parathyroid hormone secreted by parathyroid gland increases the calcium level in the blood. Due to deficiency of parathyroid hormone, the calcium level in the blood decreases. This increases the excitability of nerves and muscles, causing cramps and convulsions. Sustained contraction of the muscles of larynx, face, hands and feet are produced. This disorder is called parathyroid tetany.
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) Parathyroid and calcitonin results in fluctuation of calcium level.

           Question 32.
           <br/>
           (a) Who proposed the fluid mosaic model of plasma membrane ? (5)
           <br/>
           (b) Describe the fluid mosaic model of the plasma membrane with the help of labelled diagram.
           <br/>
           (c) Name the major interaction responsible for stabilising plasma membrane.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Plastids are small bodies, found free in the cytoplasm of most plant cells. They are absent in animal cells.
           <br/>
           (a) Is there a species specific or region specific type of plastids?
           <br/>
           (b) How does one distinguish it from the other?
           <br/>
           (c) Are the different types of plastids interchangeable? If yes, give examples where they are getting converted from one type to another.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Fluid mosaic model was proposed by Singer and Nicolson.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b)
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            According to this model, there is a central lipid bilayer of phospholipids with their polar head group towards the outside and the non-polar tails pointing inwards.
           </li>
           <li>
            Some proteins which are embedded in the lipid layer are called integral or intrinsic proteins and they cannot be separated from the membrane.
           </li>
           <li>
            There are large globular integral proteins which project beyond the lipid layer on both the sides are believed to have channels through which water-soluble materials can pass across.
           </li>
           <li>
            Superficially attached proteins are called extrinsic or peripheral proteins and can be easily removed.
           </li>
           <li>
            Some membrane lipids and integral proteins remains bound to oligosaccharides which project into the extracellular fluid and influence the manner in which cells interact with one another.
           </li>
          </ol>

           (c) Hydrophobic interactions.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           (a) Yes, plastids can be species-specific region. Plastids are present in plants cells and they are also present in some species of phylum Prostista e.g. Euglenoids.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) On the basis of pigments present in them, plastids are of the following three types:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Leucoplasts: Leucoplasts are colourless plastids. They are found in storage cells of roots, seeds and underground stems. They take part in the storage of food. Leucoplasts are of three types depending on the storage products: amyloplasts stores starch, Aleuroplasts stores protein while elaioplasts stores oil and fat.
           </li>
           <li>
            Chromoplasts: They are coloured plastids. The colour varies from red, orange, yellow etc., due to the presence of carotenoids. They are mostly found in flowers and fruits. They provide colouration to organs for attracting pollinators.
           </li>
           <li>
            Chloroplasts: Chloroplasts are green colour plastids, found in the mesophyll cells of the leaves. The green colour is due to the presence of chlorophyll. Chlorophyll traps the solar energy which is used for manufacturing food. They are the sites of photosynthesis. So, chloroplasts are the “Kitchen of the cells”.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (c) Yes, plastids are interchangeable in their form. Generally, three types of plastids are present in plant cells, i.e., leucoplasts, chromoplast and chloroplasts.
           <br/>
           Depending upon the condition and maturity stage, one type of plastid can get converted into another plastid.
           <br/>
           For example:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            In capsicum, the cells of ovary consist of leucoplasts. When ovary changes into fruit, leucoplasts are transformed into chloroplasts. When the fruit ripens, chloroplast are converted into chromoplast.
           </li>
           <li>
            In stem tubers of potato, the leucoplast, on exposure to sunlight transform into chloroplasts.
           </li>
           <li>
            In some cases, the chloroplast gets converted into chromoplast during the ripening of fruits, e.g., change of colour from green to red during the ripening of tomato and chili.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           Question 33.
           <br/>

           <br/>
           chromosomal arrangement during different phases of meiosis-II.

           <br/>
           Based on X-ray diffraction, Watson and Crick in 1953, proposed a double helical model of DNA.
          </p>
          <p>
           The model proposed that:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Each DNA molecule consists of two helical polynucleotide chains or strands.
           </li>
           <li>
            The strands run anti-parallel i.e., their 3′-5′ phosphodiester bonds are in opposite direction and the 3′ end of one strand lies besides the 5′ end of the other.
           </li>
           <li>
            In each polynucleotide chain, the phosphate molecules lie on the outer side of deoxyribose and the nitrogenous bases inward, perpendicular to the helical axis.
           </li>
           <li>
            The nitrogenous bases of two strands are linked through hydrogen bonds. Base pairing is specific. (Adenine pairs with thymine and guanine pairs with cytosine)
           </li>
           <li>
            There are two hydrogen bonds between A = T and three between G ≡ C.
           </li>
           <li>
            Length of H – bond is 3Å. Two strands are therefore complementary.
           </li>
           <li>
            One turn of helix is about 34Å and contains 10 nucleotides.
           </li>
           <li>
            The distance between the adjacent nucleotide is 3.4 Å.
           </li>
           <li>
            The diameter of helix is about 20Å.
           </li>
           <li>
            In a DNA molecule, the two complementary chains are twisted to form double helix around a common central axis.
           </li>
          </ol>
