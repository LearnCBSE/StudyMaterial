           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Have you made choices that are acceptable and less ‘risky’ or have you followed the beaten track? Why?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           I know I am a student of just above average intellect and skills. I am not extraordinary or unique. Hence, I prefer to make choices that are ‘acceptable’ and less ‘risky’. I can’t afford to be very innovative and adventurous.

           Question 5.
           <br/>
           (a) Listen to a recording of the poem.
           <br/>
           (b) What choice did the poet have to make?
           <br/>
           (c) Did he regret his choice? Why/why not?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Do it yourself.
           <br/>
           (b) The poet faced a genuine dilemma. ‘Two roads diverged in a yellow wood.’Naturally, he couldn’t travel both. He stood there in confusion which one he should leave and which one he should follow. Both of them were equally beautiful. At last, he made a choice. He left the first one for another day. He chose the other road as it was ‘grassy’ and ‘wanted wear’.
           <br/>
           (c) The poet regrets his choice. Had he chosen the other road, perhaps all his ambitions in life might have been fulfilled. Hence, he sighs with a sense of dissatisfaction.

           Question 8.
           <br/>
           Answer the following questions briefly:
           <br/>
           (i) Describe the two roads that the author comes across.
           <br/>
           (ii) Which road does the speaker choose? Why?
           <br/>
           (iii) Which road would you choose? Why?
           <br/>
           (iv) Does the speaker seem happy about his decision?
           <br/>
           (v) The poet says “I took the one less travelled by, And that has made all the difference.” What is ‘the difference’ that the poet mentions?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) The poet sees two roads diverging in a yellow wood. Perhaps it was autumn and both the roads were covered with dead or fallen yellow leaves. The first one went down in ‘the undergrowth’ of the forest. The other road was equally beautiful, grassy and ‘wanted wear’. It was less frequented by than the first.
           <br/>
           (ii) The poet had to come out of the dilemma as he couldn’t travel on both the roads at the same time. He left the first one for the other day. He chose the second road which had been less travelled by and ‘wanted wear’. It was equally fair, grassy and covered with yellow leaves.
           <br/>
           (iii) I would choose the second road. I am a young man with great ability to face challenges and adventures that come in life. The untrodden road would give me opportunities to come across several new adventures which I like the most.
           <br/>
           (iv) The speaker doesn’t seem to be happy about his decision. Whether the choice is right or wrong can’t be decided on the spur of the moment. Only after ‘ages and ages’ he will realise the mistake that he made years ago. He will be ‘telling with a sigh’ to others that it was not a wise decision. Two roads diverged in a wood and he ‘took the one less travelled by’. The roads are fascinating metaphors for life. The choice has made all the difference in his life.
           <br/>
           (v) The poet says “I took the one less travelled by, And that has made all the difference”. The difference is that he did not choose that way of life which most people generally choose to get easy success, fame and money in life. On the other hand, he chose the road that was “less travelled by”. It was certainly risky and adventurous to choose such a road. Perhaps, he means that he chose to be a poet and sacrificed other convenient traditional and more lucrative professions. To be a poet, perhaps, turned out to be a risky and adventurous choice. Perhaps he realised it ‘ages and ages’ after he had made the decision.

           The poem “ The Road Not Taken” by Robert Frost is about the
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            1.
           </span>
           that one makes in life. It tells about a man who comes to a
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            2.
           </span>
           in the road he is travelling upon. He feels
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            3.
           </span>
           that he cannot travel
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            4.
           </span>
           paths as he must choose one. Frost uses this fork in the road to represent a point in the man’s life where he has to choose the
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            5.
           </span>
           he wishes to take in life. As he thinks about his
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            6
           </span>
           . he looks down one path as far as he can see trying to
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            7.
           </span>
           what life will be like if he walks that path. He then gazes at the other and decides the outcome of going down that path would be just as
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            8.
           </span>
           At this point he concludes that the
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            9.
           </span>
           that has been less travelled on would be more
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            10.
           </span>
           when he reaches the end of it. The man then decides that he will save the other path for another day, even though he knows that one path leads to another and that he won’t get a
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            11
           </span>
           . to go back. The man then says that he will be telling this story with a sigh someday in the future suggesting that he will
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            12.
           </span>
           what life would have been like if he had chosen the more walked path even though the path he chose has made all the difference.

           Question 11.
           <br/>
           Roads are fascinating as metaphors for life, change, journeys, partings, adventure, etc. or simply as roads. This is probably why they, and all their attendant images, have permeated art, literature and song. In the poem, Frost uses the fork in the road as a metaphor for the choices we make in life. Thus the roads are, in fact, two alternative ways of life. What other nouns could be used to represent life?

           Question 13.
           <br/>
           ‘The Road Not Taken’ is a biographical poem. Therefore, some personal biographical information is relevant to the deeper understanding of the poem we have read. Go to www.encarta.com and complete the following worksheet about Robert Frost.
           <br/>
           (a) What “momentous decision” was made by Frost in 1912?
           <br/>
           (b) How old was he when he took this decision?
           <br/>
           (c) Why was it so difficult to make this decision? Think and give more than one reason.
           <br/>
           (d) Was the ‘road’ Frost had taken easy ‘to travel’?
           <br/>
           (e) Do you think he wrote “The Road Not Taken” before sailing from the USA to England or after? Can you quote a line or two from the poem that can support your answer?
           <br/>
           (f) Do you think Frost finally became popular in America as a poet?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Frost made the momentous decision of going to England from America.
           <br/>
           (b) He was 38 when he made that momentous decision.
           <br/>
           (c) It was quite difficult to take that decision because:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            He was leaving the country of his birth and going to a foreign country.
           </li>
           <li>
            He was risking to adopt a profession that was not very rewarding.
           </li>
           <li>
            He had to sell his property to go there.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (d) No, the road was not easy to travel.
           <br/>
           (e) I think Frost wrote “The Road Not Taken’ after sailing from the USA to England. The lines that prove this point are: ‘I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence.’
           <br/>
           (f) Robert Frost became very popular in the USA. He was widely read and appreciated as a poet in his lifetime.

           The poet was standing at a junction in a yellow forest where two roads separated in two different directions. The poet feels sorry that being the lonely traveller, he could not walk on both the roads at the same time. He stood there for a long time looking at the road down as far as he could. The road then bent and disappeared from his eyes in bushes and the undergrowth.

           Both the roads lay in front of the poet almost in the same condition. They were covered with the fallen leaves. And the leaves had not been blackened by the steps of the walkers. The leaves still lay there uncrushed by the steps. The poet left the first road thinking that he would use it on some other day. When he was doing so, he knew that how one way leads to another. He would go so far from the first road that he doubted if he would ever come back to walk on it.

           The poet does not seem to be very happy with his choice. Just now, it is very difficult to pass the judgement on the spur of the moment. After many years, perhaps he will be telling with a sigh that his choice was not very rewarding. There were two roads that separated in two different directions. And he chose the road which had been less travelled by. The choice was his own. And this choice has made all the difference in his life.

           Robert Frost comes across a path which diverges into two roads. One road is less trodden and full of challenges while the other is a beaten track without any difficulties. He chooses the road which is less travelled by the people, because, it is more inviting and the poet is adventurous by nature and loves to take challenges.

           <br/>
           The poem is concerned with a choice made between the two roads. The poet tells himself that he will explore one and then come back and explore the other, but he knows that he will probably be unable to do so. The poem is about something more than the choice of paths in a wood, for that choice might be relatively unimportant. We interpret his choice of a road as a symbol for any choice in life between alternatives that appear almost equally attractive. Through the years, however, we come to find that the choices we make and the paths we choose, will make a difference in our lives.

           <br/>
           The final stanza in the poem ‘The Road Not Taken’ starts ‘with a sigh’. It is a sigh of relief and satisfaction. The poet is satisfied with all that has happened in his life and the position that he is in. It is a sigh of relief that on that day he had taken the ‘road less travelled by’ and ‘that has made all the difference.’

           The two roads indicate the choices one makes in life. The poet has presented the dilemma that one goes through while taking a decision regarding one’s future. Man faces such dilemma as he is afraid of making the wrong choice which could have far reaching consequences. Man, therefore, takes a less risky and acceptable decision.

He felt like travelling both the roads because he was not sure of the outcome of his choice. He wanted to have an experience of both the situations.

The road is symbolic of the opportunities that come in our life and compel us to take the right decision. The divergence of the-road is symbolic of the dilemma we face in life when one is caught in a problem. The choices have to be made thoughtfully and wisely.Adventurous people take the less travelled path. All these choices decide their future. Their life is affected by these choices as the step once taken cannot be retraced.

           A time comes in the life of every man when he has to make a difficult and an important choice. The decision taken can prove to be wrong, but the decision has to be made as the choice made affects one’s future prospects.I too came across such a junction in my life when I had to choose between poetry and teaching in school.I gave a serious thought to each road. I was well aware of the fact that my life was affected by the choice I would make because the step once taken cannot be retraced. Finally, I chose the less travelled path as I am adventurous by nature and also because I want to be different horn others.I took the risk of shifting my family to England to promote my professional interest.I am grateful to God that my choice was right. I employed traditional patterns to write poems. Today, I stand out in the crowd.I am among one of tire country’s best loved poets. I am a well known and an acknowledged poet today.
           <br/>
           With lots of love,
           <br/>

           The poet is in an indecisive state. He is assailed by doubts concerning his choice.He is well aware of the fact that if his choice turns out to be misplaced, there will be no going back. He also has a feeling that his choice might be crowned with success. ,
           <br/>
           The unknown is not always a risky business. It might open the door to success too, as it happened in the case of the poet himself. Being adventurous by nature, he decides to plunge into the unknown.He seems happy about the decision as taking risk is a part of his nature.

           <br/>
           Everyone comes across a problem in life in which he has to take a decision which can change his life.The decision can prove to be wrong as its impact on our future is unpredictable. Consequences of wrong choices will have to be faced by the person himself. Nonetheless, the decision has to be taken.It is not always a risky business.The choice may be crowned with success too as it happened in the case of the poet himself.
           <br/>
           The poet, once, came across a junction when his path diverged into two.He wanted to experience both the situations, but the decision had to be made. It was ultimately his choice of that particular road which changed his life.The poet adopted the less travelled path, faced problems but later achieved both success and fame not only in England, but in America too.
           <br/>
           One cannot get everything in life.He has to take a decision and stick to it.Tough decisions make him stand out in the crowd. We should accept challenges and be ready to take risks in order to succeed in life.

           Dear Diary
           <br/>
           In every person’s life there comes a point of time when he has to make a choice. Such a time came in my life too.I was in a dilemma as to what I should do. People generally take the much travelled path as it is tried and tested. However, there was another path that I could take on which hone had travelled. There would be difficulties and problems and risks. Maybe it would not be the right choice, but it appealed to me more, as if it was waiting to be tried.I decided to keep the first one for another day, knowing well that I might not ever come back. I have made a decision, how it will turn out, nobody knows.In the evening of my life, I will be telling this story to someone. It is difficult to forecast whether I will be happy or full of regret at the choice I have made. Well, only time will decide.
           <br/>
           Good night.

           <br/>
           The serious conflict in this poem is the choice that one often comes across in his lifetime.Man gets many opportunities in life. He gets an opportunity to choose between them.The decision that he has to take is important as it can change his whole life. He can’t retrace his steps once he starts moving on the path he has taken.So, one must make a choice after weighing the pros and cons of the opportunities that life shows in one’s path.It is none the less important to stick to the decision once taken. Risks involved will help him stand out in the crowd.
