           Law of Motion Class 11 Notes Physics Chapter 5

          <p>
           <strong>
            • Dynamics
           </strong>
           is the branch of physics in which we study the motion of a body by taking into consideration the cause i.e., force which produces the motion.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            • Force
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Force is an external cause in the form of push or pull, which produces or tries to produce motion in a body at rest, or stops/tries to stop a moving body or changes/tries to change the direction of motion of the body.
           <br/>
           • The inherent property, with which a body resists any change in its state of motion is called inertia. Heavier the body, the inertia is more and lighter the body, lesser the inertia.
           <br/>
           • Law of inertia states that a body has the inability to change its state of rest or uniform motion (i.e., a motion with constant velocity) or direction of motion by itself.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            • Newton’s Laws of Motion
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Law 1.
           </strong>
           A body will remain at rest or continue to move with uniform velocity unless an external force is applied to it.
           <br/>
           First law of motion is also referred to as the ‘Law of inertia’. It defines inertia, force and inertial frame of reference.
           <br/>
           I here is always a need of ‘frame of reference’ to describe and understand the motion of particle, lhc simplest ‘frame of reference’ used are known as the inertial frames.
           <br/>
           A frame of referent, e is known as an inertial frame it, within it, all accelerations of any particle are caused by the action of ‘real forces’ on that particle.
           <br/>
           When we talk about accelerations produced by ‘fictitious’ or ‘pseudo’ forces, the frame of reference is a non-inertial one.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Law 2.
           </strong>
           When an external force is applied to a body of constant mass the force produces an acceleration, which is directly proportional to the force and inversely proportional to the mass of the body.

           <strong>
            Law 3.
           </strong>
           “To every action there is equal and opposite reaction force”. When a body A exerts a force on another body B, B exerts an equal and opposite force on A.

            • Linear Momentum
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The linear momentum of a body is defined as the product of the mass of the body and its velocity.

            • Impulse
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Forces acting for short duration are called impulsive forces. Impulse is defined as the product of force and the small time interval for which it acts. It is given by
           <br/>

           <br/>
           Impulse of a force is a vector quantity and its SI unit is 1 Nm.
           <br/>
           — If force of an impulse is changing with time, then the impulse is measured by finding the area bound by force-time graph for that force.
           <br/>
           — Impulse of a force for a given time is equal to the total change in momentum of the body during the given time. Thus, we have

           <strong>
            • Law of Conservation of Momentum
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The total momentum of an isolated system of particles is conserved.
           <br/>
           In other words, when no external force is applied to the system, its total momentum remains constant.
           <br/>

           <strong>
            • Concurrent Forces and Equilibrium
           </strong>
           <br/>
           “A group of forces which are acting at one point are called concurrent forces.”
           <br/>
           Concurrent forces are said to be in equilibrium if there is no change in the position of rest or the state of uniform motion of the body on which these concurrent forces are acting.
           <br/>
           For concurrent forces to be in equilibrium, their resultant force must be zero. In case of three concurrent forces acting in a plane, the body will be in equilibrium if these three forces may be completely represented by three sides of a triangle taken in order. If number of concurrent forces is more than three, then these forces must be represented by sides of a closed polygon in order for equilibrium.
           <br/>

           <strong>
            • Commonly Used Forces
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (i) Weight of a body.
           </strong>
           It is the force with which earth attracts a body towards its centre. If M is mass of body and g is acceleration due to gravity, weight of the body is Mg in vertically downward direction.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (ii) Normal Force.
           </strong>
           If two bodies are in contact a contact force arises, if the surface is smooth the direction of force is normal to the plane of contact. We call this force as Normal force.
           <br/>
           <img alt="Law of Motion Class 11 Notes Physics Chapter 5 img-10" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-138043" height="137" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Law-of-Motion-Class-11-Notes-Physics-Chapter-5-img-10.png" width="229"/>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Example.
           </strong>
           Let us consider a book resting on the table. It is acted upon by its weight in vertically downward direction and is at rest. It means there is another force acting on the block in opposite direction, which balances its weight. This force is provided by the table and we call it as normal force.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (iii) Tension in string.
           </strong>
           Suppose a block is hanging from a string. Weight of the block is acting vertically downward but it is not moving, hence its weight is balanced by a force due to string. This force is called ‘Tension in string’. Tension is a force in a stretched string. Its direction is taken along the string and away from the body under consideration.

            • Motion in a Vertical Circle
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The motion of a particle in a horizontal circle is different from the motion in vertical circle. In horizontal circle, the motion is not effected by the acceleration due to gravity (g) whereas in the motion of vertical circle, the motion is not effected by the acceleration due to gravity (g) whereas in the motion of vertical circle, the value of ‘g’ plays an important role, the motion in this case does not remain uniform. When the particle move up from its lowest position P, its speed continuously decreases till it reaches the highest point of its circular path. This is due to the work done against the force of gravity. When the particle moves down the circle, its speed would keep on increasing.
