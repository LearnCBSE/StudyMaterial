           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Association of Southeast Asian Nations or ASEAN was established on 8 August 1967 in Bangkok by the five original member countries, namely, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand.
           <br/>
           The aims and purposes of the Association are :
           <br/>
           (i) To accelerate the economic growth, social progress and cultural development in the region through joint endeavors in the spirit of equality and partnership, in order to strengthen the foundation for a prosperous and peaceful community7 of Southeast Asian nations.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) To promote regional peace and stability through justice and the rule of law in the relationship among countries in the region. Adherence to the principles of the United Nations Charter.

           <br/>
           Explain any two points of conflict between India and Bangladesh. [4]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Illegal migration: Illegal migration is one of the bones of contention between these two countries, since the 1971 war of independence that created the state of Bangladesh, millions of Bangladeshi immigrants (the vast majority of them illegal) have poured into neighbouring India. While the Indian government has tried to deport some of these immigrants as well as the porous border between the two countries, has made such an enterprise impossible.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Water disputes: Sharing of Ganges water is another one of the sources of conflict between India and Bangladesh. This conflict between two countries arose when India decided to construct Farakka barrage to divert water from Ganges to Hoogly River (in India).

           Question 25.
           <br/>
           As decided by the member states in 2005, highlight any four steps to make the United Nations more relevant in the changing context. [4]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Security council reform: A very frequent discussion is to change the permanent membership of the UN Security Council, which reflects the power structure of the world as it was in 1945.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) UN secretariat-transparency reform: At another level, calls for reforming the UN demand to make the UN administration more transparent, more accountable, and more efficient, including direct election of the Secretary-General by the people.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Democracy reform: Another frequent demand is that the UN becomes “more democratic”, and a key institution of the world democracy. This raises fundamental questions about the nature and role of the UN. The UN does not govern the world, it is rather a forum for the world’s sovereign states to debate on issues and determine collective courses of action.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) Human rights reform: The United Nations Commission on Human Rights came under fire during its existence for the high-profile positions. It gave to member states that did not guarantee the human rights of their own citizens. Several nations known to have been guilty of gross violations of human rights became members of the organization, such as Libya, Cuba etc.

           Question 26.
           <br/>
           Mention any four political consequences of globalization. [4]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) One of the major impacts of political globalisation is that it reduces the importance of nation-states. Many states have organized themselves into trade blocs. Emergence of supranational institutions such as the European Union, the WTO, the G-8, and the International Criminal Court etc. replaced or extended the national functions to facilitate international agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Another major impact of globalisation is the increased influence of Non-Government Organizations in public policy like humanitarian aid, developmental efforts etc. Many organizations have come forward with the mission of uplifting the most unprivileged societies of the world where there is massive funding of millions of dollars.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) United States intervened in many Middle East Asian countries recently. The whole idea was on extracting oil mines for which they took the economic, political, social and cultural control of these oil-rich countries.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) The rise of global civil society is one of the major contributions of globalization. The multivariate groups make up civil society which often protests against capitalism.

          <ul>
           <li>
            Compared to the traditional seeds, the HYV seeds promised to produce much greater amounts of grain on a single plant. As a result, the same piece of land would now produce far larger quantities of food grains than that was possible earlier.
           </li>
           <li>
            Increase in agriculture production.
           </li>

           Explain any two reasons for the popularity of Indira Gandhi during 1971 election. [4]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In 1971 general elections Indira Gandhi came up with different strategies. She put forward the slogan of Garibi Hatao (remove poverty) for which she focused on the growth of the public sector, imposition of ceiling on rural land holding and urban property, removal of disparities in income and opportunity, and abolition of princely privileges. She vigorously campaigned for implementing the existing land reform law and undertook further steps land ceiling as one of the major objective of her campaign. The slogan of garibi hatao and the programmes that followed it were part of Indira Gandhi’s political strategy of building an independent nation-wide political support base, in contrast to the weak irrelevant strategies of other parties made Indira Gandhi’s government popular.

           Question 31.
           <br/>
           What was Cuban Missile Crisis? Describe its main events. [6]
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Explain any three reasons for the disintegration of the USSR.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Cuban Missile Crisis known as the October Crisis scare in Cuba was a 13-day confrontation in October 1962 between Soviet Union and Cuba on one side and the United States on the other side. The crisis is generally regarded as the moment in which the Cold War came closest to only turn into a nuclear conflict.
          </p>
          <p>
           Since Cuba was an ally of Soviet Union and received both diplomatic and financial aid from it, Nikita Khrushchev, the leader of Soviet Union, decided to convert Cuba into a Russian base. In 1962 he placed nuclear missiles in Cuba. The installation of these weapons put the US, for the first time, under fire from close range.
          </p>
          <p>
           Three weeks later, the Soviet Union had placed the nuclear weapons in Cuba, America became aware of it. The US President John F. Kennedy and its advisers were reluctant to do any thing that would lead to a full-scale war but he soon determined to get Khrushchev to remove the missiles from Cuba. Kennedy ordered American warships to intercept any Soviet ships heading to Cuba as a way of warning the USSR of his seriousness. A clash seemed imminent in what came to be known as Cuban Missile Crisis.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           (i) Stagnating economy: The Soviet Union had grown to a size large enough to have continued state planning. The massive and intricate Soviet economy became too large to manage by state planners, who were unwilling to enable more autonomy at a mid-managerial level to remain responsive down to a localized level. This resulted in failed economic policies (failure to respond timely to continuous changes), while thwarting innovation.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The soviet union had become stagnant in an administrative and political sense as well. The communist party that had ruled the Soviet Union for over 70 years was not accountable to the people. Ordinary people were alienated by slow and stifling administration, corruption, the inability of the system to correct mistakes it had made and the centralisation of authority in a host land and hence people did not identify with the system and its rulers and the govt, increasingly lost popular backing.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Local Nationalism: With declining public perception of the Soviet government (due to political blunders), nationalism grew within each of the individual republics, creating independence ambitions in republics such as Ukraine, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.

          <p>
           Question 32.
           <br/>
           Explain the concept of “Common but differentiated responsibilities. How and where was it emphasized upon? [6]
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Explain any three benefits of globalization with examples.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibility (CBDR) is one of the cornerstones of Sustainable development. It has emerged as a principle of International Environmental Law and has been explicitly formulated in the context of the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. It finds its origin in equity7 considerations and equity principles in international law. It is in congruence with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol.
          </p>
          <p>
           The CBDR has two matrices. The first is the common responsibility, which arises from the concept of common heritage and common concern of humankind, and reflects the duty of states towards equally sharing the burden of environmental protection for common resources; the second is the differentiated responsibility, which addresses substantive equality unequal material, social and economic situations arise across states different countries make different historical contributions to global environmental problems; and possess financial, technological and structural capacity to tackle those global problems. In this sense, the principle establishes a conceptual framework for an equitable allocation of the costs of global environmental protection.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Globalisation increases economic growth and generates a wider range of products and services. Economies that are developing globally have more economic growth than established economies, demonstrating. globalisation’s benefits for developing regions.
          </p>
          <p>
           Globalisation can help create capitalistic and democratic political systems. Foreign exchange allows more products and services to be available, simultaneously lowering the costs, because of specialization. In respect to Utilitarianism, or the pursuit of the greatest utility for the largest number of people the tendency for data points is to group together in a meaningful way.
          </p>
          <p>
           From 1962 to 1989, South Korea’s GDP growth averaged over 8% year-on-year. Exports and international trade grew enormously, along with the purchasing power of South Korean individuals, supporting the argument that international exchange creates opportunities for developing countries. This idea also supports the way South Korea’s economy began specializing in order to grow more competitive in the global world.

           Question 33.
           <br/>
           What forced the Union Government of India to appoint the States Reorganization Commission in 1953? Mention its two main recommendations. Name any four new states formed after 1956. [6]

           Describe the various steps taken to hold the first general elections in India. How far were these elections successful?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The States Reorganization Commission (SRC) was a body constituted by the Central Government of India in 1953 to recommend the reorganization of state boundaries. In 1955, after nearly 2 years of study, the commission recommended that India’s state boundaries should be reorganized to form 16 states and 3 union territories.
          </p>
          <p>
           One of the proposals was to reorganize the state on the basis of languages of India. This would make administration easier, and would help replace the caste and religion-based identities with less controversial linguistic identities. Earlier in 1920, the members of the Indian National Congress had agreed on the linguistic reorganisation of the Indian states as one of the party’s political goals. As the memories of partition were fresh it was feared that the division on the basis of language might further lead to division of India.
          </p>
          <p>
           By 1952, the demand for creation of a Telugu majority state in the parts of the Madras State had become powerful. Potti Sriramulu, one of the activists demanding the formation of a Telugu- majority state, died on 16 December 1952 after undertaking a fast-unto-death. Subsequently, the Telugu-majority Andhra State was formed in 1953. This sparked off agitations all over the country, with linguistic groups demanding separate statehoods.
           <br/>
           In order to reorganize the states, the government of India constituted the State Reorganization Commission (SRC) under the chairmanship of Fazal Ali, a former Court judge.
           <br/>
           States formed after 1956 are :

           The Indian General Election of 1951-52 elected the first Lok Sabha after India gained Independence in August 1947. Until this point, the Indian Constituent Assembly had served as an interim legislature. The Indian National Congress (INC) won a landslide victory. Jawaharlal Nehru became the first democratically elected Prime Minister of the country. Organization of the elections was a humongous task. There was a house-to-house survey to register the voters. With over 70 percent of the voters being illiterate, the candidates were to be identified by symbols, assigned to each major party and independent candidates, painted oil the ballot-boxes. Over 2,24,000 polling booths, one for almost every 1000 voters, were constructed and equipped with steel ballot-boxes, one box for every candidate. Nearly 620,000,000 ballot papers were printed. About a million officials supervised the conduct of the polls. Of the many candidates, whoever gained, or the largest number of votes was to be elected. It was necessary for the winning candidate to have a majority.

           Question 34.
           <br/>
           Examine the three main reasons responsible for the split of the Congress Party during 1969. [6]
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Evaluate any three consequences of the emergency imposed in 1975.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Three causes of the split in the congress party in 1969:
           <br/>
           (i) Differences with the syndicate: After the 1967 elections, PM Indira Gandhi had to deal with the Syndicate, a group of powerful and influential leaders from within the congress, who had played a major role in her election as the leader of the party. These leaders expected her to follow their advice. However, Indira Gandhi gradually attempted to strengthen her position and carefully sidelined the Syndicate. Their rivalry came in the open in 1969 over the presidential elections following President Zakir Hussain’s death and also differences over the reforms introduced by Indira Gandhi.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Presidential Elections 1969: Following president Zakir Hussain death, the post of the president of India fell vacant in 1969. Respite Mrs. Gandhi’s reservations, the ‘Syndicate’ nominated her long-time opponent, N. Sanjeeva Reddy as the official congress candidate. Indira Gandhi retaliated by encouraging Vice-President V. V. Giri to file his nomination as an independent candidate. The defeat of N. Sanjeeva Reddy formalized the split in the party into Congress (organisation) and that led by Indira Gandhi as Congress (Requisitionists).
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Reforms by Indira Gandhi: Revolutionary steps taken by Indira Gandhi were not welcomed by the Congress leaders. She had launched a series of initiatives like public distribution of food grains, land reforms, nationalisation of fourteen private banks and abolition of the ‘Privy Purse’ or the special privileges given to former princes. Her policies were opposed by Morarji Desai and older leaders, too, had serious reservations about this left programme.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Any three consequences of the emergency imposed in 1975 :
           <br/>
           (a) Effects on civil liberties of citizens: The government made large scale arrests under preventive detention. Arrested people could not challenge the arrest and the government claimed it unnecessary to inform the accused of the ground on which they were detained.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Impact on Relationship with Parliament and Judiciary: The parliament brought in many changes in the constitution declaring that the election of PM, President, and Vice President could not be challenged in court. The 42
           <sup>
            nd
           </sup>
           amendment was also passed to bring in a series of changes in the constitution. It was proved that the government could take away citizens right to life and liberty by overruling courts during an emergency.

           <br/>
           The Assam movement from 1979 to 1985 is the best example of such movements against Outsiders. The Assamese suspected that there were huge numbers of illegal Bengali Muslim Settlers from Bangladesh. They felt that unless these foreign nationalists are detected and deported, they would reduce the indigenous Assamese into a minority. There were other economic issues too. There was widespread poverty and unemployment in Assam despite the existence of natural resources like oil, tea and coal. It was felt that these were drained out of the state without any commensurate benefit to the people.
           <br/>
           (i) Name the group that led the movement against outsiders in 1979.
           <br/>

           (ii) The Assamese suspected that there are huge number of illegal Bengali Muslim setders from Bangladesh. They felt that unless these foreign nationalists are detected and deported, they would reduce the indigenous assamese into a minority.
           <br/>
           (iii) There was widespread poverty and un-employment in Assam. The indigenous people were unable to secure jobs and earn their livelihoods. The nationalists only brought more problems.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>

           Explain the reasons for the students’ movement of 1974 in Bihar and role played by Jaya Prakash Narain in this movement. [4]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) In March 1974 students came together in Bihar to protest against rising prices, food scarcity, unemployment and corruption. They invited Jaya Prakash Narayan (JP), who had given up active politics and was involved in social work, to lead the student movement. Thus the students’ movement assumed a political character and had national appeal. People from all walks of life now entered the movement.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Jaya Prakash Narayan demanded the dismissal of the Congress government in Bihar and gave a call for total revolution in the- social, economic and political spheres in order to establish what he considered to be true democracy.
          </p>
          <p>

           <br/>
           Explain any three challenges faced by India at the time of its independence. [3 × 2 = 6]
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           “For a long time, Congress Party had been a social and ideological coalition.” Justify the statement.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Broadly, Independent India faced three kinds of challenges. The first and immediate challenge was to shape a nation that was united, yet accommodative of the diversity in our society. India was a land of continental size and diversify. Its people spoke different languages and followed different cultures and religions. At that time, it was widely believed that a country full of such kinds of diversity could not remain together for long. The partition of the country appeared to prove everyone’s worst fears. There were serious questions about the future of India: Would India survive as a united country? Would it do so by emphasizing national unity at the cost of every other objective? Would it mean rejecting all regional and sub-national identities? And there was an urgent question How was integration of the territory of India to be achieved?
          </p>
          <p>
           The second challenge was to establish democracy. The Constitution granted fundamental rights and extended the right to vote to every citizen. India adopted representative democracy based on the Parliamentary form of government. These features ensure that the political competition would take place in a democratic framework. A democratic constitution is necessary but not sufficient for establishing a democracy. The challenge was to develop democratic practices in accordance with the Constitution.
          </p>
          <p>
           The third challenge was to ensure the development and well-being of the entire society without any prejudices. Here again the Constitution clearly laid down the principle of equality and special protection to socially disadvantaged groups and religious and cultural communities. The Constitution also set out in the Directive Principles of State Policy—the welfare goals that democratic politics must achieve. The real challenge was now to evolve effective policies for economic development and eradication of poverty.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           The Congress Party evolved from its origins in 1885 as a pressure group for the newly educated, professional and commercial classes to a mass movement in the twentieth century. This laid the basis for its eventual transformation into a mass political party and its subsequent domination of the political system. Thus the Congress began as a party dominated by the English speaking, upper caste, upper middle-class and urban elite. But with every Civil Disobedience movement it launched, its social base widened. It brought together diverse groups, whose interests were often contradictory. Peasants and industrialists, urban dwellers and villagers, workers and owners, middle, lower and upper classes and castes, all found space in the Congress. Gradually, its leadership also expanded beyond the upper caste and upper class professionals to agriculture based leaders with a rural orientation.
          </p>
          <p>
           By the time of Independence, the Congress was transformed into a rainbow like social coalition broadly representing India’s diversity in terms of classes and castes, religions and languages and various interests. In this sense, the Congress was an ideological coalition as well. It accommodated the revolutionary and pacifist, conservative and radical, extremist and moderate and the right, left and all shades of the centre. The Congress was a ‘platform’ for numerous groups, interests and even political parties to take part in the national movement.

            The social dominance of the military, clergy and landowning aristocracy has led to the frequent overthrow of elected governments and the establishment of the military government.
           </li>
           <li>

           Answer:
           <br/>
           According to the ‘two-nation theory’ advanced by the Muslim League, India consisted of two ‘factions’, Hindus and Muslims. That is why it demanded Pakistan; a separate country for the Muslims. Thus it was decided that what was till then known as ‘India’ would be divided into two countries, ‘India’ and ‘Pakistan’.
