           Unseen Passage for Class 6 | Passage 1
          </h3>
          <p>
           The giraffe is the tallest of all living land animals. A male can go up to 18 feet and a female up to 15 feet. Such height enables them to escape the competition for ground level grass that exists among other leaf-eaters. It also gives him a long range of vision. He takes the warning of the approaching enemy early.
          </p>
          <p>
           Giraffes eat a variety of leaves, but acacia leaves are their favourite diet. In spring when many trees are not in leaf, they spend 80 per cent of the day eating. In summer, when trees are in full leaf, they need only 15 per cent. The rest of the time is spent in resting and quarreling.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           A giraffe’s long neck is made up like that of man and most other mammals, of only seven vertebrae. The bones are attached to one another with ball and socket joints. These make the neck flexible. It can run at 50 km per hour.
          </p>
          <p>
           Rising from a lying position is a problem for such a large animal. So it usually keeps standing even while it sleeps.
          </p>
          <p>
           To reach water with such a long neck and legs, a giraffe spreads its front legs wide apart. Then it lowers its neck to drink. This awkward position makes it easy for the lion to attack it.

           Using ‘ear’ phones while driving can be far more dangerous than driving under the influence of liquor.
          </p>
          <p>
           Latest research says drivers using these mobile phones as a means of faster day-today communications may be heading for an accident. The study has shattered the common belief that drinking is the chief cause of the majority of road mishaps. Talking on mobile phones increases the risk to one’s life compared to driving after being drunk. The findings of the study are based on the survey of several cases of road accidents.
          </p>
          <p>
           In fact, a study of the records of drivers involved in 699 such mistakes showed that the risk of accident for those who talk on phone while driving was at least four times higher compared to those driving in a state of drunkenness.
          </p>
          <p>
           The only advantage for those driving with cellular phone was that they could summon immediate help through these phones. The study which is relevant for the entire world is relevant for India as well. Here too these phones are being used increasingly for communication and business transactions.

           Unseen Passage for Class 6 | Passage 3
          </h3>
          <p>
           A myth has been built around the pelican, one of the oldest surviving birds. It is a commonly held belief that the mother feeds her chicks on her own blood. So people have regarded the pelican as most affectionate and dutiful bird.
          </p>
          <p>
           The large bill of the bird makes it very easy to recognize it. It has a short tail, short legs, long wings and a large bag under its bill. Because of its webbed toes, the pelican finds walking on the land difficult.
          </p>
          <p>
           However, it is a delight to watch these birds in flight. The pelican has figured among the largest of birds. It has a wing span of up to 2.75 meters, and weighs between 4.5 and 11 kg. It lives in places with a moderate climate. It migrates to India, Africa and Iran in winter because its wings do not give sufficient protection against the cold. The brown pelican is the smallest of the pelicans. It dives its head long into water from quite a height to get at its prey. The other six species of pelicans have a white plumage.
          </p>
          <p>
           Pelicans are very sociable birds. They travel, rest, nest and even fish together. The young pelicans take wing when they are about two months old. The nests of pelicans are far from the source of any food. Therefore, the adults have to fly great distances to get food.

            A volcano is a burning mountain with a great hole running deep into the earth. Out of it come smoke, gases and stones. The mouth of the opening is called the crater of the volcano.
           </span>
          </p>
          <p>
           <span style="color: black;">
            Volcanoes are not always burning. Sometimes a volcano will remain quiet for centuries. And then it will suddenly become active. This is called volcanic eruption.
           </span>
          </p>
          <p>
           <span style="color: black;">
            When the eruption takes place, great clouds of ashes, dust, gas and steam rise from the crater. Loud noises come from the crater. After sometime, white hot molten rock, called lava begins to flow down the mountain sides. This may go on for days or weeks. Then the volcano will ‘go to sleep’ again for many years. Most volcanoes are found near the seas.

            What causes the monsoon?
           </strong>
           The monsoon, which is essentially the seasonal reversal in wind direction, causes most of the rainfall received in India and some other parts of the world. The primary cause of monsoons is the difference between annual temperature trends over land and sea. The apparent position of the Sun with reference to the Earth oscillates from the Tropic of Cancer to the Tropic of Capricorn. Thus the low pressure region created by solar heating also changes latitude. The northeast and southeast trade winds converge in this low pressure zone, which is also known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone or ITCZ. This low pressure region sees continuous rise of moist wind from the sea surface to the upper layers of the atmosphere, where the cooling means the air can no longer hold so much moisture resulting in precipitation. The rainy seasons of East Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, Australia and the southern part of North America coincide with the shift of ITCZ towards these regions.

           Unseen Passage for Class 6 | Passage 9
          </h3>
          <p>
           Garbage is a great environment hazard. It comes from various sources—used paper, tiffin packings, plastic bags, ice-cream wrappers, bottle caps, fallen leaves from trees and many more. Garbage makes the premises ugly, unkempt and breeds diseases. A lot of trash that is thrown away contains material that can be recycled and reused such as paper, metals and glass which can be sent to the nearest recycling centre or disposed of to the junk dealer. It also contains organic matter such as leaves which can enrich soil fertility. A compost pit can be made at a convenient location where the refuse can be placed with layers of soil and an occasional sprinkling of water. This would help decomposition to make valuable fertilizer. This would also prevent pollution that is usually caused by burning such organic waste.
