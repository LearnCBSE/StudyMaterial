          </p>
          <p>
           Question 1:
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below and answer the questions/complete the statements that follow:
           <br/>
           Chocolate diamonds are actually brown diamonds and compared to the well- known white diamond they aren’t much worth. Diamonds are produced in mines. The best known diamond mines are in Australia, South Africa and Russia. The largest diamond mine was discovered in 1976 in the desert of Australia near a little creek named Lake Argyle. Diamonds are created under very extreme conditions of pressure and high temperature. It is a general misunderstanding that there exist only white colourless diamonds. Actually, diamonds exist in many different colours.
           <br/>
           Of all the diamond mines in the world, almost 80% of all diamonds produced are brownish in colour. Because they were found in such large quantities compared to the other coloured diamonds, they were considered as low-valued diamonds, only good for the industrial sector. But, a famous man called Le Vian came with a marketing campaign to increase the popularity of the chocolate diamond. Instead of calling it a brown diamond, he gave it popular names like caramel, chocolate, cinnamon and cognac. Since his marketing campaign, chocolate diamonds are becoming very popular.
          </p>
          <p>
           The value of a diamond is based on its shape, brightness and colour. Because white diamonds are rare, their value is based on the fact that there are not many white diamonds around. But if you look at the shape and brightness, then the brightest diamond in this world known to men is a brown diamond. Before the development of the Argyle Diamond Mine in Australia in 1986, most brown diamonds were considered, worthless for jewellery; they were not even assessed on the diamond colour scale, and were predominantly used for industrial purposes.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           However, marketing strategies changed in the 1980s and brown diamonds have become popular gems. The change was mostly due to the supply: the Argyle mine, with its 35 million carats (7,000 kg) of diamonds per year, makes about one third of global production of natural diamonds; 80% of Argyle diamonds are brown. The percentage of brown diamonds is lower in other mines, but it is almost always a significant part of the total production. Consequently, scientific research on causes of brown colour in diamond and ways to alter it has intensified.

           Question 2:
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow:
           <br/>
           Su means number and Doku means single. The game of Sudoku has many similarities with the game of life. Sudoku is a puzzle game designed for a single player, much like a crossword puzzle. The puzzle itself is nothing more than a grid of little boxes called “cells”. They are stacked nine high and nine wide, making 81 cells total.
          </p>
          <p>
           The roots of the Sudoku puzzle are in the Switzerland. Leonhard Euler created “carre latin” in the 18th century which is similar to a Sudoku puzzle. The first real Sudoku was published in 1979 and was invented by Howard Gams, an American architect. The real world wide popularity started in Japan in 1986 after it was published and given the name Sudoku by Nikoli.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           In life, too, you start with a given set of notions and then work from there on. In Sudoku, you need to follow a set of rules to build up the grid, filling each row, column and box with numbers ranging from one to nine, so much like in life where you have to go on your way without hurting anyone else. Respect every number (person), and things would be fine.
          </p>
          <p>
           While playing, you never think of the end (the result); you just keep working on the numbers and the final result (fruits of action) comes on its own. Extremely difficult puzzles may take hours. Similarly, to achieve desired results in life may take years. The game of Sudoku and the game of life are best played in calm but in a focused state.
          </p>
          <p>
           Everything has to go together in a Sudoku grid: the rows, columns and squares. Exactly as in life. Your duties towards your family, teachers, society and country all go on simultaneously. In Sudoku, the arrangement of the given numbers is symmetrical. This is instructive in life, on how to maintain steadfast faith, poise and equanimity despite situations when everything turns topsy- turvy.
          </p>
          <p>
           There is a subtle difference between the two as well. Make a mistake and you can erase it and begin all over again in Sudoku. Not so in life. You can learn a lesson through it, and avoid making the same mistake in future.
           <br/>
           (a) What is Sudoku?
           <br/>
           (b) How has the writer compared the numbers in Sudoku to life?
           <br/>
           (c) What is the similarity between Sudoku and Life?
           <br/>
           (d) How do we achieve the desired result?
           <br/>
           (e) What is meant by ’instructive ’? (Para 4)
           <br/>
           (f) What is meant by ’equanimity’? (Para 4)
           <br/>
           (g) Find the word opposite in meaning to ’obvious ’. (Para 5)
           <br/>
           (h) Find the word opposite in meaning to ’ruffled ’. (Para 3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Sudoku is a puzzle game designed for a single player, much like a crossword puzzle. The puzzle is a grid of little boxes called “cells.”
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) The writer compares the numbers in Sudoku to life by citing similarities between the game’s rules and real life situations.

           Dear Diary,
           <br/>
           These days, speaking in English has become the need of the hour. Nobody can deny this fact. Even my parents also agree with it. But they are unable to do so. Though it is not their fault or any weakness for which they should feel shy in the modern world, yet I have a keen desire to teach them to speak in English. This language is a link language with the outer world as it is an international language-a handy means of communication with the people around the world. I shall help them in this so that they will feel more confident. First, I’ll give them lesson in writing, then shall proceed to introductory dialogue speaking and will gradually move to small speeches on the topics of their interest. I am sure my genius parents will be, at the earliest, able to talk and express in English independently.
           <br/>
           Good Night

           What do the two roads symbolize in the passage 1 ? What is the significance of choosing a road?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Our grand parents lived during the years of 1950s to 1970s. At that time life was very simple yet tough. They had time to explore the surroundings and the world. They had parks to play with less of pollution around them. Mechanical gadgets were there, but were used only for necessary activities. There were rivers where they could go for picnics and treks, without the fear of being getting any allergy. The school was more of a fun place where they met their friends. They studied but were not competing against each other. For them togetherness was important rather than competition. In today’s world we are competing against our friends. We have all the facilities of life but we do not have time for our family and friends. We like to play but on computers and play station rather than with our sibilings and friends.

          <p>
           OR
          </p>
          <p>
           The two roads that the poet-traveller faces in his walk or journey are symbolic of the choices that we have to encounter in our life. The journey or a simple walk itself is a metaphor for the great journey of life. Whether one should adopt the way of spiritualism or materialism. In the poem the poet, after prolonged thought, decides to take the road less travelled, road which is the road of spiritualism accepting its challenges and uncertainties. The decision is final and irreversible and it has its own consequences, may be positive or negative. In real life also we confront such critical situations where we face life-altering options. The decision we make is crucial. We should contemplate over the choices before and then decide our priorities. Once, We make the decision and proceed accordingly, we can never reverse it. The life takes its own course, and it does not give a second chance to alter our decision and change our course of life. Hence, decide wisely.

           The emperor of Lilliput became a good friend of Gulliver and he told him about the Blefuscan attack on Lilliput. His secretary sought Gullivers help to which Gulliver agreed. He devised a plan | and ordered fifty metal hooks. Then he fastened them to a piece of strong rope. Carrying the rope and the hooks he swam to Blefuscu. The Blefuscans got frightened of him and jumped out of their ships to swim to the beach. Gulliver used one hook for each ship and tied all the ropes together. The Blefuscans army shot arrows at him to scare him away but of no use. Of course, the arrows hurt him and caused him pain also but, they did not deter his spirit and he kept on doing his work. He captured the enemy fleet and started walking through the waves, pulling all the enemy’s warships behind him. The enemies made terrible cries but Gulliver kept on pulling the warships and reached Lilliput safely.

           The queen of Brobdingnag is very generous to Gulliver. Gulliver was also delighted in her company. The queen feels pleasure with the beauty and smartness of Gulliver.
           <br/>
           This was the reason why she buys him for 1000 pieces of gold from the farmer.
           <br/>
           Gulliver speaks very high about her and appreciates her kindness as he has experienced uncountable hardships .and difficulties at the farmer’s house who used to show him in public for money when he is presented before the queen, he shows his usual fawning love for royalty by kissing the tip of her little finger. Gulliver has no limit of words to praise her and calls her full of ’infinite’ wit and humour. Though it seems to be a flattery on Gulliver’s part. The queen in considerate and asks him to live at court. She does not consider him to be simply a pet. She is a powerful person but of a pleasant personality.

           Harris felt George never came and helped his friends. He never took a day’s holiday and joined his friends. He did not do any work in the bank and pretended to do something sitting behind a bit of glass. Harris felt George was a very lazy person, who never wanted to work but would always boss around. Harris always got angry at George whenever he objected to his work. He always spoke ill about George in his absence. He said that whenever he didn’t get his way, he got upset. Harris felt even 24 hours of sleep be it summer or winter, was not enough for George because whenever he got a chance to sleep he would just snore off. George was very clever in taking advantage of others.

           Harris’ method of doing work reminds the author of Uncle Podger. There was a picture standing in the dining-room, waiting to be put up. He reassured everyone that he would do it. Then he sent the
           <br/>
           girl out for six pence worth of nails, and then one of the boys after her to tell her what size to get. He sends other members of the family to bring a hammer, ladder, chair, lamp, ruler, pencil, etc. He again sent the girl for a bit of picture-cord. He finally lifted the picture and dropped it. In an attempt to save the picture he cut himself. Then he sat on his coat and made the family members find the coat to get his handkerchief. When he was at work the others would stand round in a semi-circle, ready to help. While trying to hang it he lost the nail and the hammer also. Then he lost sight of the mark that he had made on the wall for the nail. Trying to put the nail he smashed his thumb, and dropped the hammer, with a yell, on somebody’s toes. Finally, he made a new hole and about midnight the picture was up but still a little crooked.
