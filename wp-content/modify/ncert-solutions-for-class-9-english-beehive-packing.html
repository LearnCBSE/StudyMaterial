           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Montmorency’s ambition in life is to interfere with others and be abused. He wants to be a perfect nuisance and make people mad. If things are thrown at his head, he feels his day has not been wasted. To get somebody to stumble over him, and curse him steadily for an hour is his highest aim and object. He came and sat on things, just when they were going to be packed. He put his leg into the jam and worried the teaspoons and pretended that lemons were rats and got into the hamper and killed three of them.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is the natural, original sin that is bom in him that makes him do things like that.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            III. Discuss in groups and answer the following questions in two or three paragraphs.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Of the three, Jerome, George and Harris, who do you think is the best or worst packer? Support your answer with details from the text.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Of the three, Harris is the worst packer in this world. But none of them is the perfect packer. All of them are confused and do not know what is to be placed and where. So far as Jerome is concerned he unpacked the bag to find his toothbrush in a boot. He also packs his spectacles in the bag. Harris and George start their work in a light hearted spirit. There are piles of plates, cups, kettles, bottles, jars, pies, stoves, cakes and tomatoes. They break a cup. Harris packs the strawberry jam on top of a tomato and squashes it. They have to pick out the tomato with a teaspoon. George treads on the butter. He gets it off from his slipper and puts it in the kettle. He puts it down on a chair and Harris sits on it. It sticks to him and then they look for it all over the room. In this way they created chaos in the room.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           How did Montmorency ‘contribute’ to the packing?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Montmorency’s contribution to the packing cannot be forgotten. His ambition in life was to disturb others and be abused by them. He came and sat on things, just when they were going to be packed and he put his leg into the jam. He disturbed everything. He pretended the lemons to be rats and got into the hamper and killed three of them.
          </p>
          <p>
           Montmorency wanted to be a perfect nuisance and make people mad. If things are thrown at his head, he feels his day has not been wasted. To get somebody to stumble over him, and curse him steadily for an hour was his highest aim and objective. When he got succeeded in accomplishing it, his conceit became quite unbearable.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Do you find this story funny? What are the humorous elements in it? (Pick out at least three, think about what happens, as well as how it is described.)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The story is really humorous and funny. Jerome’s episode of packing, Harris’s and George’s way of packing and Montmorency’s contribution have made the story funny and interesting. Jerome was confused about his toothbrush and found it in a boot. He also packed his spectacles in the bag. The incident of butter makes the reader laugh. George treads on the butter and it sticks to his slipper. Later he puts it on the chair. Harris sits on the chair and it sticks to his bottom. They squash the tomatoes by putting the strawberry jam on them.
          </p>
          <p>
           Montmorency’s pretention for the lemons to be rats is also fascinating and funny.
          </p>
          <p>
           These incidents are described in an orderly and perfect way.
