           <br/>
           Staffing function of management helps in obtaining right people and putting them on the right jobs.
           <br/>

           </strong>
           In all organisations, there is a need for people to perform work.
           <br/>
           Staffing function helps in discovering and obtaining competent personnel for various jobs.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (ii) Higher performance
           </strong>
           Staffing finds the right person for the right job. It ensures higher performance of the employees as work is assigned according to their capabilities and at the same time, organisational objectives are achieved in the most efficient and effective manner.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (iii) Survival and growth
           </strong>
           By appointing efficient staff, staffing ensures the continuous survival and growth of an enterprise. An organisation grows with the sincere efforts of its employees only.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (iv) Optimum utilisation of human resources
           </strong>
           Through manpower planning and job analysis, we can find out the number and types of employees required in the organisation. So, there are no chances of overmanning, shortage or under-utilisation of personnel.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (v) Motivation and morale
