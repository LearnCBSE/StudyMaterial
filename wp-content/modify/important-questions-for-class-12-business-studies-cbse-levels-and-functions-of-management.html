           <br/>
           <strong>
            pre-determined sequence’. Explain. (HOTS,-Delhi2008C)
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           Management is considered as a series of continuous, inter-related functions with no pre-determined sequence. The management process includes planning, organising, staffing, directing and controlling functions.
           <br/>
           These functions are inter-related. It is clear from the following facts:
           <br/>
           (i) Planning is the primary function and basis for all other functions.
           <br/>
           (ii) Organising is creation of the organisational structure to implement the plans.                .
           <br/>
           (ii) Staffing involves filling jobs with right persons in an organisation.
           <br/>
           (iv) Directing is concerned with instructing, guiding and inspiring people in the organisation for achieving its planned objectives through the employees.
           <br/>
           (v) The controlling function ensures that action leads to desired targets.
          </p>
          <p>
           <img alt="important-questions-for-class-12-business-studies-cbse-levels-and-functions-of-management-tp3-9jpg_Page1" class="aligncenter" height="298" loading="lazy" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5681/23179496631_cba8f1b913_o.jpg" width="255"/>
           <br/>
           Planning provides the basis (i.e. the standards of performance for management functions controlling and controlling helps in future planning). Similarly, directing initiates action and controlling ensures monitoring of performance.
           <br/>
           However, the various functions of a manager are discussed in order, i.e. planning, organising, staffing directing and controlling, but in reality the managers are rarely able to carry them in isolation. It is often difficult to pinpoint where one ended and the other began.
           <br/>
           Thus, these management functions are inter-related with no pre-determined sequence, while performing specific function.
