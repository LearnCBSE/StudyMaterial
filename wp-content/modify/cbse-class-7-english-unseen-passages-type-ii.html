           I had given those boots up when one evening they came. One by one I tried them on. In shape and fit, in finish and quality of leather they were the best he had ever made. I flew downstairs, wrote a cheque and posted it at once with my own hand.
          </p>
          <p>
           A week later, passing the little street, I thought I would go in and tell him how splendidly the new boots fitted. But when I came to where his shop had been, his name was gone.
           <br/>
           I went in very much disturbed. In the shop, there was a young man with an English face.
           <br/>
           “Mr. Gessler in ?” I said.
           <br/>
           “No, sir,” he said. “No, but we can attend to anything with pleasure. We’ve taken the shop over.”
           <br/>
           “Yes. yes,” I said, “but Mr. Gessler ?”
           <br/>
           “Oh !” he answered, “dead.”
           <br/>
           “Dead ! But I only received these boots from him last Wednesday week.”

           Long ago, there were no firemen. When fire broke out, everybody became a firefighter. People formed human chains (they still do if required) and passed buckets of water from a well or a pond to the blaze. Now there are laws about building construction which ensure that space is left between buildings to reduce the fire risk. Every new building, especially a public place, must ensure observance of fire prevention norms. Bands of firefighting workers with special equipment, known as fire brigades, are there to put out fires. Firefighters are highly trained people. They possess many skills. They cut off electricity supply, knock down dangerous walls, spray water and other materials to bring fire under control.
          </p>
          <p>
           They are also trained in first aid so that they can help people suffering from bums.

           Then they dragged him out of doors, taking a spade and hoe with them. No sooner had the dog got near a pine tree growing in the garden than he began to paw and scratch the ground, as if a mighty treasure lay beneath.
           <br/>
           “Quick, wife, hand me the spade and hoe !” cried the greedy old fool, as he danced with joy.

           Then the covetous old fellow, with a spade, and the old crone, with a hoe, began to dig; but there was nothing but a dead kitten, the smell ofwhich made them drop their tools and shut their noses. Furious at the dog, the old man kicked and beat him to death, and the old woman finished the work by nearly chopping off his head with the sharp hoe. They then flung him into the hole and heaped the earth over his carcass.
          </p>
          <p>
           The owner of the dog heard of the death of his pet and, mourning for him as if he had been his own child, went at night under the pine tree.

          </p>
          <p>
           For example, we can take away the fuel. If the fire has no fuel to feed on, no burning can take place. We often let a fire die out simply by not adding more fuel to it.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

           The second way of putting out a fire is to prevent oxygen from reaching it. No supply of oxygen means no fire. Small fires can be put out or ‘smothered with a damp blanket or a sack. This stops oxygen reaching the burning material. Sometimes, carbon dioxide is used to extinguish fire. It does not allow oxygen to reach the burning material.
          </p>
          <p>
           The third way of putting out a fire is to remove the heat. If the temperature can be brought down below the flash point, the fuel stops burning. You blow on a burning matchstick or a candle to put it out. In doing so, you remove the hot air around the flame bringing down its temperature below the flash point, and the candle goes out. Sometimes, water is sprayed on a fire. It absorbs heat from the burning fuel and lowers the temperature. The blanket of water also cuts off the supply of oxygen, and the fire is extinguished.

           1. People generally extinguish a fire by stopping to add more fuel to it.
           <br/>
           2. A damp blanket stops the flow of oxygen to the fire. The fire cannot bum without oxygen and so the damp blanket helps in putting it out.
           <br/>
           3. A flash point for an object is the temperature on which it bums.
           <br/>
           4. ‘Smothered’.

           The Hermit said, “If you had not pitied my weakness yesterday and had not dug these beds for me, you would have gone away. Then that man would have attacked you and you would have wished you had stayed with me. So the most important time was when you were digging the beds. And I was the most important man, and to do me good was your most important business. After¬wards, when the man ran to us, the most important time was when you were caring for him, because if you had not dressed his wounds he would have died without having made peace with you. So he was the most important man, and what you did for him was your most important business.”

            Passage 6
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           1 “A scrubbing pail,’’ She said vexed. “A Mother’s Day gift of a scrubbing pail.” Her voice almost broke.
           <br/>
           2 Tears sprang to Nick’s eyes. Without a word he picked up the scrubbing pail and mop and blindly trudged down the stairs. I put the comb in my pocket and ran after him. He was crying and I felt so bad I began to cry, too. On the way down we met Father. Nick could not talk, so I explained.
           <br/>
           3 “I will take it back,” sobbed Nick.
           <br/>
           4 “No,” said Father firmly, taking the pail. “It is a fine gift. A wonderful gift. I should have thought of it myself. Women sometimes don’t see how to escape their burdens. They escape in pretty baubles rather than lighter work.”
           <br/>
           5 We all went upstairs again, Nick climbing very reluctantly. Inside the kitchen, Mother was still scrubbing, but not vigorously. Slowly, sadly.
           <br/>
           6 Without a word Father soaked the puddle of dirty water up with the mop and using the foot wringer on the bucket, neatly squeezed it dry.
           <br/>
           7 “You did not let Nick finish,” he said sternly.
           <br/>
           8 “Part of his gift was that he was going to wash the floor from now on.” He looked at Nick. “Isn’t that so, Nick ?”
           <br/>
           9 With a flush of shame Nick understood the lesson. “Yes, oh, yes,” he said in a low, eager tone.
           <br/>
           10 Quickly, repentantly, Mother said, “It is too heavy work for a fourteen-year- old boy.”
           <br/>
           11 It was then I realised how smart Father was. “Ah,” he said cunningly. “Not with this wonderful wringer and scrub pail. It’s much easier. Your hands stay clean, and your knees don’t hurt.” Again Father demonstrated quickly.
           <br/>
           12 Mother said, looking sadly at Nick, “Ah, a woman can become so stupid.” She kissed Nick and he felt better. Then they turned to me.
           <br/>
           13 “Where is your gift?” asked Father. Nick looked at me and paled. I felt the comb in my pocket. It would make the scrubbing pail again a scrubbing pail compared with a comb with shining stones just like diamonds.
           <br/>
           14 “Half the scrubbing pail,” I said mournfully, and Nick looked at me with love
           <br/>
           in his eyes.

            Passage 7
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           1 The grand fare was set before the friend and Moti Lai waited in agonising silence. Today surely, his friend would not say that it did not compare with the feasts of his village. With the great variety of food served, dinner took a long time.
          </p>
          <p>
           2 At last the friend spoke, ‘Today, your food, dear Moti, was fit for the table of a king. But still, it cannot compare with the feasts I have at home.”
          </p>
          <p>
           3 Moti Lai nearly dropped down in disappointment. What were the feasts of his friend’s village like? How lavish were they that the rich fare of his valley could not even compare with them ?
          </p>
          <p>
           4 At lunch the next day, the food was so delicious that passers-by stopped and licked their lips at just the smell of it. Moti Lai bit his lips nervously. Yet once again Kisan Lai’s response was, “I would really have said that the food today was incomparable had I not tasted the feasts at home.”
          </p>
          <p>
           5 Moti Lai silently acknowledged defeat and for the rest of Kisan Lai’s Stay, though he always had the best of food served, he no longer tried to compete with the food Kisan ate in his village. Eventually, Kisan Lai went away.
          </p>
          <p>
           6 The years rolled by. One winter, Moti Lai decided to leave his snow-bound land for a while to enjoy the warmer climate of the plains. He decided to visit his friend. It would be a good opportunity, he felt, to taste the famous feasts of Kisan’s village and their feasts had never really left Moti Lai’s thoughts.
          </p>
          <p>
           7 Kisan Lai was delighted to see his friend after so many years. “Do stay and rest here awhile”, he said and Moti Lai willingly accepted.
          </p>
          <p>
           8 That evening Moti Lai spent the hours in great expectation. Dinner was served. A servant brought in two plates. Rotis, a bowl of curd, salad, dal and a plate of vegetables was all that had been served. Then the servant departed. Moti Lai waited expectantly. The servant did not reappear. His friend turned to him and said, “Please start your meal.” Moti Lai gulped down the food without a word. He told himself to be patient. Surely, tomorrow the delicacies of the village would be served to him, he thought.
