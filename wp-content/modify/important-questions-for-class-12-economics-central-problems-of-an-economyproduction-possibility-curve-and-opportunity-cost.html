           <strong>
            1.Economic Problem
           </strong>
           Problem of choice or a problem of allocation of resources is the major economic problem which arises due to scarce resources and alternative uses of resources. With this meaning we have several other aspects also to study which are:
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            (i) Scarcity
           </strong>
           It refers to the situation where demand for a good exceed its supply.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            (ii) Choice
           </strong>
           It refers to the process of selection from available limited resources .
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           Or in more simple way
          </p>
          <p>
           ‘Scarcity causes choice’
          </p>
          <p>
           ‘Choice implies decision-making’
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           ‘Decision-making’ relates to usage of limited resources in a manner that consumer maximises his satisfaction, producer maximises his profits and a nation maximises its social welfare.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            2.Central Problems of An Economy
           </strong>
           At the micro level, every economy has to face three central problems, i.e. what to produce, how to produce and for whom to produce.
          </p>
          <p>
           (i)What to produce Problem of ‘what to produce’ arises as the economy has limitedresources. In an economy because of scarcity of resources, producers are unable to produce everything in desired quantity, a but they will have to make a choice as to which one is important as a whole, so that limited resources can be rationally managed. Problem of ‘what to produce’ involves two fold decisions; kinds of goods to be produced and quantity of goods to be produced.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           <strong>
            (ii)How to produce
           </strong>
           It is concerning with, how to organise production. This problem is related to the choice of technique of production. It arises due to the availability of various techniques for the production of a commodity such as labour intensive technique and capital intensive technique. Depending upon the availability of resources, either technique is used.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            (iii) For whom to produce
           </strong>
           This is essentially the problem of distribution of income between (a) the different groups of the society and (b) now and in the future. As to income distribution between the different groups with in a society an economy has to find ways and means to get a distribution that promotes social welfare at present and on the other hand do not compromise the need of the future generation. Distribution of income could be of two types:
          </p>
          <p>
           (a)Factoral distribution
          </p>
          <p>
           (b)Interpersonal distribution
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            3.Production Possibility Curve (PPC)
           </strong>
           It is a curve which shows various production possibilities with the help of given limited resources and technology. It is also known as production possibility frontier and transformation curve. it is a tool which can help to solve the central economic problems.
           <br/>
           <img alt="important-questions-for-class-12-economics-central-problems-of-an-economyproduction-possibility-curve-and-opportunity-cost-t-2-1" class="aligncenter" height="222" loading="lazy" src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/757/22497707669_0bbe6554a2_o.png" width="245"/>
           From the given curve following conclusions are drawn

          <div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           (i) PPC is always concavg to the origin because of rising MRT (Marginal Rate of Transformation)
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) PPC slopes downward because of inverse relationship, between the production of the
           <br/>
           two goods, i.e. production of both the goods cannot be increased simultaneously
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            4.Shift in the Production Possibility Curve
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           The rightward shift of Production Possibility Curve indicates the increase in the resources or productive capacity of the economy, which expands production of both the goods. On the other hand, the leftward shift of Production Possibility Curve indicates the decrease in the resources or productive capacity of the economy, which contracts production of both the goods
          </p>

           <br/>
           <strong>
            5.Rotation in Production Possibility Curve
           </strong>
           The Production Possibility Curve will rotate, whenever, there will be change in technology i.e. either improvement or deprivation, related to the production of one good only.

            6.Opportunity Cost
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Opportunity cost for a commodity is the amount of other commodity that has been foregone in order to produce the first or in otherwords, it is the cost of the next best (second best) opportunity foregone.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            7.Marginal Opportunity Cost (MOC) or Marginal Rate of Transformation (MRT)
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           It is the ratio of number of units of a good ‘Y sacrificed to produce an additional unit of good‘X.

           . Under this problem, the decision is to be taken for whom we should produce commodities for the rich or for the poor. All goods and services cannot be produced for everyone. If we produce for the rich, who have capacity to buy, then poor people will suffer from starvation.

          <p>
           On the other hand, if we produce for the poor for the sake of social justice, then we will have to consider, do they have resources to buy?

           <strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           Problem of ‘what to produce’ arises as the economy has limited resources.. Because of scarcity city of resources, producers are unable to produce everything in desired quantity, but they will have to make a choice as to which one is important as a whole, so that limited resources can be rationally managed.
          </p>
          <p>
           Problem of ‘what to produce’ involved two fold decisions; kinds of goods to be produced and quantity of goods to be produced.

           <strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           It is a curve which shows various production possibilities with the help of given limited resources and technology. It is also known as Production Possibility Frontier and transformation curve.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is downward sloping from left to right because in a situation of fuller utilisation of the given resources, production of both the goods cannot be increased together. More of good X can be produced only with less of good Y as resources are scarce.
          </p>
          <p>
           Because of this inverse relationship between production of both the goods, PPC is downward sloping.

           <strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           Opportunity cost for a commodity is the amount of other commodity that has been foregone in order to produce the first or in otherwords, it is the cost of the next best (second best) opportunity foregone.

          <p>
           <strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           Production Possibility Curve (PPC) is concave to the origin because marginal opportunity cost of shifting resources from commodity Y to commodity X tends to rise. Marginal opportunity cost tends to rise because the factors of production are not perfect substitute of each other. So when one factor is shifted from the production of one good to another, then its productivity falls, causing marginal opportunity cost to rise.

            Ans.
           </strong>
           Production Possibility Curve (PPC) will not shift due to unemployment in an economy. Due to unemployment in the economy, labour is under utilised (or less than fully employed). As a result, actual ouput is less than the potential output. Economy operates from a point below PPC.

          </p>
          <p>
           (i) PPC is downward sloping Downward slope of PPC indicates that if the country wants to produce more of one good, it has to reduce the production of other good.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) PPC is concave to origin Concave shape of PPC means that slope of PPC increases as in this concept production will obey the law of increasing opportunity costs or increasing Marginal Rate of Substitution.
