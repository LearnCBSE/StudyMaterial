           We find the following changes in the army at this time:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            A permanent army was kept by the king or the ruler. This was well organized.
           </li>
           <li>
            Soldiers used different kinds of weapons such as battle-axes, arrows, spikes, spears, barbed dats, swords, iron clubs, javelins, barbed arrows, long arrows, etc.
           </li>
           <li>
            Elephants, Chariots, Cavalry were used along with foot soldiers in the royal ground.
           </li>
           <li>
            Besides, there were military leaders who provided the king with troops whenever he (the king) needed them. They were not paid regular salaries. Instead, some of them received grants of land. They collected revenue from the land and used this to maintain soldiers and horses, and provide equipment for warfare. These men were known as Samantas. Whenever the ruler was weak Samantas tried to become independent.
           </li>
          </ol>

           </span>
           <br/>
           What were the new7 administrative arrangements during this period?

           <span style="color: #008000;">

             Answer:
            </strong>
           </span>
           <br/>
           The following new administrative arrangements were noticed during this period:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Kings adopted a number of steps to win the support of men who were powerful, either economically, or socially, or because of political and military strength.
           </li>
           <li>
            Some important administrative posts were now hereditary. This means that sons succeeded fathers to these posts. For example, the poet Harishena was a maha- danda-nayaka, or chief judicial officer, like his father.
           </li>
           <li>
            Sometimes, one person held many offices. For example, besides being a Maha- danda-nayak Harishena was a Kumar-amatya, meaning an important minister, and a Sandhi-Vigrahika meaning a minister of war and peace.
           </li>
           <li>
            Besides, important men probably had a say in local administration. These included the nagara-shreshthi or chief banker or merchant of the city, the Sarthavaha or leader of the merchant caravans, the Prathama-Kulika or the chief craftsman, and the head of the Kayasthas or scribes.
           </li>
          </ol>

            He had to sit on the throne and play the veena and recite poetry.

           <li>
            He had to fight several battles.

           In Samudraguptaâ€™s prashasti the poet-praised him in glowing terms. According to this prashasti, Samudragupta was a great warrior who won victories in battles. He was a learned king and the best of poets. He was equal to the gods. He was a brave ruler of the Gupta dynasty whose area of influence spread far and wide.

            Ans:
           </strong>
           Samudragupta was a great ruler of the Gupta dynasty. He was a brave warrior too who won victories in battles. His body was most charming and covered with the plenteous beauty of the marks of hundreds of scars caused by battle-axes, arrows, spikes, spears, barbed darts, swords, iron clubs, javelins, barbed arrows, long arrows and many other weapons.

          <p>
           <strong>

           Samudraguptaâ€™s policies towards the rulers of Aryavarta were very strict. All the nine rulers were brutally defeated and their kingdoms were made a part of Samudraguptaâ€™s empire. But so far the rulers of Dakshinapatha were concerned, Samudragupta maintained a submissive altitude towards them. There were twelve rulers who surrendered to Samudragupta after being defeated and he then allowed all of them to rule again.

           <strong>
            Ans:
           </strong>
           In South India, during this period there were two famous ruling dynasties knows as the Pallavas and Chalukyas.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The Pallavas. The kingdom of the Pallavas spread from the region around their capital, Kanchipuram to the Kaveri delta.
           </li>
           <li>
            The Chalukyas. The kingdom of the Chalukyas was centred around the Raichur Doab, between the rivers. Krishna and Tungabhadra. Their capital was at Aihole. It was an important trading centre. Besides, it was a religiousÂ centre too. There were a number of temples there.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           The Chalukyas and Pallavas were very much competitive. They were great rivals. They frequently said one another lands. Their main target was the capital cities because they were rich towns.
          </p>
          <p>
           The name and fame of the Chalukyas and Pallavas did not last long. They lost their influence and finally, they were replaced by the Rashtrakuta and Chola dynasties.
