          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           In a family of 3 children calculate the probability of having at least one boy. (2014OD)
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           S = {bbb, bbg, ggb, ggg}
           <br/>
           Atleast 1 boy = {bbb, bbg, ggb}
           <br/>
           ∴ P(atleast 1 boy) = \(\frac{3}{4}\)
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           A letter of English alphabet is chosen at random. Determine the probability that the chosen letter is a consonant. (2015D)
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Total English alphabets = 26
           <br/>
           Number of consonants = 21
           <br/>
           ∴ P (letter is a consonant) = \(\frac{21}{26}\)
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           A card is drawn at random from a well shuffled pack of 52 playing cards. Find the probability of getting neither a red card nor a queen. (2016OD)
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           S = 52
           <br/>
           P(neither a red card nor a queen)
           <br/>
           = 1 – P(red card or a queen)

           Question 4.
           <br/>
           A box contains cards numbered 6 to 50. A card is drawn at random from the box. Calculate the probability that the drawn card has a number which is a perfect square. (2013OD)
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Total number of cards = 50 – 6 + 1 = 45
           <br/>
           Perfect square numbers are 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, i.e.,
           <br/>
           5 numbers
           <br/>
           ∴ P(a prefect square) = \(\frac{5}{45}=\frac{1}{9}\)

           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Cards marked with number 3, 4, 5, …, 50 are placed in a box and mixed thoroughly. A card is drawn at random from the box. Find the probability that the selected card bears a perfect square number. (2016D)
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Total no. of cards = 50 – 3 + 1 = 48
           <br/>
           Perfect square number cards are 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49 i.e., 6 cards
           <br/>
           ∴ P(perfect square number) = \(\frac{6}{48}=\frac{1}{8}\)
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 6.
           <br/>
           A number is chosen at random from the numbers -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. What will be the probability that square of this number is less than or equal to 1? (2017D)
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           (-3)
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
           = 9; (-2)

            2
           </sup>
           = 1; (0)
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
           = 0
           <br/>
           (1)
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
           = 1; (2)
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
           = 4; (3)
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
           2 = 9
           <br/>
           ∴ P(Sq. of nos. of ≤ 1) = \(\frac{3}{7}\)

           Question 7.
           <br/>
           If two different dice are rolled together, calculate the probability of getting an even number on both dice. (2014D)
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Two dice can be thrown as 6 × 6 = 36 ways
           <br/>
           Even numbers on both the dice can be obtained as
           <br/>
           <img alt="Important Questions for Class 10 Maths Chapter 15 Probability 2" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-130139" height="71" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Important-Questions-for-Class-10-Maths-Chapter-15-Probability-2.png" width="273"/>
           <br/>
           ∴ P(even numbers) = \(\frac{9}{36}=\frac{1}{4}\)
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 8.
           <br/>
           Two different dices are tossed together. Find the probability that the product of the two numbers on the top of the dice is 6. (2015OD)
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Total outcomes = 6= 62 = 36
           <br/>
           Possible outcomes having the product of the two numbers on the top of the dice as 6 are
           <br/>
           (3 × 2, 2 × 3, 6 × 1, 1 × 6), i.e, 4
           <br/>
           P(Product of two nos. is 6) = \(\frac{4}{36}=\frac{1}{9}\)
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 9.
           <br/>
           The probability of selecting a rotten apple ran domly from a heap of 900 apples is 0.18. What is the number of rotten apples in the heap? (2017OD)
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           <img alt="Important Questions for Class 10 Maths Chapter 15 Probability 3" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-130140" height="85" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Important-Questions-for-Class-10-Maths-Chapter-15-Probability-3.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Important-Questions-for-Class-10-Maths-Chapter-15-Probability-3.png 323w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Important-Questions-for-Class-10-Maths-Chapter-15-Probability-3-300x79.png 300w" width="323"/>
           <br/>

           Question 17.
           <br/>
           A card is drawn at random from a well shuffled pack of 52 playing cards. Find the probability that the drawn card is neither a jack nor an ace. (2013D)
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Total number of cards = 52
           <br/>
           Numbers of jacks = 4
           <br/>
           Numbers of aces = 4
           <br/>
           Card is neither a jack nor an ace
           <br/>
           = 52 – 4 – 4 = 44

           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} = 6
           <br/>
           ‘an even number or multiple of 3’ are 2, 3, 4, 6, i.e., 4 numbers
           <br/>
           ∴ Required probability = \(\frac{4}{6}=\frac{2}{3}\)

           (iii) a card of clubs.
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Number of red face cards removed = 6
           <br/>
           ∴ Remaining cards = 52 – 6 = 46
           <br/>
           Hence, Total no. of outcomes = 46
           <br/>
           (i) Possible outcomes of red cards = 26 – 6 = 20
           <br/>

           Question 34.
           <br/>
           From a pack of 52 playing cards, Jacks, Queens and Kings of red colour are removed. From the remaining, a card is drawn at random. Find the probability that drawn card is:
           <br/>
           (i) a black King
           <br/>
           (ii) a card of red colour
           <br/>
           (iii) a card of black colour (2016OD)
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Total cards in the pack = 52
           <br/>
           Cards removed
           <br/>
           = 2(Jacks) + 2(Queens) + 2(Kings) = 6
           <br/>
           ∴ Remaining cards = 52 – 6 = 46
           <br/>
           (i) Number of black Kings = 2
           <br/>
           ∴ P(a black King) = \(\frac{2}{46}=\frac{1}{23}\)
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Total red cards in the pack = 26
           <br/>
           Red cards removed = 6
           <br/>
           Remaining red cards = 26 – 6 = 20
           <br/>
           ∴ P(a card of red colour) = \(\frac{20}{46}=\frac{10}{23}\)
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Total black cards in the pack = 26

           Find the probability that a leap year selected at random, will contain 53 Mondays. (2013OD)
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           In a leap year, total number of days = 366
           <br/>
           ∴ 366 days
           <br/>
           = 52 complete weeks + 2 extra days
           <br/>
           Thus, a leap year always has 52 Mondays and extra 2 days.
           <br/>
           Extra 2 days can be,
           <br/>
           (i) Sunday and Monday

           (vi) Friday and Saturday
           <br/>
           (vii) Saturday and Sunday
           <br/>
           Let E be the event that a leap year has 53 Mondays.
           <br/>
           ∴ E = {Sun and Mon, Mon and Tues}

           (ii) ‘A multiple of 5’ numbers are 5, 10, 15, ……., 45, i.e., 9
           <br/>
           ∴ P(a multiple of 5) = \(\frac{9}{49}\)
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) “A perfect square” numbers are 1, 4, 9, …….., 49, i.e., 7

           (iii) divisible by 5
           <br/>
           (iv) a prime number less than 20
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Total number of cards = 60 – 11 + 1 = 50
           <br/>
           (i) Odd nos, are 11, 13, 15, 17, …. 59 = 25 no.

           Question 61.
           <br/>
           Red queens and black jacks are removed from a pack of 52 playing cards. A card is drawn at random from the remaining cards, after reshuffling them. Find the probability that the drawn card is (2014OD)
           <br/>
           (i) a king
           <br/>
           (ii) of red colour
           <br/>
           (iii) a face card
           <br/>
           (iv) a queen
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Number of red queens = 2
           <br/>
           Number of black jacks = 2
           <br/>
           Remaining cards = 52 – 2 – 2 = 48

           Question 62.
           <br/>
           All the red face cards are removed from a pack of 52 playing cards. A card is drawn at random from the remaining cards, after reshuffling them. Find the probability that the drawn card is (2014OD)
           <br/>
           (i) of red colour
           <br/>
           (ii) a queen
           <br/>
           (iii) an ace
           <br/>
           (iv) a face card
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Total number of cards = 52
           <br/>
           Red face cards = 6

           Question 63.
           <br/>
           Five cards, the ten, jack, queen, king and ace of diamonds, are well shuffled with their faces downwards. One card is then picked up at random. (2014OD)
           <br/>
           (a) What is the probability that the drawn card is the queen?
           <br/>
           (b) If the queen is drawn and put aside, and a second card is drawn, find the probability that the second card is (i) an ace (ii) a queen.
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           (a) Total events = 5; P(queen) = \(\frac{1y}{5}\)
           <br/>
           (b) Now total events = 4
           <br/>
           (i) P (an ace) = \(\frac{1}{4}\)
           <br/>
           (ii) P (a queen) = \(\frac{0}{4}\) = 0 …[As there is no queen left

           Question 64.
           <br/>
           A card is drawn at random from a well shuffled deck of playing cards. Find the probability that the card drawn is (2015OD)
           <br/>
           (i) a card of spade or an ace.
           <br/>
           (ii) a black king.
           <br/>
           (iii) neither a jack nor a king.
           <br/>
           (iv) either a king or a queen.
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Total no. of outcomes = 52
