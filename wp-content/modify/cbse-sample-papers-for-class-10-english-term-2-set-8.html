           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below.
           <br/>
           “Women need more sleep than men, if not the same. The consequences of a bad sleep cycle also tend to be graver in women compared to men,” said an expert. Sleep plays a vital role in maintaining mental, physical, and emotional health. But with lockdowns imposed and offices shut yet again, people continue to work from home, a model that not only blurs the lines between office and home,
          </p>
          <p>
           5.but also leads to increased exposure to screens. This, coupled with pandemic-induced anxiety, and lack of physical activity, not only takes a toll on one’s health, but also contributes to poor sleep quality. But it is women, especially working mothers, who are worst affected – as women need more sleep than men, say experts. “Several studies have proven that the sleep requirement may slightly vary between men and women, given their biological structure.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           10. A significant factor for this is how both women and men spend their day. Research has documented the differences in the time women and men have dedicated to paid and unpaid labour, work and social responsibilities, and family caregiving,” they say. They added that women get slightly more sleep than men, approximately 11-13 minutes more, but men tend to have a much deeper sleep. Women are more likely to get up in the middle of the night to take care of
          </p>
          <p>
           15. others in the family. Sleep works best when it is uninterrupted.
           <br/>
           “Additionally, women are more likely to take a nap during the day, suggesting that their total sleep time may be misleading. Napping during the day adds to the sleep time (number of hours spent sleeping) and makes night-time sleep less restful,” he continued.
          </p>
          <p>
           20. Reasons women need more (and better quality) sleep than men: Increased risk of sleep disorders: Women are 40 per cent more prone to insomnia and restless leg syndrome (RLS) which causes an uncontrollable urge to move your legs, usually because of an uncomfortable sensation disrupting sleep, requiring women to sleep a little extra to make up for the lost sleep.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           25. Hormonal imbalances: Women undergo multiple hormonal changes throughout their lives. The changes create disturbances in their circadian rhythm, requiring extra sleep.
           <br/>
           Mental health: “Women are twice more likely to suffer from depression than men. In India, women tend to face adverse mental health issues due to their professional commitments and added responsibilities of household chores. A good sleep cycle is needed for them to
          </p>
          <p>
           30. keep their mental health in check,” said an expert.
           <br/>
           Personal lifestyle and fitness: A good night’s sleep aids a women’s metabolism. It gives more energy to exercise, concentrate, and perform other critical daily tasks. According to researchers at the Loughborough University, UK, women need more sleep than men due to multitasking. Women need more sleep than men, if not the same. The consequences of a bad sleep cycle also tend to be much graver in women compared to men. Several studies have extensively shown that sleep-deprived women are at an increased risk of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, heart strokes, stress, and mental health issues than sleep-deprived men. Not only that, sleep deprivation can also aggravate pre-existing mood disturbances, such as anger, depression, and anxiety. It can lead to confusion, fatigue, and lack of vigour, ultimately impacting productivity. Women may also face more challenges in concentration than men.
