           By Piyush/Priya, Coordinator A seminar for class XII students of the schools of our zone was organized to discuss on the topic, ‘Rising prices create a crisis’. It was attended by some very eminent economists and politicians. All the speakers expressed their views on the consequences of rising prices. They pointed out that India is a poor country having numerous villages. Majority of the population lives below the poverty line and they are even unable to fulfill their basic requirements. The prices of the essential commodities have increased at an alarming rate. The poor people are unable to afford even a single meal. The purchase of vegetables, fruits, rice, etc. have gone beyond the reach of the common man. The necessities have taken the form of luxuries and rupee has lost its value. Now it becomes the duty of the government to take action against undue price hike and stop black marketing to control the rising prices.

           Subject: Cruetly to Stray Dogs.
           <br/>
           Dear Sir,
           <br/>
           I would like to share my views through the columns of your esteemed newspaper regarding the ill-treatment and neglect to the animals and in general, stray dogs around us. The sight is heart-rending and shocking.
          </p>
          <p>
           Being a human, it is our moral duty to look around us and stop such cruel activities. Every individual must be sensible enough to realize that these animals also form the integral part of our eco-system. If one cannot take care of animals then he should not at least tease them. They can inform any of the organisations which can be contacted.
          </p>
          <p>
           The animals cannot express their sufferings or pains but they do feel it. They need our attention, care and love. We should spread awareness through campaigns, posters, plays, etc.
           <br/>
           Yours truly,

           VALUE EDUCATION-TODAY’S NEED
           <br/>
           By Anu/Arun
           <br/>
           Education makes a man perfect. The overall development of personality whether it’s spiritual, physical, social, mental etc., all depends on education. It inculcates ethics and moral values where there is no place for violence. But in the modem world of competitions, children are deprived of these values. Conflicting values and moral dilemmas have become common in our daily lives. It has confused a child a lot and there is a sense of inadequacy to face the life situations. Media has negative influence on their personalities and to uplift the students morally and spiritually has become the topmost priority of the educational institutions. Till now, the institutions were concerned with the academic progress of the child, there was no place for value education in the curriculum, but the decreasing level of morality has shocked everybody. Illegal means of getting the things done have become very common and are in fashion. So, there is a need of acute awareness and bringing forth the generation which is fruitful in the building of the nation. This could be possible only when there is an introduction of value education in schools. Although many schools have already introduced this in the curriculum but there is widespread need of taking it seriously. Only then the children can be developed into a stable, well rounded and morally integrated personalities.

           Dear Friends,
           <br/>
           Today, I feel privileged to get an opportunity to speak on the benefits of yoga. Today’s sedentary lifestyle has given invitation to many diseases where man has limited time to spare for his health. But practising yoga helps to not get stuck in mental noise. It helps in maintaining balance between the mental and the social status of a human being. With regular practice of yoga, we tend to become more sensitive to the kind of food our body asks. A few minutes of yoga helps in getting relief from stress. It helps detox the body and de-stress the mind. We all want to live in a peaceful atmosphere and among nature. But we hardly realize that peace can be found within us. Yoga is the best way to calm a disturbed mind. On the other hand, yoga postures massage organs and strengthen the muscles. Breathing techniques and meditation help in releasing stress and improving the immune system. Yoga and meditation work on keeping the mind happy and peaceful. When we feel drained out of energy, a few minutes spent on yoga provides freshness and energy. It also helps in improving our body posture.
           <br/>
           In the end, I would like to tell that yoga is a continuous process, so keep practicing!

           <br/>
           (a) How are the attitude of the ironmaster and his daughter different? Support your answer from the text.

           <br/>
           (b) Compare Sophie and Jansie highlighting their temperaments and aspirations.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The attitude of the ironmaster was totally different from his daughter, Edla. It can be proved by several instances from the story. According to the ironmaster, the peddler was an old acquaintance. He mistook him to be his old friend so he invited him to his house to spend Christmas. But when the peddler refused, he sent his daughter to persuade the peddler to come to his house as she had the quality of convincing people. She was able to win the confidence of the peddler who ultimately agreed to come to her home.
          </p>
          <p>
           When the ironmaster realized that the peddler was not the one who was thinking after he got his hair cut and shaving done, he immediately asked him to get out of his house. However, his daughter asked the peddler to stay with them that day for Christmas. She had a feeling of sympathy for the ‘poor and hungry’ man. She offered him her father’s suit as a Christmas gift. It was her attitude that changed the peddler’s mind and he returned the money he had stolen.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Sophie and Jansie were classmates. They belonged to lower-middle class families. Jansie was practical, whereas Sophie was a dreamer. Jansie knew the harsh realities of life and she advised Sophie to not to indulge in fantasies. Sophie was totally unaware of the realities of life and dreamt of big things. She wanted to have a boutique of her own. She also wanted to become an actress as there was a lot of money in that profession and she wanted to be a fashion designer too. Overall, it can be said that she wanted to live a grand and luxurious life. But there was least possibility of fulfilling her dreams. Jansie warned her to remain grounded but she was busy in dreaming wild.
          </p>
          <p>
           On the other side, Jansie knew her limitations. She was not a daydreamer like Sophie. She also knew that both of them were likely to work in a biscuit factory in future and she tried to explain it to Sophie who was over-ambitious and a daydreamer.

           (a) How did the Tiger king stand in danger losing his kingdom? How was he able to avert the danger?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Tiger king was told by the astrologer that he would be killed by a tiger, so he started hunting and killing tigers and prohibited all the people of the kingdom from hunting them. If anybody disobeyed him, he would be punished severely. A high ranking British official wanted to kill the tigers. Maharaja did not give him permission and told him that he could kill any animal except tigers. The officer wished to get a photograph of himself holding a gun beside the tiger’s body. But Maharaja even refused that. As he had not allowed the officer to fulfil his desire, he was in a danger of losing his kingdom.
          </p>
          <p>
           He then discussed the issue with his Deewan and offered a bribe of 50 diamond rings of the value of three lakh rupees to the wife of the British officer. She became happy and kept all of them. This way, he was able to retain his kingdom.

           Sophie is a young girl who always lives in a world of fantasy. She belongs to a lower middle class family. Like other adolescents, she too had dreams. She wants to own a boutique, become an actress, a fashion designer or a manager. She does not know where the money will come from for all her dreams, she lives far from reality. Even her friend Jansie warns her but she is given to her wild thoughts. She ignores them all. No one shows interest in what she thinks, so she confides in her brother Geoff who is an introvert. She also likes Danny Casey, a young football player from Ireland. She always thinks of him. She even thinks that she has met him and he has promised to meet her again. She goes to the place where she expects to meet him but finding him nowhere, she feels disappointed. This way, thousand of thoughts keep hovering in her mind.

           Again at the YMCA pool, a misadventure took place. He was learning swimming there. Once day, a strong boy threw him in the deep water when he was sitting at the edge of the pool. Douglas slowly went to the bottom of the pool in the same sitting position. He tried three times to come out of the water but failed. He was now in great panic. He was completely exhausted and his lungs were aching. Ultimately, he fainted but was saved. This incident had a negative impact on him and fear of water stayed with him. He could not sleep or eat for many days and remained away from water.

           BOMB BLAST IN THE MARKET by XYZ
           <br/>
           Day-by-day, the incidents of bomb blasts are increasing. It seems as if they are a part of daily news. Two days ago, I went to the market with my parents for Diwali shopping. The market was beautifully decorated and a huge crowd of people was busy in shopping. Everything appeared to be normal when suddenly we heard a blast from the nearby area. Within fraction of minutes, everything went haphazard. Before we could understand anything, the shrieking sounds started coming from all the sides. The whole atmosphere changed completely. Nearly four shops were hit badly and fire broke out in a restaurant gulping the other shops in flames. Women and children were lying on the floor, seriously hurt. Overall, I can say that the whole situation was appalling and pathetic.

           (a) Douglas was terribly afraid of water due to an incident in which he had nearly died in the swimming pool. He was so afraid that he avoided going near water for many days. But he liked the water activities like canoeing, wade in the waters of cascade, fishing, etc. The fear of water seized him to do any activity. It destroyed his joy of all activities. So, he thought to overcome his fear and engaged an instructor to learn swimming. The instructor taught him all the tricks of becoming a good swimmer. Once the instructor left him alone in the pool when he was sure that Douglas would be able to swim on his own, Douglas swam the length of the pool up and down but he was not satisfied so he went to Lake Wentworth. The old fear returned when he had put his face under water and could see nothing except bottomless water. To overcome his fear, he dived into the lake and swam to the other shore. He shouted with joy as he had triumphed.

           (b) Sophie’s father was a hard-working man who did not believe in what Sophie tells him. He knew that she had a habit of indulging in wild fantasies. He was an aggressive person and had authoritative kind of a personality. He was a sports lover and took his children to watch football matches. His face reflected his whole day’s labour and it seemed grimy and sweated. He was fun loving too and it was obvious when he went to pub to celebrate United Team’s victory. He had a plump face and a thick neck. His face and arms were shiny and pink. He showed contempt when Geoff told him that Sophie met Danny Casey and started talking about him and his talent. But when he got to know from Sophie that Danny was going to buy a shop, he showed signs of disgust which scared Sophie.
