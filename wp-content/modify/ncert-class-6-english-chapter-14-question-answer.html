          </p>
          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Answer the following questions and share them with your teacher and classmates.
           <br/>
           (a) Have you ever flown a kite or seen someone fly it? Where? When?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Students will perform the activities and will share their experiences in class.
           <br/>
           On the occasion of Republic Day, our society organizes the Kite Festival in our community park. Last year, it was memorable for me as I also participated in it. The sky was filled with colorful kites, and people were enjoying the activity with their families and friends. The festival usually takes place in January, and it was a bright, sunny day perfect for kite flying.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           (b) Describe the kite – colour (s), shape, design of tail, and any other detail.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Keeping the patriotic spirit in our mind and soul, the kite I remember from that festival was quite vibrant. It was a classic diamond shape, with tricolour and blue. The design featured intricate patterns, with swirling lines and geometric shapes that made it stand out against the clear sky. The tail of the kite was long and made up of several strips of colorful fabric tied together, creating a rainbow effect.
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) What did you think when you saw the kite up in the sky?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           I felt very excited to see my kite flying up in the sky.

          </div>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Search the internet for videos on Kite Festivals and watch them with your teacher and classmates.
           <br/>
           (a) Share the things with your teacher that you saw and what the people were doing.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Students will surf the internet and will explore the Kite festivals. They will share their experience in class.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Would you like to participate in this kind of festival? Why?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Yes, I would love to participate in this kind of festival. Kite flying is not only a fun activity but also a way to connect with friends, family, and the community. The excitement of seeing kites of different shapes and colors fill the sky is exhilarating. Additionally, participating in such a festival allows me to experience cultural traditions, enjoy the outdoors, and create wonderful memories.
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) What kind of kite would you like to fly?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           I would like to fly a dragon-shaped kite. It would be large, with vibrant green and gold colors, and designed to look like a mythical dragon. The tail would be long and adorned with intricate patterns and streamers to mimic the dragon’s body. This kite would be eye-catching and unique, making it stand out among the others in the sky.

            Thoughts on the Use of Simile in the Poem
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The use of simile in this poem indeed helps us imagine better when we read it. By comparing the kites to “coloured birds,” the poet paints a vivid picture of the kites’ movement and beauty, making it easier for readers to visualize them soaring in the sky. Similarly, the comparison of the child’s desired lightness to that of air helps convey the sense of freedom and weightlessness the child yearns for. These similes enhance the imagery and emotional connection, allowing readers to feel the child’s longing and the beauty of the scene more deeply.

           This is called alliteration. For example, a big bright blue bag, a funny fan, etc.
           <br/>
           Create 4 other sets of words using alliteration.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Stanza 1: wild – wind
           <br/>
           Stanza 3: stand – stare
           <br/>
           Others: fly – flare
           <br/>
           Alliteration Examples:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Bouncing balloon, bright bird
           </li>
           <li>
            Dusty dawn, dreamy days
           </li>
           <li>
            Sweet smiles, silver star
           </li>

            Calm cat, crisp crackers
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           These examples showcase alliteration by using the same consonant sound at the beginning of each word in the set.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Based on the poem, the child is imagining looking down from high up in the air, seeing the park and the rooftops of the town.
           <br/>
           The appropriate scene that matches this description is Scene (ii): This scene shows an aerial view of houses and trees, which aligns with the child’s perspective of looking down over the park and rooftops of the town from a high vantage point.

          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Why does the child say that they have to climb a tree first to get onto the kite?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The child says they have to climb a tree first to get onto the kite because the kite is stuck or entangled in the tree. When a kite gets caught in the branches, and the child needs to climb the tree to retrieve it.
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) What are the songs that the child hears when flying atop the kite?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When flying atop the kite, the child imagines hearing the songs of nature including the whistling of the wind as it rushes past.
          </p>
          <p>
           (d) Why did the people look up at the child and stare? If you looked up and saw that, what feelings would you have?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The people looked up at the child and stared because seeing a child flying atop a kite is an unusual, magical, and extraordinary sight. It would be something unexpected and awe-inspiring, capturing their attention and curiosity. If I looked up and saw that, I would feel a mix of amazement and concern. The amazement would come from witnessing such a fantastical scene, like something out of a fairy tale or a dream.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           If I were the kite carrying the child high up in the air, I would tell them to hold on tight and enjoy the view, young adventurer! From up here, they can see the world in a whole new way. Feel the wind in their hair and the freedom of the sky.

            The Kites
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Hello everyone! I’m happy to share with you some details about the Kite Festival. It is a popular festival in India and it takes place during Makar Sankranti in January. People can even be seen flying kites from their terraces and rooftops and taking part in kite flying competitions. This festival is celebrated as Uttarayan in Western India. The festival gives everyone a chance to look at kites of different shapes, sizes, and colours. Gujarat is the main centre of celebrations but Uttarayan is also celebrated in Rajasthan and Telangana. In Karnataka, the Tourism Department has also been organizing the kite festival once each year. Punjab also celebrates this festival of kites during Baisakhi and Basant Panchami. Kite fling is a tradition that is deep-rooted in Indian culture and the Kite Festival is eagerly awaited. This is also a reason why people across India also fly kites to celebrate Independence Day. Happy kite-fling to all of you!

           </li>
           <li>
            With the wind blowing steadily, we struggled at; first to get the kite airborne. But after a few tries, it soared up high, dancing gracefully against the blue sky.

           Now, write a paragraph of about 100 words, with the title –
           <strong>
            I am a Kite.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           As a diamond-shaped kite. My shining body is liked by every person. I am adorned with vibrant blues and greens, complemented by a sparkling golden tail. I often find myself flying high above a lush, green park. I am a kite, a simple yet enchanting creation that dances with the wind and brings joy to those who guide me through the skies. My existence may seem ordinary, but I am filled with a vibrant life and a story to tell.
          </p>
          <p>
           I catch the wind and begin my ascent. The rush of air against my fabric feels exhilarating, and I revel in the freedom of flight. In the sky, I perform loops and dives, dancing gracefully with the wind. I compete with other kites, each one trying to climb higher and higher. The birds sometimes join our aerial ballet, adding to the sense of wonder and adventure. From my vantage point, I can see the world below in a way that is both awe-inspiring and humbling.
          </p>
          <p>
           Flying high above, I feel a profound connection with nature and the elements. The wind is my companion, guiding and supporting me. The sun’s warmth gives me energy, and the vast sky is my playground. I am a symbol of freedom and the joy of simple pleasures. As I dance with the wind, I remind you to find joy in the little things, to cherish moments of playfulness, and to seek out the simple pleasures that make life beautiful.

           Question 1.
           <br/>
           The mention of kites exists in ancient Indian texts. It can be found in the poetry of the thirteenth-century Marathi saint and poet, Namadeva. In his poems or gathas, he called a kite a gudi, and there is a mention that the kites were made from kaagad (paper).
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           <strong>
            The Ancient Tradition of Kites in India:
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The tradition of kite flying in India is ancient, with mentions in historical texts and poetry. In the thirteenth century, the Marathi saint and poet Namadeva referred to kites as qudi in his qathas (poems). Fie described kites as being made from kaagad, meaning paper. This indicates that kite flying was a popular and cherished activity even in ancient times. Namadeva’s poetic references highlight the cultural significance and the joy associated with kite flying in Indian society. This tradition has been passed down through generations, continuing to bring delight and excitement to people of all ages across India.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Create the Frame:
           </strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Measure and cut the dowels. The longer dowel (spine) should be about 24 inches, and the shorter dowel (crossbar) about 20 inches.
           </li>
           <li>
            Lay the shorter dowel across the longer one to form a cross, about one-third of the way down the longer dowel.
           </li>
           <li>
            Secure the two dowels together using string or strong tape at the intersection. Make sure they form a right angle.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Make the Cover:
           </strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Place the frame on the paper or fabric and trace the outline of the kite, leaving an extra inch around the edges for folding.
           </li>
           <li>
            Cut out the kite shape from the paper or fabric.
           </li>
           <li>
            Fold the edges of the paper or fabric over the frame and secure with glue or tape.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Attach the String:
           </strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Cut a piece of string about twice the length of the spine.
           </li>
           <li>
            Tie one end of the string to the top of the spine and the other end to the bottom.
           </li>
           <li>
            Attach another piece of string at the intersection of the dowels for the kite line.
           </li>

          <ul>
           <li>
            Attach the ribbon or fabric to the bottom of the kite. This helps to stabilize the kite in the wind.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           <strong>
