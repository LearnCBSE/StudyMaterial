            Question 1. What are the reasons or causes for excess demand?

            Answer:
           </strong>
           The main reasons for excess demand are apparently the increase in the following components of aggregate demand:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Increase in household consumption demand due to rise in propensity to consume.
           </li>
           <li>
            Increase in private investment demand because of rise in credit facilities.
           </li>
           <li>
            Increase in public (government) expenditure.
           </li>
           <li>
            Increase in export demand.
           </li>
           <li>

          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Effect on General Price Level:
            </strong>
            Excess demand gives a rise to general price level because it arises when aggregate demand is more than aggregate supply at a full employment level. There is inflation in economy showing inflationary gap.
           </li>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Effect on Output:
            </strong>
            Excess demand has no effect on the level of output. Economy is at full employment level and there is no idle capacity in the economy. Hence output can’t increase.
           </li>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Effect on Employment:
            </strong>
            There will be no change in the level of employment also. The economy is already operating at full employment equilibrium, and hence there is no unemployment.
           </li>

            Answer:
           </strong>
           The main reasons for deficient demand are apparently the decrease in four components of aggregate demand:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Decrease in household consumption demand due to fall in propensity to consume.
           </li>
           <li>
            Decrease in private investment demand because of fall in credit facilities.
           </li>
           <li>
            Decrease in public (government) expenditure.
           </li>
           <li>
            Decrease in export demand.
           </li>
           <li>
            Decrease in money supply or decrease in disposable income.

          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Effect on General Price Level:
            </strong>
            Deficient demand causes the general price level to fall because it arises when aggregate demand is less than aggregate supply at full employment level. There is deflation in an economy showing deflationary gap.
           </li>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Effect on Employment:
            </strong>
            Due to deficient demand, investment level is reduced, which causes involuntary unemployment in the economy due to fall in the planned output.
           </li>
           <li>

             Effect on Output:

           </li>
           <li>
            During inflation, government should curtail (reduce) its expenditure on public works like roads, buildings, irrigation works thereby reducing the money income of the people and their demand for goods and services.

            Answer:
           </strong>
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Business and traders get credit from commercial bank against the security of their goods. Bank never gives credit equal to the full value of the security. It always pays less value
            <br/>
            than the security.
           </li>
           <li>
            So, the difference between the value of security and value of loan is called marginal requirement.
           </li>
           <li>
            In a situation of deficient demand leading to deflation, central bank decreases marginal requirements. This encourages borrowing because it makes people get more credit against their securities.

            In the above diagram full employment level of national income is attained at point E, but due to deficient demand, aggregate demand shifts downward from AD to AD0 and hew equilibrium is attained at point E1; which is below full employment level. The aggregate demand shifts downward because of the following reasons.
            <br/>
            (i) Decrease in household consumption demand due to fall in propensity to consume.
            <br/>

            (i) Repo rate is the. rate at which commercial bank borrow money from the central bank for short period by selling their financial securities to the central bank.
            <br/>
            (ii) These securities are pledged as a security for the loans.
            <br/>
            (iii) It is called Repurchase rate as this involves commercial bank selling securities to RBI to borrow the money with an agreement to repurchase them at a later date and at a predetermined price.
            <br/>
            (iv) So, keeping securities and borrowing is repo rate.

            (v) In a situation of excess demand leading to inflation,
            <br/>
            • Central bank raises repo rate that discourages commercial banks in borrowing from central bank as it will increase the cost of borrowing of commercial bank.
            <br/>
            • It forces the commercial banks to increase their lending rates, which discourages borrowers from taking loans, which discourages investment.

            • Again high rate of interest induces households to increase their savings by restricting expenditure on consumption.

            Question 1. Depression is a high-handed monster, and if handled carefully it is not so troublesome. Comment. [3 Marks]

          <ol>
           <li>
            Depression reflects slowdown of economic activities on all fronts and therefore is a cause of concern for the government and society at large.
           </li>
           <li>
            However, if tackled carefully taking appropriate monetary and fiscal measures, it may prove useful.

           <li>
            As it has happened in 1929 in America, and also in the years from 2008 to 2012 in the context of slow down of the Indian economy.

            Question 2. Small investors (such as households) deposit their savings to sustain their livelihood present and futurd, but government reduces interest rate for boosting economy. This is inequitable. How? [3-4 Marks]

            Answer:
           </strong>
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Households mobilize their savings and deposits it in the banks to earn
            <br/>
            interest for meeting their current and future needs.
           </li>
           <li>
            If there is a fall in the interest rate, they get less interest, and, hence, find it difficult to sustain their livelihood.
           </li>
           <li>
            But, on the other hand, RBI thinks of reducing interest rate for boosting the climate of investment.
           </li>
           <li>
            There is a contradiction between the two, because increase in investment promotes aggregate demand and output while savings is a leakage from flow of income, and it should be resolved in a manner so that no one suffers.

            Question 3. Monetary measures controlling the situations of inflationary and deflationary gaps are confined only to regular and white transactions. They do not reflect the real situation. Comment. [3 Marks]
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           In India, in unorganized sectors.such as small industries and agriculture, there are vast activities relating to aggregate demand and aggregate supply which are not reflected while assessing the gaps. It is because of these activities that the slowdown effect, that affected a considerable part of the world in 2008, did not affect India.
