            How did nationalism emerge in Vietnam through the efforts of different sections of society to fight against the French? Analyse.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.

           Nationalism in Vietnam emerged through the efforts of different sections of the society:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            The colonisation of Vietnam by the French brought the people of the country into conflict with the colonisers in all areas of life. Nationalist resistance developed when the French troops landed in Vietnam.
           </li>
           <li>
            Schools became an important place for cultural and political battles. Students played a major role by travelling outside Vietnam to Japan to acquire modem education. Their main aim was to seek foreign help to overthrow the puppet emperor and re¬establish the Nguyen dynasty. By 1920s, students were forming various political parties such as Party of Young Annan and publishing journals such as Annanese Student to promote patriotic feelings.
           </li>
           <li>
            Teachers and students did not accept the French curriculum in schools. Teachers spread nationalism by modifying texts and criticising what was stated in the textbooks.
           </li>
           <li>
            During the nationalist movement, a new image of womanhood emerged. Political thinkers and writers began idealising women rebels of the past. Many women joined the resistance movement. They helped in nursing the wounded, constructing underground rooms and tunnels and even shot down 15 enemy fighter-planes.
           </li>
           <li>
            Religious scholars opposed the presence and spread of Christianity by French Christian missionaries.

            Question.12. Classify industries on the basis of capital investment. How are they different from one another? Explain with examples.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer
           </strong>
           . On the basis of capital investment industries can be classified as:
           <br/>
           (i) Small-scale industry (ii) Large-scale industry
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Difference:
           </strong>
           <br/>
           If the investment is more than one crore rupees in any industry, it is considered as a large scale industry. For example, Iron and Steel industry, Cement industry.
           <br/>
           If the investment is less than one crore rupees in any industry, it is considered as a small scale industry. For example, Plastic industry, Toy industry.

           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer
           </strong>
           .
           <strong>
            Money as a medium of exchange for goods and services:
           </strong>
           <br/>
           A person holding money can easily exchange it for any commodity or service that he or she might want. Everyone prefers to receive payments in money and exchange the money for things they want.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            For example:
           </strong>
           A shoemaker wants to sell shoes in the market and buy wheat. The shoe maker will first exchange shoes for money and then exchange the money for wheat. If the shoemaker had to directly exchange shoes for wheat without the use of money, he would have to look for a wheat growing farmer who not only wants to sell wheat but also wants to buy the shoes in exchange. Both the parties have to agree to sell and buy each other’s commodities. This process is very difficult, time consuming and unhealthy.

           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           The credit activities of the informal sector should be discouraged because:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            85% of loans taken by the poor households in the urban areas are from informal sources. There is no organisation that supervises the credit activities of lenders in the informal sector.
           </li>
           <li>
            Informal lenders charge very high interest on their loans. They try to charge more and more interest on their loans as there are no boundaries and restrictions.
           </li>
           <li>
            Higher cost of borrowing means a larger part of the earnings of the borrowers is used to repay the loan.
           </li>
           <li>
            In certain cases, the high interest .rate for borrowing can mean that the amount to be repaid is greater than the income of borrower. This could lead to increasing debt and debt trap, therefore the credit activities of the informal sector should be discouraged.

           <strong>
            Answer.

           <strong>
            Effect of the War on Vietnam:
           </strong>
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            US entry into the war proved costly to the Vietnamese as well as to Americans. The phase of struggle with the US was brutal.
           </li>
           <li>
            From 1965-1972, many (over 403100) US personnel served in Vietnam out of which 7484 were women. Many died in battle and a large number of people were wounded.
           </li>
           <li>
            Thousands of US troops arrived equipped with heavy weapons and tanks backed by most powerful bombers of the time—B52s. The widespread attacks and use of chemical weapons—Napalm, Agent Orange and Phosphorous bombs destroyed many villages and decimated jungles. Civilians died in large numbers.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Effect of the US involvement on life within the US:
           </strong>
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Most of the people were critical of the government’s policy of war. When the youths were drafted (forced recruitment) for the war, the anger grew.
           </li>
           <li>
            Compulsory service in the armed forces could be waived only for university graduates. This meant many of those sent to fight did not belong to the privileged elite, but were minorities and children of working class families which created a lot of resentment.
           </li>
           <li>
            US media played a major role in both supporting and criticising the war. Hollywood made films in support of the war. (Example: John Wayne’s Green Berets; 1968). The film was taken as a war propaganda film, responsible for motivating many young men to die in the war. Other films were more critical. (Example: John Ford Coppola’s Apocalypse Now 1979 reflected the moral confusion that the war caused in the US).

            Importance of Petroleum in India:

           <li>
            It is the second most important energy source of India after coal. It can be easily transported by pipelines and does not leave any residue. This property of petroleum gives it an added advantage in its use over other fuels.
           </li>
           <li>
            It provides fuel for heat and light.
           </li>
           <li>
            It provides lubricants for machinery.
           </li>
           <li>
            It provides raw material for a number of manufacturing industries.
           </li>
           <li>
            It is an important fuel used in transportation sector.
           </li>
           <li>
            Petroleum refineries act as a ‘nodal industry’ for synthetic textiles, fertilizers and many chemical industries.

           <strong>
            Occurrence of Petroleum in India:
           </strong>
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Most of the petroleum occurrences in India are associated with anticlines and fault traps in the rock formations of the tertiary age.
           </li>
           <li>
            In regions of folding anticlines it occurs where oil is trapped in the crest of the up fold. The oil bearing layer is porous limestone or sandstone through which oil may flow.
           </li>
           <li>
            Petroleum is also found in fault traps between porous and non-porous rocks.

           See Q. 28, 2014 (I Outside Delhi).
           <br/>
           Example: In the festive season, a shoe manufacturer, Ram receives an order from a large trader in town for 3,000 pairs of shoes to be delivered in a month’s time. To complete production on time Ram has to hire workers for stitching and pasting work. He has to purchase the raw materials. To meet these expenses Ram obtains loans from two sources. First, he asks the leather supplier to supply leather now and promises to pay him later. Second, he obtains loan in cash from the large traders as advance payment for 1000 pairs of shoes with a promise to deliver the whole order by the end of the month.
           <br/>
           At the end of the month, Salim is able to deliver the order, make a good profit and repay the money he had borrowed.
           <br/>
           Salim obtains credit to meet the working capital needs of production. The credit helps him to meet the ongoing expenses of production, complete production on time and thus increase his earnings. Credit therefore plays a vital and positive role in this situation.

           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Democratic government is a legitimate government. It may be slow, less efficient, not always very responsive or clean. But a democratic government is peoples’ own government. That is why there is an overwhelming support for the idea of democracy all over the world. People’s wish to be ruled by representatives elected by them. As a democratic government is peoples’ own government, they believe that democracy is suitable for their country as it is a legitimate government. Democracy’s ability to generate its own support is itself an outcome that cannot be ignored.

           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Globalisation has led to integration of markets across countries. The Indian markets are now flooded with a wide ranging choice of goods. Import from other countries has led to an expanding choice of goods beyond what is domestically produced —:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            We have a wide variety of goods and services before us in the market.
           </li>
           <li>
            The latest models of digital cameras, mobile phones and televisions made by leading manufacturers of the world like Sony, Samsung etc. are available in the market.
           </li>
           <li>

           </li>
           <li>

           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Sugar industries are concentrated in the sugarcane producing areas because:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            The raw material used in the sugar mills ,t.e., sugarcane is bulky and perishable.
           </li>
           <li>
            It cannot be transported to long distances because its sucrose content dries up fast, so it should be processed within 24 hours of harvest.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Challenges faced by the sugar industry in India are:
           </strong>
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Seasonal nature of the industry.
           </li>
           <li>
            Old and inefficient methods of production.
           </li>
           <li>
            Delays in transportation of cane to the factories.
           </li>
           <li>
            The need to maximize the use of bagasse.

           <strong>
            Question.25. “All over the world, people express their dissatisfaction with the failure of political parties to perform their functions well.” Analyse the statement with arguments.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Since parties are the most visible face in a democracy, people blame them for whatever is wrong with the working of democracy.
           <br/>
           There are four major areas where the working of political parties faces challenge:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Lack of internal democracy. There is concentration of power in one or a few leaders at the top. Parties do not hold organisational meetings and do not conduct internal elections regularly. More than loyalty to party principles and policies, it is personal loyalty which becomes more important.
           </li>
           <li>
            Dynastic succession. In many parties, top positions are always held by members of one family. Most political parties do not practice transparent and open procedures for their functioning and it is very difficult for an ordinary worker to rise to the top. This is bad for democracy, since people who do not have adequate experience or popular support come to occupy positions of power.
           </li>
           <li>
            Money and muscle power. Since parties are focussed only on winning elections, they tend to use short-cuts to win elections. They nominate candidates who have or can raise money and thus are able to have influence on the policies and decisions of the party.
           </li>
           <li>
            No meaningful choice. There has been a decline in the ideological differences among parties. They agree more on fundamental aspects, but differ only in details, on how policies are to be framed and implemented. Sometimes people cannot even elect different leaders as the same set of leaders keep shifting from one party to another.
           </li>
          </ol>

            Answer.
           </strong>
           In sedimentary rocks a number of minerals occur in beds or layers. They have been formed as a result of deposition, accumulation and concentration in horizontal stratas.

           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Most of the informal lenders charge a much higher interest on loans than the formal sector loans.

            Question.17. “Nearly every one of the state parties wants to get an opportunity to be a part of one or the other national level coalition.” Support the statement with arguments.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           The state parties also referred to as regional parties are not necessarily regional in ideology. Some of these parties are all India parties that happen to have succeeded only in some states. Over the last three decades, the number and strength of these parties has expanded. Before the general elections one national party was able to secure on its own a majority in the Lok Sabha.
           <br/>
           As a result, the national parties were compelled to form alliances with state parties.
           <br/>
           Since 1996, nearly every one of the state parties got an opportunity to be a part of one or the other national level coalition government. This contributed to the strengthening of federalism and democracy. Example of state parties having national level political organisation with units in several states are Samajwadi Party (SP), Rashtriya Janata Dal, Samata Party.

            Question.18. “Consumer awareness is essential to avoid exploitation in the market place.” Support the statement.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Consumer awareness is essential to avoid exploitation in the market place. Markets do not work in a fair manner. Exploitation happens in various ways. Therefore, awareness is essential. Certain details are given on the packing of all commodities. When we buy medicines, details are marked on the packets. Rules have been made so that the manufacturer displays the information. Consumers who are not aware may buy, for example,
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            medicines that have not been properly inspected and certified by the appropriate authority, or whose expiry date is already over,
           </li>
           <li>
            They may buy electronic/ electrical goods which may have defects or these products may not adhere to safety norms. Consumers can complain and ask for compensation or replacement of the product, if it proves to be defective in any manner.

            Question.23. What is trade? Explain the importance of international trade.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           The exchange of goods among people, states and countries is referred to as trade. Importance of international trade:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            International trade of a country is an index to its economic prosperity.
           </li>
           <li>
            It is considered the economic barometer for a country. If the balance of international trade is favourable, a country will be able to earn more foreign exchange.
           </li>
           <li>
            As no country is self-sufficient in all resources it cannot survive without international trade.
           </li>
           <li>
            Countries have trade relations with the major trading blocks.
           </li>
           <li>
            Exchange of commodities and goods have been superseded by the exchange of information and knowledge.
           </li>
