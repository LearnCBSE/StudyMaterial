            Let us write (Page 91)

          </p>
          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read how the bird perceived its world.
           <br/>
           My world was small, round, and light blue at first. After that, my world was warm and comfortable. It was made of straw. In this world, I could only see leaves whenever I stepped out. In the end, my world became big. It had the sky and the earth as a part of it.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When the bird was a baby, she thought her nest was the world, where she was secure with her mother. Later when she grew the thought about the world changed to green leaves. She flew as an adult and found the world very, very big.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Now, discuss with your teacher and classmates how you think the world would look to the following.
           <br/>
           (a) a baby
           <br/>
           (b) a fish
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (a) Baby (Written in first person)
           </strong>
           <br/>
           I am surrounded by relatives, who love and care for me. Everybody gives me gifts, I love them. My mother feeds me on time. She kisses me and changes my clothes. I am the source of entertainment for all in my family.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            (b) Fish
           </strong>
           <br/>
           I live in the water and feed on water weeds and worms. I have my family and friends with whom I enjoy a lot. We move in groups from one place to another, but I need to be careful, not to get trapped in the fisherman’s net. I have to be also careful of the larger fishes that can feed on me. I love my home and my family.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Now, write five sentences each, for both (a) and (b), in your notebooks. You can take help from the example given in 1.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (a) A Baby
           </strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            My world is small, cozy, and filled with soft blankets and toys.
           </li>
           <li>
            I see the faces of my parents and they make me feel safe and loved.
           </li>
           <li>
            My world is made up of warm bottles of milk and gentle lullabies.
           </li>
           <li>
            As I grow, my world expands to include colorful picture books and playful sounds.
           </li>
           <li>
            Eventually, my world will include new places like the park and the neighborhood, where I can explore and learn.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           <strong>

          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            My world is a small, round tank filled with clear water and decorative pebbles.
           </li>
           <li>
            I see the shimmering light that filters through the water, creating beautiful patterns.
           </li>
           <li>
            My world is made of plants and tiny hiding places where I can rest.
           </li>
           <li>
            Whenever I swim to the surface, I see the faces of humans who feed me.
           </li>
           <li>
            In the end, my world includes the larger aquarium, where I can swim freely and explore new areas.

          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           The bird’s first home was made of a shell. Later its home was among leaves and made of straw.
           <br/>
           • Look at your home carefully and make a list of all the materials it is made of.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           My home is made of brick, cement, and iron.
          </p>
          <p>
           • Why do you think our homes are not made of straw?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Our homes cannot be made of straw because they will get wet with the rain. It will be a weak house and will not be able to support our weight. We will not be able to cook our food as straws will catch fire easily.
          </p>
          <p>
           • If you had to own a home of your choice, what would it look like and what materials would you like to use?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           People use cement, bricks, wood, iron, etc. to build their homes.

          </p>
          <p>
           • How is a home different from a house? Discuss with your classmates and teacher.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A home is a place where you live comfortably with your family. A house is made of bricks or stones or mud. It is only a shelter.
          </p>
          <p>
           • Look at the list of some workers who build houses. Find out the work they do and write, as shown in the example. You can think of other workers and add them too.

           Description: A nest is built inside a hole in a tree trunk.
           <br/>
           Birds: Woodpeckers, owls, and some parrots use tree cavities for nesting.
           <br/>
           Personal Observation: These nests provide excellent protection from predators and the elements. Have you seen any trees with holes that might be homes for birds?
