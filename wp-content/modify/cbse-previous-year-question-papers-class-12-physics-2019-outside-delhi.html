           Question 6.
           <br/>
           A capacitor made of two parallel plates, each of area ‘A’ and separation W is charged by an external d.c.-source. Show that during charging, the displacement current inside the capacitor is the same as the current charging the capacitor. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 Physics 2019 Outside Delhi 7" height="138" loading="lazy" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48526878337_5cf5fe6315_o.png" width="219"/>

           From Ampere’s law,
           <br/>
           \(\oint \mathrm{B} d l=\mu_{0} i(t)\)
           <br/>
           Let the case-1, where a point P is considered outside the capacitor charging.
           <br/>
           From Ampere’s law magnetic field at point P will be :
           <br/>

           <br/>
           Now, take case-2 where shape of surface under consideration covers capacitor’s plate as we consider there is no current through capacitor then this value of B will be zero.
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 Physics 2019 Outside Delhi 9" height="185" loading="lazy" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48526722546_9f9a63ed7f_o.png" width="255"/>
           <br/>
           Case-2
           <br/>
           Hence, there is a contradiction.
           <br/>
           Therefore, this Ampere’s law was modified with addition of displacement current inside capacitor.
           <br/>

           Question 11.
           <br/>
           Under which conditions can a rainbow be observed? Distinguish between a primary and a secondary rainbow. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           The rainbow is an example of the dispersion of sunlight by the water drops in the atmosphere. This is a phenomenon due to combined effect of dispersion, refraction and reflection of Sunlight by spherical water droplets of rain. The conditions for observing a rainbow are that the Sun should be shining in one part of the sky (say near western horizontal while it is raining in the opposite part of the sky (say eastern horizon).

           Question 12.
           <br/>
           Explain the following : [2]
           <br/>
           (a) Sky appears blue.
           <br/>
           (b) The Sun appears reddish at
           <br/>
           (i) sunset,
           <br/>
           (ii) sunrise.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Light from the sun reaches the atmosphere that is comprised of the tiny particles of the atmosphere. These act as a prism and cause the different components to scatter. As blue light travels in shorter and smaller waves in comparison to the other colours of spectrum. It is scattered the most , causing the sky to appear bluish.

          </div>
          <p>
           (b) The molecules of the atmosphere and other particles that are smaller than the longest wavelength of visible light are more effective in scattering light of shorter wavelengths than light of longer wavelengths. The amount of scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength. (Rayleigh Effect) Light from the Sun near the horizon passes through a greater distance in the Earth’s atmosphere than does the light received when the Sun is overhead. The correspondingly greater scattering of short wavelengths accounts for the reddish appearance of the Sun at rising and at setting.

           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           By heavily doping both p and n sides of the junction, depletion region formed is very thin, i.e. &lt; 10
           <sup>
            6
           </sup>
           m. Hence, electric field across the junction is very high (~5 × 10

           (b) How is a toroid different from a solenoid?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Cyclotron : Cyclotron is a device by which the positively charged particles like protons, deutrons, etc. can be accelerated.
           <br/>
           Principle : Cyclotron works on the principle that a positively charged particle can be accelerated by making it to cross the same electric field repeatedly with the help of a magnetic field.
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 Physics 2019 Outside Delhi 25" height="305" loading="lazy" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48526723186_e250e6f642_o.png" width="364"/>

           , which are called Dees They are enclosed in an evacuated chamber.
          </p>
          <p>
           Chamber is kept between the poles of a powerful magnet so that uniform magnetic field acts perpendicular to the plane of the dees. An alternating voltage is applied in the gap between the two dees by the help of a high frequency oscillator. The electric field is zero inside the dees.

           be positive and D

           <br/>
           From the above equation it follows that frequency f is independent of both v and r and is called cyclotron frequency. Also if we make the frequency of applied a.c. equal to f, then every time the proton reaches the gap between the dees, the direction of electric field is reversed and proton receives a push and finally it gains very high kinetic energy. The proton follows a spiral path and finally gets directed towards the target and comes out from it

           <br/>
           (b) Toroid is a form in which a conductor is wound around a circular body. In this case we get magnetic field inside the core but poles are absent because circular body don’t have ends. Toroid is used in toroidal inductor, toroidal transformer.
           <br/>
           Solenoid is a form in which conductor is wound around a cylindrical body with limb. In this case magnetic field creates two poles N and S. Solenoids have some flux leakage. This is used in relay, motors, electro-magnetes

Describe briefly how the large angle scattering explains the existence of the nucleus inside the atom, Explain with the help of impact parameter picture, how Rutherford scattering serves a powerful way to determine and upper limit on the size of the nucleus.

           <br/>
           From the plot it is clear that Most of the a-particles passed through the foil,, only 0.14% of the incident a particles scatter by more than 1% and about 1 in 8000 deflect by more than 90° a-particles deflected backward due to strong repulsive force. This force will come from positive charge concentrated at the center as most of the particles get deflected by small angles.
          </p>
          <p>
           The α-particles trajectory depends on collision’s impact parameter (b) for a given beam of a-particles, distribution of impact parameters as beam gets scattered in different directions with different probabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
           fig.2 shows a-particle close to nucleus suffers large scattering. Impact parameter is minimum for head on collision a-particles rebound by 180°. Impact parameter is high, for undeviated a-particles. With deflection angle = 0°.
          </p>
          <p>
           As these of nucleus was 10

           <sup>
            -10
           </sup>
           m size of an atom which is 10,000 to 100,000 times larger hence most of the space is empty, only small % of the incident particles rebound back indicates that number of α-particle goes head on collision. Hence most of the mass of the atom is concentrated in small volume. Thus, Rutherford scattering is a strong tool to determine upper limit to the size of the nucleus.

           decay both are neutral particles. With very little or no mass. These particles are emitted from the nucleus along with the electron or positron during the decay process. Neutrions interact very weakly with matter, they can even penetrate the earth without being absorbed. It is for this reason that their detection is extremely difficult and their presence went unnoticed for long.

           Decay constant:
           <br/>
           Decay constant of a radioactive element is the reciprocal of time during which the number of atoms left in the sample reduces to 1/r times the number of atoms in the original sample.

           Derivation of mean life :
           <br/>
           Let us consider, No be the total number of radioactive atoms present initially. After time t, total no. of atoms present (undecayed) be N. In further dt time dN be the no. of atoms disintegrated. So, the life of dN atoms ranges lies between t + dt and dt. Since, dt is very small time, the most appropriate life of dN atom is t. So the total life of N atom = f.dN

           <br/>
           Now, substituting the value of dN and changing the limit in equation (i) from (ii) we get

           <br/>
           This expression gives the relation between mean life and decay constant. Hence, mean life is reciprocal of decay constant.

           Question 22.

           A triangular prism of refracting angle 60° is made of a transparent material of refractive index 2/√3. A ray of light is incident normally on the face KL as shown in the figure. Trace the path of the ray as it passes through the prism and calculate the angle of emergence and angle of deviation. [3]

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           From diagram it is clear that incidence angle at face KM is 60°.
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 Physics 2019 Outside Delhi 45" height="358" loading="lazy" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48526927081_24dd5c2809_o.png" width="335"/>
           <br/>
           Hence, critical angle is also 60°.
           <br/>
           Therefore, incident light ray will not emerge from KM face due to total internal reflection at this face. Hence, it will move along face KM Angle of emergence = 90°.
           <br/>
           Hence angle of deviation = 30° (from fig.)

           Prove that in a common-emitter amplifier, the output and input differ in phase by 180°. In a transistor, the change of base current by 30 µA produces change of 0 02 V in the base-emitter voltage and a change of 4 mA in the collector current. Calculate the current amplification factor and the load resistance used, if the voltage gain of the amplifier is 400. [3]

           Using the expression for the resistivity in . terms of number density and relaxation time between the collisions, explain how resistivity in the case of a conductor increases while it decreases in a semiconductor, with the rise of temperature. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 Physics 2019 Outside Delhi 46" height="323" loading="lazy" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48527098307_5db2776f63_o.png" width="444"/>

           n → number of free electrons
           <br/>
           t → Average time between collisions.
           <br/>
           In metals n is not dependent on temperature to any appreciable extent and thus the decrease in the value of x with rise in temperature causes p to increases.
          </p>
          <p>
           for semiconductors, n increases with temperature. This increases more than compensates any decrease in t, so that for such materials, p decreases with temperature.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) As the armature coil is rotated in the magnetic field, angle 0 between the field and normal to the coil changes continuously. Therefore, magnetic flux linked with the coil changes. An e.m.f. is induced in the coil. According to Fleming’s right hand rule, current induced in AB is from A to B and it is from C to D in CD in the external circuit current flows from B

           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Under what conditions does the phenomenon of total internal reflection take place? Draw a ray diagram showing how a ray of light deviates by 90° after passing through a right-angled isosceles prism. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The phenomenon of total internal reflection occurs when,
          </p>

            i ≥ C
           </li>
           <li>
            When light travels from more denser medium to less denser medium.In case of right angle isosceles triangle if light rays fall normally on AB then light incident of face AC with angle of incidence &gt; critical angle.

           Question 8.
           <br/>
           What is the reason to operate photo-diodes in reverse bias?
           <br/>
           A p-n photo diode is fabricated from a semiconductor with a band gap of range of 2.5 to 2.8 eV. Calculate the range of wavelengths of the radiation which can be detected by the photo diode. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer : Photo diode are reverse biased for working in photo-conductive mode. This reduces the response time because the additional reverse bias increases the width of the depletion layer, which decreases the junction capacitance. The reverse bias also increases the dark current without much change in the photo current.
           <br/>

           <br/>
           Optical fiber works on principle of total internal reflection. When angle of incidence is greater than Critical angle then incident rays are totally reflected back in same media.
           <br/>
           When, θ
           <sub>
            i
           </sub>
           &gt; θ
           <sub>
            c
           </sub>
           , Total internal reflection occurs and if θ
           <sub>
            i
           </sub>
           &lt; θ
           <sub>
            c
           </sub>
           , refraction occurs.
           <br/>
           Application: Optical fiber are used for communication due to very high bandwidth of media.

           Question 4.
           <br/>
           How are electromagnetic waves produced by oscillating charges ? What is the source of the energy associated with the em waves [2]
           <br/>
           Answer : Oscillating charges are responsible for generation of periodically varying electric field in the space. The oscillating charges generate varying electric current which in turn is responsible for the generation of periodical varying magnetic field. This way the electromagnetic waves are generated.
