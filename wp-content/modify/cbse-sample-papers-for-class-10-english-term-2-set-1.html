           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below.
           <br/>
           Technology is making advancements at a rapid rate but at the cost of a valued tradition—the crafts industry. The traditional crafts industry is losing a lot of its trained and skilled craftsmen. With that, the art of embellishing brass and 5. copper utensils with fine engravings is also disappearing. The government has identified around 35 crafts as languishing craft.
          </p>
          <p>
           The speciality of handcrafted items is its design, an association with long traditions belonging to a specific region. The word ‘handcrafted’ does not imply the involvement of dexterous human fingers or an agile mind with a moving 10. spirit anymore. Lessening drudgery, increasing production and promoting efficiency have taken precedence. The labour-saving devices are taking the place of handcrafted tools and this has jeopardized the skills of these artisans.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           Mechanisation has made its way into 15. everything-cutting, polishing, edging, designing etc. Ideally, the use of machinery should be negligible and the handicrafts should be made purely by hand with a distinguishable artistic appeal. However, with the exception of small-scale industries, the export units are mostly operated by machines. The heavily computerised designs contribute to a faster production at lower costs.
          </p>
          <p>
           20. Although mechanization of crafts poses a challenge to safeguarding traditional crafts, the artisans are lured with incentives in order to impart handicrafts training. Some makers do see machines as a time-saving blessing since they are now able to accomplish difficult and demanding tasks with relative ease.
          </p>
          <p>
           25. These machines might give a better finesse to these products but they don’t stand out as handcrafted. Quantity has overtaken quality in this industry.
           <br/>
           A need to highlight the importance of the hand-made aspect is required by both the government and private sectors, in order to amplify awareness and also support the culture of making handicrafts. A few artisans 30. are still trying their best to rejuvenate and revive their culture and heritage but it’s an uphill task competing with the machine- made goods. A multitude of artisans have changed their professions and are encouraging their progeny to follow suit. There are others who have stayed their ground but are clearly inclined towards buying machines.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           35. Nearly two decades ago, there were around 65 lakh artisans in the country. Three years ago, when the government started the process of granting a unique number to the artisans based on the Aadhaar card, 25 lakhs were identified. Loss of traditional crafts is clearly a worrying issue, but it stands to reason that forcing any artisan to follow old ways when concerns of livelihood overrule other considerations, is unfair.
          </p>
          <p>
           On the basis of your understanding of the passage, answer ANY FIVE questions from the six given below. (1 × 5 )

           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            valued – showcase talents that are associated with artisans’ lifestyle and history
           </li>
           <li>
            tradition – represent rich our artistic culture / heritage / tradition
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Detail Explanation:
           <br/>
           The writer calls handicrafts a ‘valued tradition’ as it shows the talents of the artisans and represents their rich artistic culture, life style, heritage and tradition.
          </p>
          <p>
           (B) Rewrite the following sentence by replacing the underlined phrase with a word that means the same from lines (5-15).
           <br/>
           If it continues, the workcation (work + vacation) trend will be a powerful boost to domestic tourism operators failing to make progress in the economic slump caused due to the pandemic. (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           If it continues, the workcation (work + vacation) trend will be a powerful boost to domestic tourism operators languishing in the economic slump caused due to the pandemic.
          </p>
          <p>
           Detail Explanation:
           <br/>

          <div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           (C) State any two reasons why artisans are choosing to work via machines rather than handcrafted tools. (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Saves labour / reduces drudgery / increases production / finesse / effciency
          </p>
          <p>
           Detail Explanation:
           <br/>
           Artisans choose to work via machines as they can now accomplish difficult and demanding tasks relatively easily. The machines save them time and labour, reduce drudgery and increase production. Besides, the machines sometimes give a better finesse to these products.
          </p>
          <p>
           (D) Why do the artisans need to be ‘lured with incentives’ to impart handicrafts training? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Because if artisans impart training to mass/bulk producers, they run the risk of losing their traditional livelihood to them and hence need to be tempted via benefits or rewards, to do so.
           <br/>
           Detail Explanation: Though imparting training to mass/bulk producers runs the risk of losing their traditional livelihood, artisans have to be Lured with incentives to provide handicrafts training and keep the custom alive.
          </p>
          <p>
           (E) List one likely impact of the support of government and private sectors towards the culture of making handicrafts. (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Creation of awareness and public support for the artisans and their work / more artisans would be incentivised to continue their tradition / artisans wouldn’t change their professions seeking better livelihood
          </p>
          <p>
           Detail Explanation:
           <br/>
           Government and private sectors have been discreetly creating support and public awareness to support the artisans and their work. This way artisans would be incentivised to continue with their profession and tradition and wouldn’t change their professions seeking better livelihood.
          </p>
          <p>
           (F) How does the writer justify an artist’s act of abandoning her/his traditional craft for a more lucrative option? 1
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Via the argument that the artisans cannot be expected to continue their profession if it is not profitable, even though the loss of traditional crafts is perturbing.
          </p>
          <p>
           Detail Explanation:
           <br/>
           To justify the artisans’ act of abandoning his/her traditional craft for a more lucrative option, the writer puts up the argument that the artisans cannot be expected to continue their profession if it is not profitable, even though the loss of traditional crafts is disturbing.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Read the following excerpt from a case study titled Impacts of Festivities on Ecology.
           <br/>
           Festivals are synonymous with celebration, ceremony and joy. Howeve festivals bring to fore the flip side of celebrations – pollution – air, water, soil and noise. This led to the need of assessing the awareness level among people about ecological pollution during festivals. So, a study was conducted by scholars of an 5. esteemed university in India. This study was titled “Awareness Towards Impact Festivals on Ecology.”
          </p>
          <p>
           There were two main objectives of the study. The first one was to assess the awareness level among people about ecological protection during festivities, exploring solutions to bring awareness about celebrating festivals without 10. harming ecology was the second objective. The method used to collect data was a simple questionnaire containing 6 questions, shared with 50 respondents across four selected districts of a state in the southern region of India.
          </p>
          <p>
           The research began by understanding the socio-economic conditions of the respondents before sharing the questionnaire. Once the 15. responses were received, the data collected was tabulated (Table 1), for analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
           Table-1: Awareness level among respondents
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 10 English Term 2 Set 1 with Solutions 1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-133100" height="674" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-English-Term-2-Set-1-with-Solutions-1.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-English-Term-2-Set-1-with-Solutions-1.png 324w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-English-Term-2-Set-1-with-Solutions-1-144x300.png 144w" width="324"/>
           <br/>
           The study recommended the imposition of strict rules and regulations as opposed to a total ban on all festive activities which have a drastic impact on our environment. The researchers believed that such measures would help in harnessing some ill-effects that add to the growing pollution and suggest 20. further studies be taken up across the country to assess awareness about ecological degradation.
          </p>
          <p>
           The observations made in the study pointed to the environmental groups and eco-clubs fighting a losing battle due to city traffic issues, disposal of plastics, garbage dumping and all sorts of ecological degradation. The 25. researchers stressed that the need of the hour is increasing awareness among reduce ecological pollution which can be facilitated by celebrating all festivals in an eco-friendly manner.
          </p>
          <p>
           On the basis of your understanding of the passage, answer ANY FIVE questions from the six given below. (1 × 5)
           <br/>
           (A) Why do the researchers call pollution the ‘flip side’ of festivals? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           because the accepted norm is that festivals are synonymous with celebration/joy and people fail to see the other side, which is pollution
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           festivals and pollution are two sides of the same coin currently/ polar opposites/ completely in contrast, yet together with each other—where we associate festivals with joy and celebration, we can’t deny that pollution is an ignored reality
          </p>
          <p>
           Detail Explanation:
           <br/>
           Unfortunately, festivals and pollution go hand-in-hand. Though festivals are all about celebrations, fun and laughter, today it is (in many ways) traumatizing the mother earth with the litter left after celebrations. Festivals and pollution are two sides of the same coin, where the latter is an ignored reality.
          </p>
          <p>
           (B) Comment on the significance of the second objective of the study with reference to lines 7-12. (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Second objective- Exploring solutions
           </li>
           <li>
            Significance- important for knowing steps that need to be taken to address the problem investigated in the research/ knowing what are the immediate actions that need to be implemented to address the issue studied/ helps focus on what needs to be corrected and what needs to be avoided to solve the problem focused on in the research
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Detail Explanation:
           <br/>
           Second objective is exploring solutions, to bring awareness about celebrating festivals without harming the ecology. To understand and focus on what needs to be corrected and what needs to be avoided, and then give the solution for the problem focused on in the research.
          </p>
          <p>
           (C) Justify the researchers’ recommendation for limiting the drastic impact of festival pollution on the environment with reference to lines 16-21. (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Researcher’s recommendation: Strict rules
           </li>
           <li>
            Justification: Strict rules are better than a total ban because banning does not serve the purpose of awareness/ people do not generally conform to banning and tend to revolt/ strict rules pose some restrictions but still give the needed freedom.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Detail Explanation:
           <br/>
           Researchers recommend enfo. sing strict ruLes to limit the drastic impact of festival pollution. Government should resort to strict rules instead of total ban because people do not conform to banning and tend to oppose it. So also, banning does put the people under some restrictions but gives the much needed freedom.
          </p>
          <p>
           (D) Why do the researchers feel that environmental groups and eco-clubs are fighting a losing battle in the given scenario? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            the festivals cause pollution along with other issues (give examples) that add to it.
           </li>
           <li>
            awareness is the only solution but the lack of it only adds to the problem.
           </li>

           Detail Explanation:
           <br/>
           In the study, the environmental groups and eco-clubs aren’t succeeding in their battle against pollution because of unregulated disposal of plastics, garbage dumping, city traffic issues and all sorts of ecological degradation that happens during the festival season. The need of the hour is to sensitize the masses and increase the awareness on celebrating the festivals in an eco-friendly manner.
          </p>
          <p>
           (E) Even though a larger number of people say ‘no’ to bursting crackers than those who say ‘yes’, festival pollution persists. How does evidence from Table 1 support this statement? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            a large percentage of people (72%) abuse environmental resources to celebrate festivals.
           </li>
           <li>
            a high percentage of people (82%) use crackers to celebrate festivals in order to live up to the expectation of their social status.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Detail Explanation:
           <br/>
           A large percentage of people (72%) abuse environmental resources to celebrate festivals. In spite of a large number of people saying no’ to crackers, pollutions persists as a high percentage of people (82%) use crackers to celebrate festivals in order to live up to the expectation of their social status. It adds to the festival pollution.

           (F) What purpose does the ‘Can’t Say’ column serve in the questionnaire (Table 1)? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           gives a provision to/ allows the respondents to choose not to express/ not to answer/ allows an option to those who lack clarity/ are unwilling to respond.
          </p>
          <p>
           Detail Explanation:
           <br/>

          <p>
           Detail Explanation:
           <br/>
           Setbacks often leave us with a feeling of disappointment and may even lead to acute depression. There are two ways to handle any setback-one for the better, i.e. healthy and the other for the worse, i.e. unhealthy. When we take the setback in a healthy way, we learn from it and let go of the emotions inside. The optimistic approach provides an ability to feel, reflect and align. In other words, we observe the pattern of the setback, especially assess the difficulty of work and possibility of future success by doing the work.
          </p>
          <p>
           In particular, the person reaches a healing state to transform anxiety, shunning away bitter life experiences that are the results of not meeting some particular expectations. On the contrary, a negative approach to setback gives rise to a feeling of inadequacy and incompetency and the affected person is unable to accept the situation. It leads to a vicious cycle of undesirable feelings and the person becomes a victim to self-criticism and self-doubt as opposed to a person with a positive response to setbacks.
          </p>
          <p>
           The victim even resorts to blaming others and sees everything as a danger and threat. So, it is imperative to channelize the thoughts in the right direction and avoid anger, anxiety and depression. A healthy response to setbacks must be seen as a learning opportunity, though it may require some time and efforts.

           Explanation:
           <br/>
           (a) The sentence is in present perfect tense and we use 3rd form of the verb with has/ have. So, learn is not the correct word and we use ‘learnt’.
           <br/>
           (b) The sentence is in present tense and there is no sense of advice or suggestion. So, should is the wrong word and we will use won’t/don’t.
           <br/>
           (c) The complete extract is in present tense, so ‘was’ is the wrong word and the correct word is ‘is’.
           <br/>
           (d) If we understand the sense of the sentence, we will know that the right word is some/ many not all.

           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Read the conversation between a teacher and student and complete the passage that follows. (1 × 2)
           <br/>
           Biology Teacher: I instructed you to draw the diagram of bacteria. Why did you submit a blank sheet?
          </p>
          <p>
           Sameer: Sir, I had drawn the diagram of bacteria, but you can’t see it because it is not visible to the naked eye.
           <br/>
           The biology teacher had instructed Sameer to draw the diagram of a bacterial cell and asked him
           <br/>
           (a) …………… a blank sheet. Sameer respectfully answered that he had drawn the diagram but
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           why he had submitted
          </p>
          <p>
           Detail Explanation:
           <br/>
           If the sentence in the direct speech is in past tense, the verb changes to past perfect tense. The pronoun ‘you changes to ‘he’, hence, did you submit changes to ‘he had submitted’.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) ………….. to the naked eye. (1 + 1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           he/ the teacher couldn’t see it because it was not visible
          </p>
          <p>
           Detail Explanation:
           <br/>
           In the first part of the sentence, there is no change in the indirect speech as it already uses past perfect change and that is not changed. In the second part of the sentence, can’t is changed to ‘couldn’t’ and the pronoun you is changed to ‘he’.

           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Detail Explanation:
           <br/>
           Kisa Gotami came to Buddha asking him to bring back his dead son to life. Buddha asked her to go to the village and bring some mustard seeds from a house where no death had been occured. The condition held a significant meaning that death is universal. One who is born is sure to die. It was only after that that Kisa Gotami realized her folly and came to terms with the will of God.

           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Detail Explanation:
           <br/>
           The poet appreciates the virtues animals possess and that, they were once human virtues. But, now the human beings have forgotten all virtues and have become the victims to innumerable vices such as ego, hypocrisy, hatred, materialism, greed, show off, dissatisfaction, etc. For all these reasons, the poet wishes to live with animals.

           <br/>
           (A) Parents play a crucial role in the upbringing of their children. Critically examine the parents of Bholi and Ebright, highlighting their impact on their children’s lives. (4)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Introductory sentence:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            crucial and indelible role played by parents
           </li>
           <li>
            parents influence their children both implicitly (indirectly) and explicitly (directly)
           </li>
           <li>
            are role models, first teachers, friends, companions, guides
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Critical examination (any 3 – 4)
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Richard H. Ebright’s mother- loving, caring, understanding, a friend, a companion
           </li>
           <li>
            filled the vacuum in Ebright’s life in his father’s absence
           </li>
           <li>
            invested time and energy in his upbringing which made him see heights ofsuccess
           </li>
           <li>
            Bholi’s parents—uncaring, indifferent, biased, insensitive, had a patriarchal mindset
           </li>
           <li>
            traditional outlook—did not believe in the education of girls, totally indifferent to Bholi and her needs, negLected her
           </li>
           <li>
            did not bother to groom her (oil her hair, give her good clothes to wear)
           </li>
           <li>
            sent her to school not to educate her but to save their own face
           </li>
           <li>
            despite their prosperity, they left Bholi to her own misery, worst was when they decided to marry her off to Bishamber (Accept any other relevant content point that lends itself to critical examination)
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Concluding thought:
           <br/>
           The contribution and companionship of parents cannot be denied. Love, care, and guidance from parents make a difference, sculpt children and shapes their future.
          </p>
          <p>
           Detail Explanation:
           <br/>
           It is rightly said that home is the first school for a child and it paves the way for future successes. Richard’s mother was highly compassionate, caring, understanding and supportive. She raised Richard alone and she always was like a companion to him. She was the one who developed in him a curiosity and interest about the world around him. She brought him books that inspired Richard. On the other hand, Bholi’s parents were uneducated, biased and uncaring. The totally neglected Bholi was a simple-looking girl. They didn’t believe in educating girls but sent Bholi to school to save themselves from embarrassment. Though they were prosperous enough, they never gave Bholi good clothes or food. And above all that, they decided to marry Bholi to Bishamber, a man almost twice her age. But thanks to her teacher, Bholi was able to get education and could oppose all the wrongs done to her.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is evident from both the incidents that parents really play a crucial role in shaping the lives of their children. They are the one who guide and motivate their child/children.

           (B) Pranjol and Rajvir discuss their next vacation destination. They shortlist Coorg and Goa. Rajvir is keen on Coorg and tries to convince Pranjol. Develop a conversation between the two, based on your understanding of Glimpses of India.
           <br/>
           You may begin like this:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Rajvir: Hey Pranjol! I think we should be visiting Coorg. It is a beautiful place with coffee plantations. I can smell the aroma already!
           </li>
           <li>
            Pranjol: I gave you the opportunity to explore a tea plantation last year, in Assam; I want to… (4)
            <br/>
            Answer:
           </li>
           <li>
            Rajvir: Hey Pranjol! I think we should be visiting Coorg. It is a beautiful place with coffee plantations. I can smell the aroma already! Pranjol: I gave you the opportunity to explore a tea plantation last year, in Assam; I want to…
           </li>
           <li>
            Rajvir: There is a lot more to do in Coorg than smelling the coffee! The place has rainforests, so the megafauna will be worth watching. Not just this, Coorg provides opportunities to indulge in adventure sports like river rafting, rappelling, mountain biking, to name a few. Pranjol: That sounds interesting, but 1 would prefer some serene moments too, away from this post-pandemic hustle-bustle.
           </li>
           <li>
            Rajvir: Oh! The answer is Coorg again!
           </li>
           <li>
            Pranjol: Oh, come on! You can’t be serious..
           </li>
           <li>
            Rajvir: Believe me, I am. Coorg is the place. It has beautiful natural walking trails and the Brahmagiri hills offer a panoramic view I read that the place has the largest Tibetan settlement, so the environment will reflect peace and spirituality, I’m sure.
           </li>
           <li>
            Pranjol: Have to say, you’ve presented a fine case in favour of Coorg and convinced me. Let’s plan to leave for Coorg next Wednesday!

           Answer
           <br/>
           Introductory sentence:
           <br/>
           farcical characters, their ridiculous and odd behaviour, unlikely and exaggerated situations (profuse in the play)
          </p>
          <p>

          </p>

           <li>
            humour in the play, improbable situations, childish behaviour of the characters (making a mountain out of a molehill), arguments and quarrels

           <li>
            Natalaya’s impulsive and belligerent remarks (Any other relevant evidence)
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Concluding Statement:
           <br/>
           the manner in which the final proposal is made amidst all the chaos, makes the play a farce.
          </p>
          <p>
           Detail Explanation:
           <br/>
           The play The Proposal’ is a farce were the characters behave oddly and in a ridiculous manner. The events are highly exaggerated giving rise to humour. Though the characters are grown up persons, they behave in a childish manner and are indulged in fights and arguments. They start on a good note but ultimately end up hurling abuses at each other. They insult each other like anything over trivial matters. As soon as one controversial topic ends they come up with another. Lomov’s nervous panic attacks, Chubukov’s theatrical statements and reactions, Natalya’s impulsive remarks all add to the humour.
          </p>
          <p>
           Finally, the way the proposal is made amidst all the chaos makes the play a farce.
