            Agent Orange the deadly poison
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Agent Orange is a defoliant, a plant killer, so called because it was stored in drums marked with an orange band. Between 1961 and 1971, some 11 million gallons of this chemical was sprayed from cargo planes by US forces. Their plan was to destroy forests and fields, so that it could be easier to kill, if there was no jungle cover for people to hide in. Over 14 percent of the cultivated fields were affected and are continuing to affect people till today. Dioxin, an element of Agent Orange, is known to cause cancer and brain damage in children and according to a study, is also the cause of the high incidence of deformities found in the sprayed areas.
           <br/>
           The tonnage of bands including chemical arms, used during US intervention (mostly against civilians targets) in Vietnam exceeds that used throughout the Second World War.

           <br/>
           ii) How does Agent Orange affect the children ?

           iii) Why did they destroy forests and fields ?
