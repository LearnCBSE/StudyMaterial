           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The most important attributes for comparing countries are:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The income of the countries is considered to be one of the most important attributes for their comparison.
           </li>
           <li>
            Generally, countries which have higher income are considered more developed than the countries which have less income.
           </li>
           <li>
            This is based on the understanding that more income provides more of all things that human beings need. People will be able to get whatever they required and want with greater income. That’s why greater income itself is considered to be one important goal.

Emergency of Human Development Report: When it is realised that the level of income alone is not able to reflect the true picture of the development of a country, other parameters on which development could be measured begin to develop. A long list such criteria was thought but only small number of the most important things were selected which included health and education indicators. Over the past decade or so, health and education indicators have come to be widely used along with income as a measure of development. Human Development Report uses these indicators.

           Question 27.
           <br/>
           What is community government? Explain the concept of community government with context to Belgium. (1.5= 1.5)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A community government is one in which different social groups are given the power to handle the affairs related to their communities. They are expected to work jointly for the benefit of the common masses without undermining any community.
           <br/>
           In Belgium, there is a community government This community government is elected by people belonging to one language community, viz, Dutch. French and German speaking, no matter where they live. This government has the power regarding cultural, educational, and language-related issues.

           Question 28.
           <br/>
           Discuss the various efforts made at the international level for the conservation of natural resources.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Efforts made at international level for the conservation of natural resources are as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The first effort at the international level was made in 1968 with the Club of Rome which promoted resource conservation more systematically. Then, in 1974, Schumacher in his book ‘Small is Beautiful’ argued about resource conservation in Gandhian philosophy.
           </li>
           <li>
            The Brundtland Commission Report, 1987 made an influential contribution in resource conservation at the global level. The concept of ‘Sustainable Development’ was introduced by this report and promoted as a way for resource conservation. After that, it was published in a book entitled ‘Our Common Future’.
           </li>
           <li>
            The Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992 was another major contribution concerning resource conservation.

           <br/>
           What is the importance of the opposition party in a democracy? (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The opposition party plays a very important role in a democracy in the following ways
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            It acts as a pressure group.
           </li>

           Question 30.
           <br/>
           Why was there a conflict between the Sinhala and Tamils?
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Discuss the arrangements made under the Constitution of Belgium to solve the problem of community conflict.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) After emerging of Sri Lanka as an independent country in 1948, the leaders of the Sinhala community looked to secure dominance over government because of their majority. Soon, a series of majoritarian measures were adopted by the democratically elected government to establish the supremacy of Sinhala.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) With an Act passed by the Sri Lankan Parliament in 1956, Sinhala was recognised as the only official language ignoring Tamil. Also, the preferential policies followed by the Sri Lankan government used to favour Sinhala applicants for university positions and government jobs.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Protecting and promoting Buddhism was made the duty of state by the new constitution. As government had adopted these measures step by step, the feeling of alienation among the Sri Lankan Tamils increased.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) Tamils were begun to believe that all the major political parties led by the Buddhist Sinhala leaders were not sensitive to their language and culture.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) They felt that the constitution and government policies were not giving them equal political rights, discriminated against them in getting jobs and other opportunities and ignored their interests. Due to these, the relations between the Sinhala and Tamil communities spoiled over time.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Following were the arrangements made under the constitution of Belgium to solve the problem of community conflict.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            According to the Constitution, Central government shall have the equal numbers of Dutch and French-speaking ministers.
           </li>
           <li>
            Some special laws can only be passed with the support of majority of members from each linguistic group. These provisions ensure that no single community can make decisions unilaterally.
           </li>
           <li>
            Many powers of the central government have been given to state governments of the two regions of the country. The state governments are not subordinate to the central government.
           </li>
           <li>
            There is a separate government in Brussels in which both the communities have equal representation. Despite being majority community in Brussels, the French-speaking people accepted equal representation in government because the Dutch-speaking community has accepted equal representation in the central government despite being majority community all over the country.
           </li>
           <li>
            Besides the Central and the State governments, there is a third kind of government also i.e., Community government. It is elected by people belonging to one language viz., Dutch, French, and German-speaking community irrespective of their living area. Community governments have the power regarding cultural, educational and language-related issues.

           Question 31.
           <br/>
           Define the term democracy. What outcomes are expected from a democracy? (1+4)
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Evidence shows that in practice, many democracies did not fulfill the expectations of producing economic development in the
           <br/>
           country. Validate the statement with the help of relevant examples. (5)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Democracy is a form of government that allows people to choose their own representatives. People have the freedom to express their opinion and organise protests.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The outcomes expected from a democracy are
           </li>
           <li>
            People should get a chance to choose their representatives without any fear.
           </li>
           <li>
            Free and fair elections should be conducted by an independent machinery.
           </li>
           <li>
            Elections must be held periodically based on Universal Adult Franchise,
           </li>
           <li>
            The elected representatives should be accountable to the people.
           </li>
           <li>
            Freedom of press should be allowed.
           </li>
           <li>
            People should be vigilant and participate actively in the process of governance.
           </li>
           <li>
            There should be a strong opposition which should act as a watchdog on government both inside and outside the Parliament.
           </li>
           <li>
            It must provide methods to resolve conflicts in the society.
           </li>
           <li>
            It must promote equality among the citizens.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Or
           <br/>
           Evidence shows that in practice, many democracies did not fulfill the expectations of producing economic development in the country. If we consider all democracies and all dictatorships for the fifty years between 1950 and 2000, dictatorships have slightly higher rate of economic growth.
          </p>
          <p>
           Economic development depends on several factors. These factors are the country’s population size, global situation, cooperation from other countries, economic priorities adopted by the country, etc. However, the difference in the rates of economic development between less developed countries with dictatorships and democracies is negligible. Overall, it cannot be said that democracy is a guarantee of economic development. But we can expect democracy not to lag behind dictatorships in this respect.
          </p>
          <p>
           With such a significant difference in the rates of economic growth between countries under dictatorship and democracy, it is better to prefer democracy as it has several other positive outcomes. For example, North Korea has a higher rate of economic growth than India.

           Question 32.
           <br/>
           Name the two most important cereal crops grown in India. Describe the conditions required to grow these two crops.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           “The Government of India has introduced various institutional and technological reforms to improve agriculture in the 1980s and 1990s.” Support this statement with examples.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Rice and wheat are the two most important cereal crops grown in India.
           <br/>
           Rice is the staple food crop of most people in India especially in coastal regions.
          </p>
          <p>
           The geographical conditions required for growth of rice are as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            It is a kharif crop and requires hot and humid climate for cultivation. Temperature above 25°C and high humidity with annual rainfall above loo cm is favourable for growth of rice.
           </li>
           <li>
            Rich alluvial soils of the flood plains, river basins and deltaic areas which are renewed every year are ideal for rice cultivation.
           </li>
           <li>
            Rice requires abundant rainfall or good water supply through irrigation and flooded fields during the earlier part of its growing season in June-July. Ankle-deep water in the field helps the crops grow.
           </li>
           <li>
            Plenty of cheap labour is required as most of the farming involves manual labour. Wheat is the main food crop for the people residing in the North and North-western part of the country.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           The geographical conditions favourable for growth of wheat are as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Wheat is a rabi crop and requires a cool growing season. Average temperature should be between 10°C to 15°C at the time of sowing, but higher temperatures and bright sunshine is required at the time of harvesting for proper ripening of grains.
           </li>
           <li>
            Wheat requires moderate rainfall of 50 cm to 75 cm annually, evenly distributed over the growing season. A little winter rain before ripening helps in increasing the yield.
           </li>
           <li>
            Deep alluvial clayey soils of Northern Plains and black soil of Deccan are suitable for growing wheat. There are two important wheat-growing zones in the country: the Ganga-Sutlej plains in the northwest and the black soil region of the Deccan. Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, and Rajasthan are the major wheat-growing states.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           OR
           <br/>
           The Government of India has introduced various institutional and technological reforms under comprehensive Land Development Programme to improve agriculture in the 1980s and 1990s.
          </p>
          <p>
           Land Development Programme:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Provision for crop insurance against drought, flood, cyclone, fire and disease.
           </li>
           <li>
            Establishment of Grameen (regional rural) banks, cooperative societies, and banks for providing loan facilities to the farmers at lower rates of interest.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Other Reforms:
           <br/>
           Apart from land development programme, government has initiated many other benefit schemes for the farmers.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme for giving easy and cheap loans to small farmers. Personal Accident Insurance Scheme (PAIS) for Kisan Credit Card (KCC) holders.
           </li>
           <li>
            Special weather bulletins and agricultural programmes for farmers were introduced through radio and television channels.
           </li>
           <li>
            Government also announced Minimum Support Price (MSP) for various agricultural products like cereals, pulses and others to check the exploitation of farmers by middlemen.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Question 33.
           <br/>
           Explain how did the ideas of national unity in early 19th-century Europe allied to the ideology of Liberalism. Explain. (5)
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           How did the revolutionaries spread their ideas in many European states after 1815. Explain briefly with the support of examples. (5)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The ideas of national unity in early 19th century Europe allied to the ideology of liberalism in the following ways
           <br/>
           For the liberal middle classes, the ideas of national unity means the abolition of aristocratic privileges Liberalism stood for freedom for the individual and equality of all before the law
          </p>
          <p>
           Liberalism emphasised the concept of government It urges for a Constitution and representative government through Parliament, National unity can be maintained by the proper governance of the Parliament.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the economic sphere, liberalism is in favour of the freedom of markets and the abolition of state-imposed restrictions on the movement of goods and capital. During the 19th century, this was a strong demand of the middle class which was in favour of national unity.
          </p>
          <p>
           Or
           <br/>
           After 1815, due to the fear of repression, many revolutionaries or liberal nationalists hide to avoid arrest. They spread their ideas in the following ways
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            They established many secret societies to train revolutionaries and spread their ideas.
           </li>
           <li>
            They opposed monarchical forms of government that were established after the Vienna Congress.
           </li>
           <li>
            They fought for liberty and freedom and thought the creation of a nation-state as a necessary part of their struggle for freedom,
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Giuseppe Mazzini founded secret societies like Young Italy and Young Europe for the unification of fragmented Italy
           <br/>
           Following Mazzini’s model, secret societies were set up in Germany, France, Switzerland, and Poland.
          </p>
          <p>
           Liberalism and nationalism brought revolution in many regions of Europe like the provinces of the Ottoman Empire. Ireland. Poland besides Italy and Germany.

           Question 34.
           <br/>
           Read the source given below and answer the questions that follows:
           <br/>
           The Portuguese and Spanish conquest and colonisation of America was decisively underway by the mid-sixteenth century. European conquest was not just a result of superior firepower. In fact, the most powerful weapon of the Spanish conquerors was not a conventional military weapon at all. It was the germs such as those of smallpox that they carried on their person. Because of their long isolation, America’s original inhabitants had no immunity against these diseases that came from Europe. Smallpox in particular proved a deadly killer. Once introduced, it spread deep into the continent, ahead even of any Europeans reaching there. It killed and decimated whole communities, paving the way for conquest.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 34.1
           <br/>
           Which two nations were the earliest colonisers in America?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Portugal and Spain were the earliest nations that colonised America around mid-sixteenth century.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 34.2
           <br/>
           What were some of the reasons due to which the colonisers easily established their control over several parts of America?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The colonisers had superior firepower, military weapons, and many advanced materials. But their most important weapon proved to be smallpox.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 34.3
           <br/>
           How smallpox turned into death of native people of America?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Spanish conquerors transmitted the disease of smallpox to a large number of the native people in America which spread rapidly in the continent. The native people did not have immunity towards this disease and due to which there was death of thousands of people because of this disease. It led to the eradication of number of communities and made the colonisation easier.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 35.
           <br/>
           Read the given extract and answer the following questions.
           <br/>
           Another way of classifying economic activities into sectors could be based on who owns assets and is responsible for the
           <br/>
           delivery of services. In the public sector, the government owns most of the assets and provides all the services. In the private
           <br/>
           sector, ownership of assets and delivery of services is in the hands of private individuals or companies.
          </p>
          <p>
           Railways or post office is an example of the public sector whereas companies like Tata Iron and Steel Company Limited (TISCO) or Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) are privately owned. Activities in the private sector are guided by the motive to earn profits. To get such services we have to pay money to these individuals and companies.
          </p>
          <p>
           The purpose of the public sector is not just to earn profits. Governments raise money through taxes and other ways to meet expenses on the services rendered by it.
          </p>

           Question 36.
           <br/>
           Read the given extract and answer the following questions.
           <br/>
           Political parties are easily one of the most visible institutions in a democracy. For most ordinary citizens, democracy is equal to political parties. If you travel to remote parts of our country and speak to the less educated citizens, you could come across people who may not know anything about our Constitution or about the nature of our government. But chances are that they would know something about our political parties. At the same time, this visibility does not mean popularity. Most people tend to be very critical of political parties. They tend to blame parties for all that is wrong with our democracy and our political life. Parties have become identified with social and political divisions.
