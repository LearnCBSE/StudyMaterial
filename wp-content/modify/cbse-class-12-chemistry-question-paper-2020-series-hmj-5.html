           The halogens have the smallest atomic radii in their respective periods. The atomic radius of fluorine is extremely small. All halogens exhibit -1 oxidation state. They are strong oxidising agents and have maximum negative electron gain enthalpy. Among halogens, fluorine shows anomalous behaviour in many properties. For example, electro negativity and ionization enthalpy are higher for fluorine than expected whereas bond dissociation enthalpy, m.p and b.p. and electron gain enthalpy are quite lower than expected. Halogens react with hydrogen to give hydrogen halides (HX) and combine amongst themselves to form a number of compounds of the type XX’, XX’

            3
           </sub>
           , XX’
           <sub>

           </sub>
           and XX’7 called inter-halogens.

           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Why halogens have maximum negative electron gain enthalpy?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Because of their high electronegativity they have strong tendency to accept electrons which is due to their small size and high effective nuclear charge in their corresponding periods.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Why fluorine shows anomalous behaviour as compared to other halogens?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Fluorine shows anomalous behaviour because of its small size, interelectronic repulsions and absence of d-orbitals in valency shell.

           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Arrange the hydrogen halides (HF to HI) in the decreasing order of their reducing character.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           HI &gt; HBr &gt; HCl &gt; HF
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Why fluorine is a stronger oxidizing agent than chlorine?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Because of its low bond dissociation enthalpy and highest eletronegativity it can accept electron pair easily and undergoes reduction.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           What are the sizes of X and X’ in the interhalogen compounds?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           X is bigger in size than that of X’ in the interhalogen compounds.

           Question 23.
           <br/>
           Define adsorption with an example. What is the role of adsorption in heterogeneous catalysis? [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Adsorption is defined as the deposition of molecular species onto the surface of adsorbent.
           <br/>
           Example: Adsorption of methylene blue dye on animal charcoal.
          </p>
          <p>
           In heterogeneous catalysis, gaseous or liquid reactants are adsorbed on the surface of solid catalyst by physisorption or chemisorption, due to which, the concentration of the reactant molecules increases on the surface and also the rate of reaction.

           Define Brownian movement. What is the cause of Brownian movement in colloidal particles? How is it responsible for the stability of Colloidal Sol?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Brownian movement is the zig-zag or random motion of the colloidal particles. It is due to the collision of these particles by the molecules of dispersion medium with different forces from different directions.
           <br/>
           During Brownian motion, a stirring effect is produced which does not allow the sol particles to settle down. Hence, it affects the stability of the colloidal sol.

           (b) An ambidentate ligand possesses two donor sites but can ligate using one donor site at a time. For example, CN can ligate through either ‘C’ or ‘N’ atom of it.
           <br/>
           A chelating ligand has multiple donor sites and can ligate using atleast two donor sites at a time and can form cyclic complexes. For example, ethylene diamine, EDTA, etc.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Given: I = 2 A
           <br/>
           Weight of Cu deposited at cathode of cell B = 2 g
           <br/>
           n = 2
           <br/>
           So, Weight of Cu deposited, W \(=\frac{\text { Atomic mass } \times \mathrm{I} \times t}{n \mathrm{~F}}\)
           <br/>
           2 = \(\frac{63.5 \times 2 \times t}{2 \times 96,500}\) ∴ t = \(\frac{2 \times 96,500 \times 2}{63.5 \times 2}\)
           <br/>
           ∴ t = \(\frac{3,86,000}{127}\) = 3039 seconds
           <br/>
           Now, weight of zinc deposited, W = \(\frac{\mathrm{ZI} t}{n \mathrm{~F}}\)
           <br/>
           = \(\frac{65.0 \times 2 \times 3,039}{2 \times 96,500}\) = 2.05 g

           Question 33.
           <br/>
           Give reasons:
           <br/>
           (i) Aniline does not undergo Friedal-Crafts reaction.
           <br/>
           (ii) Aromatic primary amines cannot be prepared by Gabriel’s phthalimide synthesis.
           <br/>
           (iii) Aliphatic amines are stronger bases than ammonia. [3 × 1 = 3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i)
           <br/>
           Aniline being a Lewis base reacts with Lewis acid AlCl
           <sub>
            3
           </sub>
           to form a salt.
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Class 12 Chemistry Question Paper 2020 (Series HMJ5) with Solutions 52" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-167628" height="55" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CBSE-Class-12-Chemistry-Question-Paper-2020-Series-HMJ5-with-Solutions-52.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CBSE-Class-12-Chemistry-Question-Paper-2020-Series-HMJ5-with-Solutions-52.png 518w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CBSE-Class-12-Chemistry-Question-Paper-2020-Series-HMJ5-with-Solutions-52-300x32.png 300w" width="518"/>
           <br/>
           As a result, N of aniline acquires positive charge and hence it acts as a strong deactivating group for electrophilic substitution reaction. Consequently, aniline does not undergo Freidel Craft reaction.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Aromatic primary amines cannot be prepared by Gabriel’s phthalimide synthesis as aryl halides do not undergo nucleophilic substitution reaction with the potassium salt formed by reaction between phthalimide and ethanolic potassium hydroxide.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Aliphatic amines are stronger bases than ammonia due to +I (electron releasing effect) effect of the alkyl groups leading to high electron density on the nitrogen atom. Hence, lone pair of electrons can be easily donated.

          </p>
          <p>
           Define the following terms: [1 + 1 + 1 = 3]
           <br/>
           (i) Protective colloid
           <br/>
           (ii) Zeta potential
           <br/>
           (iii) Emulsifying agent
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Protective colloid. They are lyophillic colloids such as gums, soaps, gelatine etc., that when added to lyophobic colloids, protect them to get precipitated by coagulating action of electrolytes.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Zeta potential. When one type of the ions of the electrolyte are adsorbed on the surface of colloidal particles it forms a fixed layer which attracts another layer of opposite ions thus forming a Helmholtz electrical double layer whose potential difference between the two layers is termed as Zeta potential.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Emulsifying agent. The substances which are added in added quantities to stabilize the emulsions hence prevent them from separating are called emulsifying agents, for example: soaps, proteins, agar etc.

           </sub>
           [3 + 2 = 5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) (i) The catalytic properties of the transition elements are due to the presence of unpaired electrons in their incomplete d-orbitals and variable oxidation states.
           <br/>
           (ii) Separation of a mixture of Lanthanoid elements is difficult because of similarities in their physical and chemical properties due to Lanthanoid contraction.
           <br/>
           (iii) Zn, Cd and Hg are soft and have low melting point because of absence of any unpaired electrons in their d-orbitals and very weak metallic bonding.

           Question 37.
           <br/>
           (a) A first order reaction is 25% complete in 40 minutes. Calculate the value of rate constant. In what time will the reaction be 80% completed?
           <br/>
           (b) Define order of reaction. Write the condition under which a bimolecular reaction follows first order kinetics. [3 + 2 = 5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) For the first order reaction, K = \(\frac{2.303}{t}\) log \(\frac{a}{a-0.25 a}\)
           <br/>
           When reaction is 25% complete:
           <br/>
           Given. X = \(\frac{25 a}{100}\) = 0.25a; t = 40 min.
           <br/>
           K = \(\frac{2.303}{40}\) log \(\frac{a}{a-0.25 a}\) ⇒ K = \(\frac{2.303}{40}\) log \(\frac{a}{0.75 a}\)
           <br/>
           K = 0.057575 (log 100 – log 75)
           <br/>
           K = 0.057575 (2 – 1.87506) = 0.057575 × 0.12494 = 0.007193 min
           <sup>
            -1
           </sup>
           <br/>
           ∴ Value of rate constant (K) = 0.007193 min
           <sup>
            -1
           </sup>
           <br/>
           When reaction is 80% complete
           <br/>
           ∴ x = 0.8a, t = ?
           <br/>
           K = 0.007193 min
           <sup>
            -1
           </sup>
           <br/>
           ∴ t = \(\frac{2.303}{\mathrm{~K}}\) log \(\frac{a}{a-x}\) = \(\frac{2.303}{0.007193}\) log \(\frac{a}{a-0.8 a}\)
           <br/>
           = 320.1723 log \(\frac{a}{0.2 a}\) = 320.1723 (log 10 – log 2)
           <br/>
           = 320.1723(1 – 0.3010) = 320.1723 × 0.699 = 223.80 min.
           <br/>
           ∴ Time required for 80°Á completion is 223.80 minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) The sum of powers to which the molar concentration in the rate law equation are raised to express the observed rate of the reaction is called the order of reaction.
           <br/>
           A bimolecular reaction may become kinetically of first order if one of the reactants is present in large excess.

           (b) Two conditions for collisions to be.effective are:
           <br/>
           (i) The colliding molecules must have energy greater than the threshold energy.
           <br/>
           (ii) The colliding molecules must have proper orientation at the Ulme of collision.

           Question 26.
           <br/>
           Discuss the nature of bonding in metal carbonyls. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The metal-carbon bonds in metal carbonvis have both a and it characters. A weak σ bond is formed by donation of e
           <sup>
            –
           </sup>
           pair from irhon to metal (M ← C ≡ 0) and a stronger π bond is formed by back donation of electrons from filled d-orbital of metal into empty antibonding π* orbital of carbon (πM → C bond). The total bonding is thus M = C = O and bond order of C—O bond is reduced from triple bond to double bond. This is synergic effect.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Polysaccha rides. They give a large number of molecules long chains of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic linkage on hydrolysis. For example, starch, cellulose, etc.
           <br/>
           (ii) Denatured protein. The protein which has lost its biological activity due to cleavage of hydrogen bonds and unfolding of protein molecular through change in temperature, pH and coagulation is called denatured protein. For example, coagulation of white of an egg on boiling.
           <br/>
           (iii) Fibrous protein. These are linear thread-like molecules which tend to lie side by side to form fibres and their polypeptide chains are held together by hydrogen and disuiphide bonds. For example, Keratin in skin, hair, etc.

           Question 31.
           <br/>
           (i) What are the hydrolysis products of DNA?
           <br/>
           (ii) What happens when D-glucose is treated with Bromine water?
           <br/>
           (iii) What is the effect of denaturation on the structure of proteins? 1+1+1=3
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Hydrolysis products of DNA are a pentose sugar, i.e., 2-deoxy-D-ribose, phosphoric acid and nitrogenous bases like Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine and Thymine.
           <br/>
           (ii) When D-glocose is treated with bromine water D-gluconic acid is formed.

          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Due to denaturation, the secondary and tertiary structures of protein are destroyed as their globules get unfolded and helixes get uncoiled and thus enzyme loses its activity. However, primary structure of protein remains unaffected.
