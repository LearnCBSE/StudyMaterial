           Question 41.
           <br/>
           How do viruses differ from other micro-organisms such as bacteria?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Viruses differ from other micro-organisms because they are too much smaller in comparison to other micro-organisms. They do not show most of the characteristics of the living organisms like respiration. They just reproduce. They, however, reproduce only inside the cells of the host organism, which may be a bacterium, plant or animal. Hence, viruses differ from other micro-organisms.

           How do mosquitoes carry disease-causing micro-organisms and spread diseases?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Mosquito acts a carrier of disease causing micro-organism and spreads diseases from one person to another. They carry disease-causing micro-organisms (microbes) inside its body. Female Anopheles mosquito is a carrier of malarial parasite. When it bits a person suffering from malaria, it sucks the blood of that person which contains the malarial parasite microbes. When this infected mosquito bites a healthy person, it transfers the microbes into his blood stream, hence the healthy person also gets malarial disease.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Medicines which kill or stop the growth of the disease-causing micro-organisms are called antibiotics. Streptomycin, tetracycline and erythromycin are some of the commonly known antibiotics which are made from fungi and bacteria.
          </p>
          <p>
           Some of the precautions should be taken while taking antibiotics which are as follows:
          </p>

           <br/>
           Describe how, curd is made from milk. Name the bacterium which converts milk into curd:
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Milk is turned into curd by bacteria. Milk contains many microorganisms. Of these, the bacterium Lactobacillus promotes the formation of curd.
          </p>
          <p>
           When a small amount of pre-made curd is added into warm milk, then lactobacillus bacterium present in curd multiplies in milk and converts it into curd. During this process, lactobacillus bacterium acts on lactose sugar present in milk and converts it into lactic acid. This lactic acid then converts milk into curd.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Yeast is used in baking industry for making bread. It increase the volume of dough. When yeast is mixed in dough for making bread, the yeast reproduces rapidly and produces carbon dioxide during respiration. Bubbles of the gas fill the dough and increase its volume. This makes the dough rise. This is the basis of the use of yeast in the baking industry for making breads, pastries and cakes.

           <li>
            Spray insecticides and control breeding of mosquitoes by not allowing water to collect in the surroundings.
           </li>
           <li>
            Keep the infected person separated from others &amp; advice him/ her to keep a handkerchief on the nose and mouth while sneezing.
           </li>
           <li>

           Question 68 A.
           <br/>
           What is a vaccine? How does a vaccine work?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A vaccine is a special kind of preparation which provides immunity against a particular disease. Vaccine consists dead and weakened microbes which are harmless and do not cause any disease. Vaccine works as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            When the vaccine containing dead or weakened microbes is introduced into the body of a healthy person, the body fights and kills the microbes by producing some substance called antibodies.
           </li>
           <li>
            Some of the antibodies remain in the body for a long time and protect it from any future attack of disease germs. Thus, a vaccine develops the immunity from a disease.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Question 68 B.
           <br/>
           Why are children given vaccination ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Vaccination is the process of giving a vaccine orally or by injection which gives protection against a particular disease. Vaccination protect the children from number of diseases. Several diseases, including cholera, tuberculosis, smallpox and hepatitis can be prevented by vaccination.
          </p>
          <p>
           Since the immune system of children is not strong and they are more likely to catch any disease very easily, so all the children should be vaccinated at the proper ages to provide them immunity from certain diseases.

           Question 69.
           <br/>
           What is meant by ‘nitrogen fixation’ ? State two ways in which nitrogen gas of the atmosphere can be ‘fixed’ in nature to get nitrogen compounds in the soil.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The process of converting atmospheric nitrogen into compounds of nitrogen is called nitrogen fixation. The two ways in which in which nitrogen gas of the atmosphere can be ‘fixed’ in nature to get nitrogen compounds in the soil are:
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) Nitrogen fixation by lightning: Lightning also helps in fixing atmospheric nitrogen into the soil. The temperature and pressure during lightning convert atmospheric nitrogen into oxides of nitrogen. These nitrogen compounds combine with rainwater to form nitric and nitrous acid which mix with the soil.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Nitrogen fixation by certain bacteria and blue-green algae: Certain bacteria and blue-green algae present in the soil fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert it into compounds of nitrogen.
