           <br/>
           <strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           Decentralisation refers to the systematic effort to delegate to the lowest level, all authority except which can be exercised at the central point.
           <br/>
           The following factors highlight its importance: (Any Four)
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (i) Greatern motivation
           </strong>
           Decentralisation improves the morale and motivation of subordinates which is reflected in better work performance.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (ii) Develops initiative among subordinates
           </strong>
           Decentralisation helps to promote self-reliance and confidence amongst the subordinates. This is because when lower managerial levels are given freedom to take their own decisions, they learn to depend on their own judgement. It helps to promote initiative and creativity among them.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (iii) Develops managerial talent for the future
           </strong>
           As a result of decentralisation, employees get more opportunities to develop new skills. It makes them better future managers.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (iv) Quick decision-making
           </strong>
           Decentralisation in an organisation, provides more freedom to lower level managers to take their own decisions. There is no need to get approval from higher level. It helps in quick and better decision-making.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (v) Facilitates growth and expansion
           </strong>
           Decentralisation facilitates organisational growth through expansion and diversification. Top executives are not burdened by the administrative problems and complexities. So, they are able to plan expansion and diversification.

           <strong>
            4. Explain by giving any three reasons why delegation is important in an
           </strong>
           <strong>
            organisation.(Delhi 2010)
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           Delegation is important because:
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (i) Business growth
           </strong>
           It helps in the expansion of an organisation by providing a ready workforce to take up leading positions in new ventures.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (ii) Healthy relations
           </strong>
           It establishes healthy superior subordinate relationships which are the basis of hierarchy of management.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (iii) Tool of training
           </strong>
           It allows the subordinates to take decision independently. Thus, it is a tool for developing managers for the future.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            5. Delegation is a key element in effective organising. Explain with the help of any
           </strong>
           <strong>
            four reasons.  (Delhi 2009c)
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           ‘Delegation means the granting of authority to subordinates to operate within the prescribed limits/    (1)
           <br/>
           Effective delegation leads to the following benefits:
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (i) Effective management
           </strong>
           By empowering the employees, the managers are able to function more efficiently as they get more time to concentrate on important matters.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (ii) Employee development
           </strong>
           As a result of delegation, employees get more opportunities to utilise their talent. It also allows them to develop those skills which will enable them to perform complex tasks and assume those responsibilities which will improve their career prospects.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (iii) Facilitating growth
           </strong>
           Delegation helps in the expansion of an organisation by providing a ready work force to take up leading positions in new ventures.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (iv) Basis of management hierarchy
           </strong>
           Delegation of authority establishes healthy superior-subordinate relationships, which are the basis of hierarchy of management. It is the degree and flow of authority which determines ‘who is reports to whom’.

            Ans.

           In the light of given statement, we can say that decentralisation results in the multiplication of authority by many because of the following points of its importance:
           <br/>
           Decentralisation refers to the systematic effort to delegate to the lowest level, all authority except which can be exercised at the central point.

           An organisational structure cannot be concieved without authority and responsibility. These are two important elements in delegation of authority.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Authority
           </strong>
           It refers to the right of an individual to command his subordinates and to take action within the scope of his position. According to Henri Fayol, ‘Authority is the right to give orders and the power to exact obedience. Authority gives holder the power to enforce orders or decisions. It can be delegated. It always flows downwards i.e. vertically from superiors to subordinates’.
           <strong>
            Responsibility
           </strong>
           It is the obligation of a subordinate to properly perform the assigned duties. It arises from a superior-subordinate relationship. According to Davis Filley, ‘Responsibility is the obligation of the individual to perform assigned duties to the best of his abilities under the direction of his executive’.

           Delegation is a key element in effective organising. The delegation of authority is essential for the existence of an organisation. It helps in the efficient functioning of the organisation. According to Theo Haimann, ‘Delegation of authority merely means the granting of authority to subordinates to operate within the prescribed limits’. Delegation ensures that the subordinates perform tasks on- behalf of manager thereby, reducing his work load.

           </strong>
           Delegation is a key element in effective organising. The delegation of authority is essential for the existence of an organisation. It helps in the efficient functioning of the organisation. The following points highlight the importance of delegation of authority are:
           <br/>
           ‘Delegation means the granting of authority to subordinates to operate within the prescribed limits/
           <br/>
           Effective delegation leads to the following benefits:
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (i) Effective management
           </strong>
           By empowering the employees, the managers are able to function more efficiently as they get more time to concentrate on important matters.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (ii) Employee development
           </strong>
           As a result of delegation, employees get more opportunities to utilise their talent. It also allows them to develop those skills which will enable them to perform complex tasks and assume those responsibilities which will improve their career prospects.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (iii) Facilitating growth
           </strong>
           Delegation helps in the expansion of an organisation by providing a ready work force to take up leading positions in new ventures.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (iv) Basis of management hierarchy
           </strong>
           Delegation of authority establishes healthy superior-subordinate relationships, which are the basis of hierarchy of management. It is the degree and flow of authority which determines ‘who is reports to whom’.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (v) Reduces the burden of superior executive
           </strong>
           The delegation of authority means sharing of work and authority with others. A manager can assign a part of his responsibility and grant authority to his subordinates. This reduces his work load and helps superiors in concentrating on the work which is more important.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (vi) Motivation
           </strong>
           It gives job satisfaction to subordinates. It motivates them to render their willing cooperation for achieving the organisational goals. It leads them to higher performance and makes them more responsible.
