           The areas or regions located outside the jurisdiction of any one state and region, common governance by international community are Global Commons i.e. Earth atmosphere, Antarctic Ocean floor and outer space. They are exploited and polluted due to
           <br/>
           1. Vague scientific evidences, their lack of consensus on common environmental issues.
           <br/>
           2. North-South inequalities and their exploitative activities and competition lack proper management area out space.
           <br/>
           3. Technological and Industrial development have also affected the earth’s atmosphere and ocean floor.

             6. What is meant by ‘Common but differentiated responsibilities’? How could we implement the idea?

            <strong>
             Answer.
            </strong>
           </span>
           Common but differentiated responsibili¬ties mean that the state shall cooperate in the spirit of global partnership to conserve, protect and restore the health and integrity of the earth’s ecosystem. As the states have common but differ¬entiated responsibilities over various contributions of global environmental degradation. The developed countries acknowledge that the responsibility that they bear in the international pursuit of sustainable development in view of the pressures their societies place on the global environment and of the tech-nological and financial resources they command.
           <br/>
           We could implement the idea with the help of conventions and declarations:
           <br/>
           1. The Rio-Summit held in June 1992 produced conventions dealing with climate change, biodiversity, forestry and recommended a list of developed practices called Agenda 21.
           <br/>
           2. The 1992 United Nations Framework convention on climatic change (UNFCCC) also emphasised that the parties should act to protect the climate system on the basis of common but differentiated responsibilities;
           <br/>
           3. An international agreement known Kyoto Protocol set targets for industrialised countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions which support for global warming.

             7. Why have issues related to global environmental protection become the priority concern of states since the 1990s?

             Answer.
            </strong>
           </span>
           Issues related to global environmental protection became the priority concern of states since the 1990s because at global level, the environmental issues drew attentions of various states at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio-de-Janerio, Brazil in June 1992 through Agenda 21:
           <br/>
           1. Rio-Summit 1992 dealt with climatic change, bio-diversity and forestry.
           <br/>
           2. Agenda 21 combined economic growth with ecological responsibilities.
           <br/>
           3. Kyoto Protocol set targets for greenhouse emissions. The above mentioned conferences and summits raised the environmental issues at the global level to take steps by various states to check environmental degradation in a co-operative manner.

             Answer.
            </strong>
           </span>
           Compromise and accommodation are the two essential policies to save Planet Earth by the states but the states from North and South have different notions towards environmental issues:
           <br/>
           1. The Northern States (Developed) are concerned with ozone depletion and global warming whereas southern states (Developing) want to address the relationship between economic development and environmental management.
           <br/>
           2. The developed countries of the North want to discuss the environmental issues which stand equally responsible for ecological conservation.
           <br/>
           3. The developing countries of the south feel that much of the ecological degradation in the world is created by developed countries through their industrial projects.
           <br/>
           4. And if developed countries cause more environmental degradation they are supposed to take more responsibility onwards.
           <br/>
           5. The developing counties are under process of industrialization and they should be exempted from restrictions imposed on developed countries through various conventions like protocol etc.
           <br/>
           6. The special needs of developing coun¬tries must be taken into consider¬ations in the process of development, application and interpretation of rules of International Environmental Law.
           <br/>
           All the above mentioned provisions were accepted in Earth Summit, 1992 while adopting common but differentiated responsibilities.

           </span>
           The economic development can be achieved even without damaging global environment by following practices:
           <br/>
           1. In June 1992, Earth Summit provided some conservative measures for sustainable growth without damaging environment anymore.
           <br/>
           2. The Antarctic Treaty of 1959 covered Global Commons for mutual economic development.
           <br/>
           3. Kyoto protocol cut greenhouse emissions from industrialised countries to protect environment and to develop industries also.

           1. The Northern States (Developed) are concerned with Ozone depletion and global warming whereas Southern States (Developing) warn to address the relationship between economic development and environmental management.
           <br/>
           2. The developed countries of the North want to discuss the environmental issues which stands equally responsible for ecological conservation.
           <br/>
           3. The developing countries of the South feel that much of the ecological degradation in the world is created by developed countries through their industrial projects.
           <br/>
           4. And if developed countries cause more environmental degradation they are supposed to take more responsibility onwards.
           <br/>
           5. The developing countries are under process of industrialization and they should be exempted from restrictions imposed on developed countries through various conventions like Kyoto Protocol etc.

           India plays a dominating role among the Asian countries on environmental issues:
           <br/>
           1. India signed and ratified the 1997 Kyoto Protocol in August 2002 which emphasised to follow the principle common but differentiated responsibility.
           <br/>
           2. India feels this contravens the very spirit of UNFCCC. Neither does it seem fair to impose restrictions on India when the country’s rise per capita carbon emissions by 2030 is likely to still represent less than half the world average.
           <br/>
           3. The Indian government is also keen to launch a National Mission on Biodiesel which makes India to have one of the largest renewable energy programmes in the world.
           <br/>
           4. The Indian government is also participating in global efforts through a number of programmes i.e. National Auto fuel Policy, Electricity Act 2003, Energy Conservation Act, 2001 etc.

           Environment refers to surroundings of a region which can be improved by taking following steps:
           <br/>
           1. More focus should be on afforestation
           <br/>
           i. e. planting more trees to maintain ecological balance, prevent soil erosion and enhance water cycle also.
           <br/>
           2. Eco-friendly industries should be set up as well as industries adherent should be disposed with scientific methods and industries should be established at far away places from populous/residential areas.

           Environmental movements are the movements of a group which are environmentally conscious to challenge environmental degradation to work at both the national and international levels or local levels:
           <br/>
           1. These movements raise new ideas and long term vision of what we should not do in our individual and collective lines.
           <br/>
           2. These environmental movements may be diverse in nature i.e. the forest movements of the south, in Mexico, Chile, Brazil, Malaysia, Indonesia, continental Africa and India are faced with enormous pressures.
           <br/>
           Categories of Environmental Movements:
           <br/>
           1. Forest Movements
           <br/>
           2. Movement against mining corporation and mineral industry (water pollution)
           <br/>

           </span>
           Oil is the resource which generates immense wealth, hence it creates political struggles involving industrialised countries to adopt various methods to ensure steady flows of oil:
           <br/>
           1. These include deployment of military process near exploitation sites and along sea lanes of communications.
           <br/>
           2. The stockpiling of strategic resources.
           <br/>
           3. They support multinational companies by making favourable international agreements.
           <br/>
           4. The global economy relied on oil as a portable and indispensable fuel, hence, the history of petroleum is the history of war and struggle.
           <br/>
           5. It created conflict between Iraq and Saudi Arabia as Iraq’s known reserves are second only to Saudi Arabia and since substantial portions of Iraqi territory are yet to be fully explored, there is a fair chance that actual reserves might be far larger.

           </span>
           Water is a crucial resource relevant to global politics. Regional variations and increasing scarcity of fresh water in some parts of the world point to the possibility of disagreements over shared water resources as a leading source of conflicts in 21st century, which is known as water wars:
           <br/>
           1. Water wars may create violent conflict due to disagreement of countries over sharing rivers i.e. a typical disagreement is a downstream state’s objection to pollution, excessive irrigation, or construction of dams which degrade the quality of water available to downstream states.
           <br/>
           2. States have used force to seize fresh water resources i.e. 1950, struggle between Israel, Syria and Jordan and 1960s over attempts by each side to divert water from the Jordan and Yarmuk rivers.
           <br/>
           3. The more recent threats between Turkey, Syria and Iraq over the construction of Dams on Euphrates river.

           <strong>
            The global economy relied on oil for much of the 20th century as a portable and indispensable fuel. The immense wealth associated with oil generates political struggles to control it, and the history of petroleum is also the history of war and struggle. Nowhere is this more obviously the case than in West Asia and Central Asia, West Asia, specifically the Gulf region, accounts for about 30 per cent of global oil production. But it has about 64 per cent of the planet’s known reserves, and is therefore the only region able to satisfy any substantial rise in oil demand. Saudi Arabia has a quarter of the world’s total reserves and is the single largest producer. Iraq’s known reserves are second only to Saudi Arabia’s. And, since substantial portions of Iraqi territory are yet to be fully explored, there is a fair chance that actual resei*ves might be far that actual reseiVes might be far larger. The United States, Europe, Japan, and increasingly India and China, which consume this petroleum, are located at a considerable distance from the region.

           </span>
           ‘Commons’ are those resources which are not owned by anyone but rather shared by a community. This could be a ‘common room’, a ‘community centre’, a park or a river. Similarly, there are some areas or regions of the world which are located outside the sovereign jurisdiction of any one state, and therefore require common governance by the international community. These are known as ‘global commons’. They include the earth’s atmosphere, Antarctica, the ocean floor and outer space.
           <br/>
           Although environmental concerns have a long history, awareness of the environmental consequences of economic growth acquired an increasingly political character from the 1960s onwards. The Club of Rome, a global think-tank, published a book in 1972 entitled Limits to Growth, dramatising the potential depletion of the earth’s resources against the backdrop of rapidly growing world population. International agencies began holding international conferences and promoting detailed studies to get a more coordinated and effective response to environmental problems. Since then, the environment has emerged as significant . issue of global politics.
           <br/>
           The growing focus on environmental issues within the arena of global politics was firmly consolidated at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janerio, Brazil, in June, 1992.
           <br/>
           This was also called the Earth Summit. The Summit was attended by 170 states, thousands of NGOs and many multinational corporations. The Summit produced conventions dealing with climate change, biodiversity, forestry and recommended a list of development practices called ‘Agenda 21’. But it left unresolved considerable differences and difficulties. There was a consensus on combining economic growth with ecological responsibility. This approach to development is commonly known as ‘sustainable development’.

           Common but differentiated responsibilities mean that ‘the states shall cooperate in the spirit of global partnership to conserve, protect and restore the health and integrity of the earth’s eco system. As the states have common but differentiated responsibilities over various contribution of global environmental degradation. The developed countries acknowledge that the responsibility that they bear in the international pursuit of sustainable development in view of the pressures their societies place on the global environment and of the technological and financial resources they command. We could implement the idea with the help of conventions and declarations:
           <br/>
           1. The Rio Summit held in June 1992 produced conventions dealing with climate change, biodiversity, forestry and recommended a list of developed practices called Agenda 21.

           2. The 1992 United Nation’s Framework Convention on Climatic Change

           <br/>
           3. An international agreement known by its Protocol set targets for industrialised countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions which support for global warming.

           1. Natural resources are being depleted i.e. cultivable area has not been sustained any more, agricultural land lost fertility and grass lands have been overgrazed.
           <br/>
           2. Waterbodies have suffered a depletion and pollution both.
           <br/>
           3. A steady decline in ozone layer also poses a threat to ecosystem and human health.
           <br/>
           4. Natural forests stabilize the climate, moderate water supply and habitat various species also which are also being lost creating destruction to biodiversity through industrial pollution etc.
           <br/>
           5. Due to land based activities, coastal pollution is also increasing which affects fisheries.

           The UN defines indigenous population as the descendants of people who inhabited the present territory of a country’at the time when persons of a different culture or ethnic origin arrived there from other parts of world and overcome them. The rights of indigenous people can be summarised as follows:
           <br/>
           1. Indigenous people speak of their struggles, agenda and fights like social movements.
           <br/>
           2. Their voices in world politics call for the admission of indigenous people to the world community as equals.
           <br/>
           3. Many of the present day island states in the Oceania region (including Australia, New Zealand) were inhabited by various indigenous people over the course of show for thousands of years.
           <br/>
           4. Indigenous people appeal to government to create indigenous nations with an identity of their own.
           <br/>
           5. The World Council of indigenous people was formed in 1975. The council became the first of 11 indigenous NGOs to receive consultative status in the UN.

           <br/>
           1. It represents ‘Industrial Pollution’ commenting on ‘Global warming’.
           <br/>
           2. Fingers denote pollution coming out of chimneys from industries and the lighter represents burning and depleting of natural resources.
           <br/>
           3. This picture draws the attention of the world towards industrial pollution, if it continues on, flora and fauna will be depleted which will create an imbalance to ecosystem.
