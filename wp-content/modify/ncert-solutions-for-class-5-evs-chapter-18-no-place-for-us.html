           (a) Houses and farms get destroyed.

           Nothing was ideal as Jatrya once dreamt about an ideal village. The houses in Sinduri were made of tin Sheets and were very weak. There was no electricity supply in Sinduri. Jatrya had to bum old tyre as fuel. It was difficult to tolerate the bad stench of burning tyre. There was no open space in Sinduri. There was neither school nor hospital in Sinduri.
           <br/>
           Thus, Sinduri was radically different from Jatrya’s dream village.

           Transfers are an integral part of many jobs. It is always difficult to leave a place and start life afresh in a new place. One has to do lot of packing and unpacking during transfers. One needs to leave close friends from a place and needs to make friends with new people. A child has to move to a new school in a new environment. This is difficult but I think it is challenging also.

           It is totally incorrect to put all the blame on slum dwellers. City people also produce lot of garbage. Many people in middle class colonies throw garbage on the roads. In order to keep their homes clean they throw all the waste on the roads. Slums also develop because of city people. Government constructs new dams, roads, factories, etc. to cater to the needs of city people. As a result displaced people from villages are forced to leave their place and move to cities. These poor people cannot afford good houses and hence they develop slums.

           </span>
           Many people migrate to big cities for different reasons. Life in a big city is difficult and different than it was before.
           <br/>
           It is true that a big city offers many opportunities but there are many more challenges. One has to compromise with limited space in big cities. Poor people are forced to live in unhygienic conditions. They may be earning more than what they earned in villages but they are unable to save money because of the higher cost of living in big cities.
           <br/>
           They also face the problem of language if they are not comfortable with the mainstream language of the city. They are often subject to ridicule because of their distinct culture. They are unable to afford medical facilities and quality education.
