           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the following passage. [12 m]
          </p>
          <p>
           1. The seasonal problem of water taps running dry is plaguing most of our major cities. With the bigger rivers flowing in trickles and ponds, and wells reduced to clay-pits, village women in remote areas have to fetch every drop of water for drinking, cooking, washing and so on, across large distances. This has only worsened a perennial problem, that of widespread pollution of water, rendering it unfit for human consumption. The monsoons and the attendant floods will not solve this problem. The Delhi Administration is seriously worried about the threat to civic health posed by the polluted waters of the Yamuna. More treatment plants are to be set up to treat sewage. The Ganga, the Yamuna, the Kaveri in fact all our important rivers, serving many urban conglomerations are fast becoming a major source of disease.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           2. A comprehensive bill, introduced in Parliament recently, envisages the setting up of Central and State Boards for the prevention and control of water pollution.
          </p>
          <p>
           3. According to a survey of eight dwelling countries conducted a couple of years ago, 90% of all child deaths were due to water borne diseases.
          </p>
          <p>
           4. A new threat that has already assumed alarming proportions is from industrial waste which is generally dumped, untreated, into the nearest river. For instance, for every kilogram of process hide, 30-40 litres of foul smelling, waste water has to be disposed off. There are at least 900 licensed tanneries in the organised sector.
          </p>

          </div>
          <p>
           5. Putrefied paper and jute waste, metallic waste from straw board and textile mills, sulphur, ammonia, urea, metallic salts, corrosive acids – all find their way to the rivers of India.
          </p>
          <p>
           6. It is important not only to make new laws lo ensure the purity of water, but also to realise the urgency of implementing them ruthlessly if we are to avoid a national health disaster cutting across the barrier between towns and the countryside. (311 words)

          <p>
           This is to inform you that we, the students of Class X B, have written this mail to inform you about the lack of furniture in our classroom. Class X B has sixty’students but there are only forty seats in the room. As a result, students either have to sit uncomfortably in the present 40 seats or study while standing. This situation hampers the quality of studies. Thus, we request you to kindly arrange a minimum of 20 seats for the room.
          </p>
          <p>
           Kindly consider and oblidge

           Question 4.
           <br/>
           It is your father/mother’s birthday. Write a factual description of a gift you gave them and with what, why, and how of your choice. Describe the gift and the happiness you and your father/mother felt. The description must not cross the 100-word limit. [4]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           I chose a handcrafted leather journal for my father’s birthday. Its supple, rich brown cover embodies his timeless wisdom and the stories he shares. Inside, smooth cream pages await his thoughts, capturing his reflections as ink dances upon them. I selected this gift because it resonates with his love for writing and encapsulates his profound life journey.
           <br/>
           As he unwrapped the gift, a delighted smile graced his face, mirroring my excitement. Running his fingers over the leather, he remarked on its quality. He shared memories of his younger days when he penned his dreams and aspirations. Now, he’s eager to fill its pages with new adventures and musings, as we bond over shared stories and a shared love for the. written word.

           Sir/Ma’am
          </p>
          <p>
           Through the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I would like to draw the attention of the civic authorities and the general public towards the unhygienic conditions prevailing in our city.
          </p>
          <p>
           We have already experienced an outbreak of Dengue and Chikungunya in the city. Still, the lesson has j not been learned. There is total apathy towards cleanliness. People throw garbage anywhere they see fit. This garbage can be found lying on the roads for days together. Nobody comes to clean it. The drains also have not been cleaned for long and dirty smelling water along with garbage can be seen flowing in it. There are no dustbins to keep the garbage covered, giving rise to mosquito breeding and as a result, mosquito-borne diseases.
          </p>
          <p>
           I request the concerned authorities to take immediate steps to launch a cleanliness drive to remove all the garbage on the roads. The drains should be regularly cleaned. The residents should also get involved in this drive so that we can keep our city clean and not invite outbreaks of any disease.
          </p>
          <p>
           Thanking you

           <br/>
           than 150 words for your school magazine emphasising the importance of travelling. You can use your own

           – Tourism can bridge cultural gaps
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Unlocking the World: The Importance of Travelling — by Aakash X-C
           <br/>
           In a world teeming with technological wonders and vast information at our fingertips, there’s a timeless truth that prevails: “Books give you knowledge, traveling – experience.” As Aakash of Class X-C, I’ve embarked on journeys that have instilled in me the immense importance of exploring beyond the confines of my comfort zone.
           <br/>
           Books indeed are windows to knowledge, yet the true magic lies in experiencing the world first-hand. During a recent trip to the serene mountains, I learned about diverse cultures, tasted local cuisines, and conversed with people whose perspectives enriched my own. Such experiences are imprinted deep within, sparking personal growth beyond what any textbook could offer.
           <br/>
           Moreover, traveling nurtures adaptability, empathy, and open-mindedness. When I ventured to bustling city markets or serene village communities, I learned to navigate unfamiliar terrains and appreciate different ways of life. These encounters imparted a deeper understanding of the world’s intricacies, fostering compassion for people from all walks of life.
           <br/>
           While books are invaluable sources of knowledge, traveling breathes life into that knowledge, making it tangible and unforgettable. So, fellow students, let us embrace the world as our classroom. Let’s journey beyond pages and screens to gain experiences that will mold us into not only knowledgeable individuals but also global citizens ready to shape a brighter future.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) ‘The Two Sides of the Tourism Industry’ – by Jasmeet Kaur X D
           <br/>
           The tourism industry is a double-edged sword, offering both opportunities and challenges to society. Tourism creates job opportunities, stimulates economic growth, and promotes cultural exchange. It allows locals to showcase their heritage, culinary delights, and traditions, fostering a sense of pride and preserving cultural diversity. Mass tourism can strain resources, damage ecosystems, and lead to over-commercialization. It often pushes up the cost of living for residents in popular destinations, making it unaffordable for locals. Responsible tourism emphasizes sustainable practices and respect for local cultures. It’s crucial to be mindful of the impact our travels have on the environment and communities we visit.
           <br/>
           Tourism can bridge cultural gaps, increase global awareness, and promote peace. On the flip side, it can lead to cultural homogenization and create a dependency on tourism income.
           <br/>
           In conclusion, the tourism industry offers immense potential, but it’s our responsibility to ensure it benefits all stakeholders, respects nature and preserves the essence of the places we visit. It’s time to embrace ethical and sustainable tourism for a brighter future.

           Question 8.
           <br/>
           Read the given excerpts and answer the questions briefly, for ANY TWO excerpts, of the three, given.
           <br/>
           (A) Neither stones nor prayers nor sticks.
           <br/>
           Insults or complaints or bricks
           <br/>
           Stilled the frog’s determination
           <br/>
           To display his heart’s elation.
           <br/>
           But one night a nightingale
           <br/>
           In the moonlight cold and pale
           <br/>
           Perched upon the sumac tree
           <br/>
           Casting forth her melody
           <br/>
           Dumbstruck sat the gaping frog
           <br/>
           And the whole admiring bog
           <br/>
           Stared towards the sumac, rapt,
           <br/>
           (The Frog and the Nightingale)
           <br/>
           (i) What is the name of the frog’s vocal training method? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The name of the frog’s vocal training method is not mentioned in the poem. However, it is described as being harsh and demanding, with the frog forcing the nightingale to sing for long hours in bad weather.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) How did the nightingale die? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The nightingale died due to a burst vein caused by the strain of the frog’s training and singing excessively for many hours.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) What did the frog charge the nightingale for his services? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The frog charged the nightingale for his services as her trainer, but the exact amount is not mentioned in the poem. However, it is mentioned that the frog charged admission fees to the audience who came to listen to the nightingale’s singing and earned a lot of money from her performances.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) What did the audiences enjoy in the nightingale’s song? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The audience enjoyed the nightingale’s sweet and melodious voice. They cheered her with words like ‘bravo’, ‘too divine’, and ‘encore’. They were enraptured by her voice and clapped, wept, and cheered in reaction to her singing.
          </p>
          <p>
           (B) And on the pedestal these words appear;
           <br/>
           “My name is Ozymandias, king of kings. Look upon my works, ye mighty and despair!
           <br/>
           Nothing besides remains. Round the decay of that colossal wreck,
           <br/>
           boundless and bare. The lone and level sands stretch far away (Ozymandias)
           <br/>
           (i) The word that best describes the attitude of Ozymandias is ……… [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The word that best describes the attitude of Ozymandias is arrogant. Ozymandias is portrayed as a proud and boastful king who believed in his own greatness and power.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The irony of the pedestal statement is ………… [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The irony of the pedestal statement is that despite Ozymandias’ claim to be the ‘king of kings’ and his command to “look upon my works, ye mighty, and despair,” nothing remains of his works or his kingdom. All that is left is a ruined statue in the middle of a desert, surrounded by nothing but sand.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) The figure of speech used in the line, ‘the lone and level sands stretch far away’ is ……….. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The figure of speech used in the line, ‘the lone and level sands stretch far away’ is alliteration. Alliteration is the repetition of the same sound at the beginning of multiple words in a phrase or sentence.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) The word ‘boundless’ means ………. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The word ‘boundless’ means unlimited or vast. In this context, it refers to the vast expanse of sand surrounding the ruined statue of Ozymandias.

           (C) CAESAR: Cowards die many times before their death;
           <br/>
           The valiant never taste of death but once.
           <br/>
           Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.
           <br/>
           It seems to me most strange that men should fear;
           <br/>
           Seeing that death, a necessary end,
           <br/>
           Will come when it will come
           <br/>
           (Julius Caesar)
           <br/>
           (i) Whom does Caesar console and why? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Caesar is consoling himself in this passage. He is trying to calm his fears about the possibility of death by reminding himself that death is a necessary end that will come when it is meant to come.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Which quality of the speaker is revealed here? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The quality of the speaker that is revealed here is bravery. Caesar is portrayed as a brave and valiant man who does not fear death.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Explain: Cowards die many times before their deaths. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The phrase “Cowards die many times before their deaths” means that cowards are constantly afraid and live in fear of death, experiencing the fear of dying many times before they die. On the other hand, brave people face death without fear and only experience it once.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) Give the synonym of ‘Gallant’. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A synonym for ‘Gallant’ is brave. It refers to someone bold and fearless in the face of danger or adversity.

           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Answer Any Five of the following six questions in about 30-40 words each. (5 × 2 = 10)
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) What was the frog’s ulterior motive in making the nightingale add frills and trills to her songs? (The Frog and the Nightingale) (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The frog made the nightingale sing repeatedly to earn more money. He added more frills and trills to her voice so that, with time, her voice would be ruined and he would remain the sole superior singer of the bog.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Why did Michael enjoy playing the psycho drive games? (Virtually True) (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Michael enjoyed playing the psycho drive games because the big screen with the loud volume made him feel like he was inside the game, battling it out. These games are played with a virtual reality visor and glove. Which made, Michael feel that he was part of the game. Further, it helped him to set up interconnectivity between the real world and the virtual world.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) What was the poet’s reaction when he saw the snake at the water trough? (Snake) (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When the poet saw the snake at the water trough, he stopped immediately but was not afraid of it. Rather, he was curious. He observed its movements closely and was fascinated by the snake.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) What does the expression ‘Counting your chickens before they are hatched’ mean? In what context was it spoken in the chapter Patol Babul (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The expression means to get excited about the outcome of something even before it has actually happened. These words were spoken by Patol Babu’s wife when he started imagining his acting career and rising to fame.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) Was Julius Caesar proud and overconfident? Why? (Julius Caesar) (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Yes, Julius Caesar was proud of his achievements. He was a great warrior and a fair leader. But he was overconfident. He paid a very heavy price because of his overconfidence and ignorance towards his wife’s intuition. Had he paid attention to what his wife was saying and not been overconfident, he would have not been murdered by others.
          </p>
          <p>
           (vi) Why did the villagers and Miss Mebbin hide the fact that Mrs. Packletide had not killed the tiger? (Mrs. Packletide’s Tiger) (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The villagers and Miss Mebbin hid the fact that Mrs. Packletide had missed the shot and not killed the tiger to get the money. The villagers were getting Rs 1000 while Miss Mebbin was also getting a financial reward.

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Answer ANY ONE of the following two questions in about 150 words. [8]
           <br/>
           (A) How do the themes of power, impermanence, and human folly in Satyajit Ray’s ‘Patrol Babu’ and Percy Bysshe Shelley’s ‘Ozymandias’ reflect the universal values of hubris and the transience of human achievements? Provide examples from both texts and extrapolate on how these themes resonate in contemporary society.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           (B) Victoria Slater is truly attached to her grandfather. She is confused by the behaviour of the elders at home and their attitude towards the old man.
           <br/>
           Victoria wrote a diary entry of not more than 150 words, outlining the incidents and the elders’ feelings toward the misfortune.
           <br/>
           (The Dear Departed)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (A) The themes of power, impermanence, and human folly are evident in both Satyajit Ray’s “Patrol
           <br/>
           Babu” and Percy Bysshe Shelley’s “Ozymandias,” highlight universal values of hubris and the fleeting nature of human accomplishments.
           <br/>
           In “Patrol Babu,” the protagonist, Nishikanto, is a low-level government clerk who becomes obsessed with the power he wields over a seemingly insignificant village. His actions reflect the folly of individuals who misuse their authority, believing it to be absolute. This mirrors the theme of power and its corrupting influence, a timeless commentary on the human condition.
           <br/>
           On the other hand, “Ozymandias” portrays the ruins of a once-mighty civilization, with the inscription “Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!” This serves as a stark reminder of the impermanence of even the most grandiose achievements. Shelley’s poem underscores the futility of human hubris, as all that remains is a shattered statue in a desolate desert. These themes transcend time and resonate in contemporary society, where the consequences of unchecked power and the fleeting nature of human triumphs continue to be relevant. They serve as cautionary tales, urging individuals to remain humble and mindful of the transient nature of their actions and legacies.

           Dear Diary
           <br/>
           I am quite confused by the behavior of the elders towards my grandfather. As soon as they found him to be dead, it was as if Mother was in a hurry to divide Grandpa’s belongings. She informed Aunt Elizabeth who arrived along with her uncle. To my shock, none of them were feeling sad about the departed soul. Rather they started fighting for Grandpa’s property. Is this what we call love and affection? Bureau, grandpa’s slippers, and many other things were gaining priority at that moment. My mother and aunt forgot that their father was dead.
           <br/>
           They were being so materialistic. It was a terrible experience. Thank God! Grandpa is still alive. Now I wonder if would they accept if I paid them back in the same coin.
           <br/>
