            The Royal couple had nine daughters.
           </li>
           <li>
            They were named after the months of the year because the queen could not recall

           <li>
            The peculiar habit of the king was to give gifts on his birthday rather than receive them. Usually people get gifts on their birthdays.

            <strong>
             (i)
            </strong>
            Princess September took the loss of her parrot to heart. She wept continuously.
            <br/>
            She was put to sleep without supper.
            <br/>
            <strong>
             (ii)
            </strong>
            Her Mother said that Princess September’s weeping was simply nonsense. She asked the maids to put the child to sleep without supper.
            <br/>
            <strong>
             (iii)
            </strong>
            The princess was very simple-hearted and sensitive. She was stricken with grief when her parrot died. But the Queen mother was not moved at all. She had nothing to console the child.
           </li>
           <li>
            The coming of a little song bird into her room comforted Princess September. She was so enchanted that she forgot about her loss.
           </li>
           <li>
            The Maids of Honour brought in the princess’s breakfast. The song bird ate rice out of the princess’s hand and then sang sweetly. The Maids were surprised to find September so much happy. They were convinced that the two had become good friends.
           </li>
           <li>
            The old parrots only repeated what they had been taught. They could only say ‘God save the King’ and “Pretty Polly’.
           </li>
           <li>
            The King had a low opinion about his Councillors because like parrots, they too repeated the same thing differently.

            <br/>
            <strong>
             (ii)
            </strong>
            They did that because they felt jealous of the song bird’s friendship with Princess September.

            The sisters advised the Princess to put the little bird into the cage lest it should fly away for ever.

            The circumstance was that the bird hadn’t come back because of the party at his father-in-law’s house. The princess was naturally worried. The remark of the sis­ters added to her worry.
           </li>

            The bird disliked his imprisonment. He stopped singing.
           </li>
           <li>
            The bird said that he won’t be really happy and normal if he was taken out in her cage. The rice-fields arid the lake looked quite different and dull when seen through the cage bars.

            <strong>
             (ii)
            </strong>
            The Princess kept the window open so that the bird might fly in and out making fresh air charming. Freedom helped the bird to sing and enjoy himself.

           After the death of her lovely parrot; Princess September got the company of a little song bird. He comforted her with his sweet songs. One day, her sisters advised her to put the bird into a cage lest he should fly. Princess September loved the bird too much to take chances. So, she acted upon their advice.

           I am the ninth daughter of the royal couple of Siam. My father,- the King, used to give gifts to us on his birthdays. One year, on his birthday he gave each one of the princesses a green parrot in a golden cage. I also got a parrot in a golden cage. All other sisters taught the bird to say ‘God save the King’ and ‘Pretty Polly’. But I was different from them. Unfortunately my parrot died one day. I wept and wept. I slept without supper. At night a small song bird flew into my room. It sang so sweetly that I forgot the loss of my parrot. I showed it to my sisters. They grew jealous of my happiness. They advised me to put the bird in a cage. And I acted foolishly upon that advice. The bird stopped singing. It appeared to be dead. So I set it free. I then had the last laugh. I was married to a Prince of Combodia while my sisters were ugly and were married to my father’s councillors.

           Princess September was different from her elder sisters. She was sweet-natured and simple-hearted. She cried bitterly when her parrot died. A little bird made her happy with his song. Her sisters were jealous, mean and wicked. They made a plan to rob her of her happiness. They told her to put the bird in a cage. Their wicked plan worked for a while. The bird stopped singing in captivity. Princess September cared more for the bird’s life than her own happiness. So she let him off. She was duly rewarded for her goodness.
