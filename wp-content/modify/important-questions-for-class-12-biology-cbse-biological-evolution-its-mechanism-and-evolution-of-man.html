           <strong>
            1
           </strong>
           .The important theories related to biological evolution are:
           <br/>
           (i) Lamarckism or Lamarck’s theory of evolution.
           <br/>
           (ii)Darwinian theory of evolution.
           <br/>
           (iii) Mutation theory of evolution.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            2.Lamarck’s theory of evolution
           </strong>
           states that life forms occurred due to the use and disuse of organs.
           <br/>
           Example Giraffes in beginning did not have long necks. Gradually, their necks became longer to access leaves from taller trees. This acquired character passed on to further generations and finally giraffes acquired long necks. This is called
           <strong>
            inheritance of acquired characters.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           (i)Lamarck explained this theory in his book Philosphie Zoologique.
           <br/>
           (ii)
           <strong>
            August Weismann
           </strong>
           offered the greatest opposition to the inheritance of acquired characters and put forward his
           <strong>
            theory of continuity of germplasm in 1892.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            3.Darwin’s theory of evolution
           </strong>
           is explained by Charles Robert Darwin in his book,
           <br/>
           ‘On the Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection’. It is based on his observations during a sea voyage around the world in ship HMS Beagle. The two key concepts of Darwinism are
           <strong>
            branching descent
           </strong>
           (adaptive radiation) and
           <strong>
            natural selection.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           According to this theory:
           <br/>
           (i)There has been gradual evolution of life forms with new forms arising at different periods of history.
           <br/>
           (ii)Population of all organisms have variations in characteristics, which make them adapt better to environment.
           <br/>
           (iii)Some of these characteristics enable individuals to survive better in natural conditions and reproduce. This is called survival of the fittest.
           <br/>
           (iv)The organisms which adapt well in the environment will be selected by nature and will survive more in nature. This is called natural selection.
           <br/>
           (v)Adaptability is inherited and fitness is the end result of ability to adapt and get selected by nature.
           <br/>
           (vi)Natural selection is based on following facts:
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Limited natural resources.
           </li>
           <li>
            Varying characteristics in members of a population.
           </li>
           <li>
            Variations are generally inherited.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Population size is stable except seasonal fluctuation.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            4.Examples of Natural Selection
           </strong>
           <br/>
           (i)Industrial Melanism
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Before industrial revolution in England, white-winged moths were more in number than dark-winged moths.
           </li>
           <li>
            After industrialisation, dark-winged moths became more than white-winged moths.
           </li>
           <li>
            This is because during industrialisation, tree trunks covered by white lichens became dark due to air pollution (dust and soot particles).
           </li>
           <li>
            Due to this, white-winged moths could be easily eaten up by the predators as they fails to camouflage
           </li>
          </ul>

           (ii)
           <strong>
            Chemical Resistance
           </strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The excess use of herbicides and pesticides leads to resistant varieties of microbes in very less time.
           </li>
           <li>
            Due to this, pathogenic bacteria appeared in very short period.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           <strong>
            5.Mutation theory of evolution
           </strong>
           was put forth by Hugo de Vries based on his work on evening primrose.
           <br/>
           (i) It states that evolution occurs by sudden large differences in the population, i.e. mutation and not by minor changes as Darwin stated.
           <br/>
           (ii)The mutation caused speciation and de Vries called it
           <strong>
            saltation
           </strong>
           or
           <strong>
            single step
           </strong>
           <strong>
            large mutation.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           (iii)Mutations are random and directionless, while variations are small and directional as per Darwin.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            6.Hardy-Weinberg principle
           </strong>
           states that allele frequencies in a population are stable and is constant from generation to generation, i.e. gene pool is constant. This is called genetic equilibrium or Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
           <br/>
           (i)It can be expressed by following equation:
           <br/>
           p
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
           + 2pq + q
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
           = 1
           <br/>
           where, p and q are frequencies of different alleles.
           <br/>
           (ii)Any fluctuation in genetic equilibrium leads to evolution.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           <strong>
            7.
           </strong>
           Factors which affect Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are:
           <br/>
           (i)Gene migration or gene flow Due to migration, new genes or alleles are added to the new population and these are lost from the old population, in turn, changing the frequencies. There would be a gene flow if this gene migrations, happens multiple times.
           <br/>
           (ii)
           <strong>
            Genetic drift
           </strong>
           Changes occurring in frequencies by chance is called genetic drift. Sometimes due to changes in allele frequency in new population, some different species are formed. This is called founder effect and the original drifted population is called
           <strong>
            founder.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           (iii)
           <strong>
            Mutations
           </strong>
           These occur randomly and at very slow rates. They lead to new phenotypes and due to considerable genetic variation, speciation occurs.
           <br/>
           (iv)
           <strong>
            Recombination
           </strong>
           During gametogenesis, crossing over in meiosis leads to new combination of genes.
           <br/>
           (v)
           <strong>
            Natural selection
           </strong>
           It occurs due to the inheritance of variations which leads to survival of the fittest.
           <br/>
           It has following effects:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Stabilisation Larger number of individuals acquire mean character value.
           </li>
           <li>
            Directional change Large number of individuals acquire value other than mean character value.
           </li>
           <li>
            Disruption More individuals acquire peripheral character value at both ends of the distribution curve.

            8.A Brief Account of Evolution
           </strong>
           <br/>
           (i)About 2000 million years ago (mya), the first cellular form of life appeared on earth.
           <br/>
           (ii)Some of these cells had the ability to release 0
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           similar to the light reaction in photosynthesis.
           <br/>
           (iii)Slowly, single-celled organisms became multicellular life forms.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            9.Evolution of plants
           </strong>
           Occurred before animals.
           <br/>
           (i)Bryophytes evolved before the vascular plants-like pteridophytes and gymnosperms.
           <br/>
           (ii)Vascular plants first originated in Silurian period.
           <br/>
           (iii)Existence of sea weeds and few plants were reported around 320 years ago (mya)

           <strong>
            10.Evolution of animals
           </strong>
           Occurred around 500 mya.
           <br/>
           (i)First animals were invertebrates.
           <br/>
           (ii)Jawless fish and amphibious fish originated around 350 mya.
           <br/>
           (iii)The first amphibians and ancestors of modern day frogs were lobefins (Coelacanth).
           <br/>
           (iv)Reptiles dominated the earth, around 200 mya.
           <br/>
           (v)Land reptiles were dinosaurs of which Tyrannosaurus rex was biggest. They disappeared around 65 mya.
           <br/>
           (vi)
           <strong>
            In Jurassic period,
           </strong>
           the first mammal like shrews were evolved.
           <br/>
           (vii)Mammals were viviparous and protected their unborn young inside the mother’s body.
           <br/>
           (viii) When reptiles came down, mammals took over the earth.

           </strong>
           .In England, prior to industrialisation the tree trunks were covered with white lichens, and therefore white moths could survive and got protected from predators due to white colour, whereas black (a dark winged moths) could be easily identified due to dark colour and declined in numbers.
           <br/>
           But as industrialisation progressed, the lichens were replaced by soot and dust particles and dark coloured moth were benefitted due to camouflage, while white winged moths could be easily eaten up by the predators being easily identifiable. Thus, only the dark winged moth who were able to fit and survive in conditions reproduced well in nature. This is how natural selection operates in nature.

            Ans
           </strong>
           .Hugo de Vries worked on evening primrose and put forth an idea that large differences arise suddenly in population. He believed that it is mutation which causes evolution and not the minor variations that Darwin talked about. Mutations are random and directionless, while Darwinian variations are small and directional
           <br/>
           Evolution was gradual for Darwin, while de Vries believed mutation caused speciation and hence called it saltation (single step large mutation).

           <br/>
           <strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           Due to industrialisation in England, the trees became covered with soot and dust particles. As a result, more melanised moths were found because they could camouflage themselves with the blackish environment formed by air pollution.Prior to industrialisation, there were more white-winged moths, because lichens were grown on the tree trunks and the melanic moths were easily detected by the predators. This explains why the distribution of white-winged and melanised moths changed because of industrialisation.

           <strong>
            Gene migration
           </strong>
           Due to migration, new genes or alleles are added to the population and are lost from the old population in turn, changing the frequencies. Migration when happens multiple times, is termed as gene flow.

           <strong>
            Genetic drift
           </strong>
           Changes occurring in frequencies by chance is called genetic drift. Due to changes in allele frequency in new population, some different species are formed. This is called founder effect and the original population is called founder.
           <br/>
           (iii)
           <strong>
            Mutations

           <br/>
           (ii)There may be change in the frequency of genes and alleles in the future generations.

           <strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           (i)
           <strong>
            Hardy-Weinberg principle
           </strong>
           states that the allele frequencies in a population are stable and remain constant from generation to generation, i.e. gene pool is constant or genetic equilibrium or Hardy Weinberg equilibrium is maintained.
           <br/>
           It can be explained by following equation p
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
           + 2pq + q
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
           =1
           <br/>
           Where, p and q are frequencies of different alleles.
           <br/>
           (ii) Genetic Drift
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            It refers to the changes in allele frequencies that occur only by chance events.
           </li>
           <li>
            Sometimes the change in an allele frequency is so different in the new sample of population, that they become a different species.
           </li>
           <li>
            Originally drifted population become the founder and such an effect is called founder effect.

           </strong>
           .Hugo de Vries explained that new species arise from pre-existing ones in a single generation by a sudden appearance of marked differences called mutations. He believed that it is mutation which causes evolution.

           <strong>
            Ans
           </strong>
           .(i)The members of a population vary in characteristics even though they look similar. The population will increase exponentially but the natural resources are limited leading to more competition. The individuals which are fit and adapt themselves are able to survive. They grow reproduce and survive. This is called natural selection by Darwin.
           <br/>
           (ii)Darwin’s theory states that the fitness of an organism is measured by its reproductive ability. The appearance of new forms is linked to the life span of an organism. The greater the life span, the more it can reproduce and hence, greater new forms would appear. This can be observed in the development of dark-winged moths due to industrial melanism.

           variation is much reduced.

           (i)The forelimbs of cheetah, bats and human have a similar anatomical structure. These have bones, humerus, radius, ulna, carpals, metacarpals and phalanges. It indicates divergent evolution, where the same structure has developed along different directions as adaption to different ‘ needs.
           <br/>
           Such structures are called homologous organs and homology indicates common ancestry.
