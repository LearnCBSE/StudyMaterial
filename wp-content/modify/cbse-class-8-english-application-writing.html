           1. To a Principal to improve the hygienic conditions in the school.
           <br/>
           You are Naresh of Kendriya Vidyalaya, Ranchi. Write an application to your Principal
           <br/>
           drawing his/her attention to improve the hygienic conditions in your school.

           <br/>
           Sir
           <br/>
           Kindly permit me to make a suggestion. It is about the hygienic conditions in the school.
          </p>
          <p>
           Sir, our school is one of the most reputed schools in the state. Our students have come off with flying colours in every field. Our teachers are also well qualified and devoted to teaching. Yet, our school building does not give the same good impression. The sweepers do not sweep well. As a result dirt and dust is seen everywhere. The toilets are very dirty. They stink a lot. To avoid that foul smell, many students make water on the walls of the building. This results in worsening the conditions.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           You are, therefore, requested to improve the hygienic conditions of the school.
           <br/>
           With thanks
           <br/>
           Yours obediently
           <br/>
