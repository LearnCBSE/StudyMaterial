           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Beams of electrons and protons move parallel to each other in the same direction. They
           <br/>
           (a) attract each other
           <br/>
           (b) repel each other
           <br/>
           (c) neither attract nor repel
           <br/>
           (d) force of attraction or repulsion depends upon speed of beams.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (b) repel each other
          </p>
          <p>
           Since, direction of current is taken in opposite direction of flow of electron or in the direction of flow of proton. Hence, beam of electrons and protons moving parallel to each other in the same direction produce current in opposite direction. Therefore, they repel each other.

           <br/>
           (a) B
           <br/>
           (b) E
           <br/>
           (c) E × B
           <br/>
           (d)B × E

           Question 16.
           <br/>
           Assertion (A) Diamagnetic substances exhibit magnetism.
           <br/>
           Reason (R) Diamagnetic materials do not have permanent magnetic dipole moment.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Both Assertion (A) Reason (R) are true and Reason (R) is the correct explanation of Assertion (A).
          </p>
          <p>
           Diamagnetic substances exhibit magnetism due to absence unpaired electrons, diamagnetic materials do not have permanent magnetic dipole moment, thus both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 17.
           <br/>
           Assertion (A) Work done in moving a charge around a closed path in an electric field is always zero.
           <br/>
           Reason (R) Electrostatic force is a conservative force.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Both Assertion (A) Reason (R) are true and Reason (R) is the correct explanation of Assertion (A).
          </p>
          <p>
           As electrostatic force is conservative force, so reason is true. Also, conservative force means work done doesn’t depend on path followed and work done in moving a charge around a closed path in an electric field is always zero for conservative force. Therefore, both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are true and Reason (R) is the correct explanation of Assertion (A).

           Question 18.
           <br/>
           Assertion (A) In Young’s double slit experiment, all fringes are of equal width.
           <br/>
           Reason (R) The fringe width depends upon wavelength of light (A) used, the distance of screen from plane of slits (D) and slits separation (d).
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Both Assertion (A) Reason (R) are true and Reason (R) is the correct explanation of Assertion (A).
          </p>
          <p>
           Since, the formula for fringe width does not depend on the position of the fringes, all the fringes in Young’s double slit experiment are of equal width. Therefore, both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are true and Reason (R) is the correct explanation of Assertion (A).

           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) No interference pattern is detected. When two coherent sources are infinitely close.
           <br/>
           (ii) If the sources are far apart d is large, so fringe width (P) will be so small that the fringes are not resolved and they do not appear separate. That’s why, the interference pattern is not detected for large separation of coherent sources.

           Question 23.
           <br/>
           (i) What is meant by ionisation energy ?
           <br/>
           Write its value for hydrogen atom.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (ii) Define the term mass defect. How is it related to stability of the nucleus ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) The minimum energy required to free the
           <br/>
           electron from the ground state of H-atom is called ionisation energy.
           <br/>
           The ionisation energy for H-atom,
           <br/>
           E = E
           <sub>
            ∞
           </sub>
           – E
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           <br/>
           E = 0 – (-13.6)
           <br/>
           E = 13.6 eV
          </p>
          <p>
           Or
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The difference between the sum of the rest masses of its constituent nucleons and the rest mass of a nucleus is called mass defect.
           <br/>
           Mass defect is related to the stability of the nucleus because the magnitude of the mass defect is proportional to the nuclear binding energy, both values indicate the stability of the nucleus. Just as a molecule is more stable (lower in energy) than its isolated atoms, a nucleus is more stable than its isolated components.

           Question 24.
           <br/>
           Draw energy band diagram for an n-type and p-type semiconductor at T &gt; 0K.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Energy Band in Extrinsic Semiconductors: In extrinsic semiconductors, additional energy states due to donor impurities (E
           <sub>
            D
           </sub>
           ) and acceptor impurities (EA) also exist. In the energy band diagram of n-type semiconductor, the donor energy level ED is slightly below the bottom Ec of conduction band and the electrons from this level move into conduction band with very small supply of energy.
          </p>
          <p>
           In p-type semiconductors, the acceptor energy level EA is slightly above the top energy level Ev of the valence band. With very small supply of energy an electron from the valence band can jump to the level EA and ionise the acceptor negatively.

           Answer the following giving reasons :
           <br/>
           (i) A p-n junction diode is damaged by a strong current.
           <br/>
           (ii) Impurities are added in intrinsic semiconductors.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) A p-n junction diode is get damaged by a strong current because it gets heat up.
           <br/>
           (ii) Intrinsic semiconductors are pure semiconductors. We add the impurities in functionality and increase its conductivity.

           Question 27.
           <br/>
           Define current density and relaxation time. Derive an expression for resistivity of a conductor in terms of number density of charge carriers in the conductor and relaxation time.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Current Density: The current density at a point in a conductor is defined as the amount of current flowing normally through unit area around that point of conductor.
           <br/>
           If a current I is distributed uniformly over the cross-section area A of a conductor, then the current density at that point is
           <br/>
           \(\mathcal{F}\) = \(\frac{I}{A}\)
           <br/>
           It is a vector quantity and the SI unit of current density is Am

            2
           </sup>
           .
           <br/>
           Relaxation Time: The average time-interval between two successive collision is called the relaxation time of the electron. It is denoted by τ.
           <br/>
           Its value is the order of 10

           Question 29.
           <br/>
           Define critical angle for a given pair of media and total internal reflection. Obtain the relation between the critical angle and refractive index of the medium.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Critical angle for a pair of given media in contact can be defined as, “the angle of incidence in denser medium for which angle of refraction in rarer is 90°”. If the angle of incidence of light, when travelling from a denser medium to a rarer medium, is greater than the critical angle, then total internal reflection takes place.

           <br/>
           (b) Prove that the density of a nucleus is independent of its mass number.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) (a) Differences between Nuclear Fission and Nuclear Fusion.
           <br/>
           I. Fission is the splitting of large nucleus into two or more smaller ones, on the other hand, fusion is the combining of two or more lighter nuclei to form a heavier more stable nucleus.
           <br/>
           II. Fission does not normally occur in nature but fusion occurs in stars such as the sun.
           <br/>
           III. Fission requires critical mass of the substance and high speed neutrons but in fusion, high density and high temperature environment are required.
           <br/>
           IV. In fission, energy released is million times greater than in chemical reactions, but lower than energy released by nuclear fusion.
           <br/>
           V. Uranium is the primary fuel for fission reaction and hydrogen isotopes are the primary fuel in nuclear fusion reaction.
           <br/>
           VI. Atom bomb is based upon the nuclear fision while hydrogen bomb is based upon the fusion of heavy hydrogen nuclei.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Binding Energy Curve or Releasing Binding Energy It is a plot of the binding energy per nucleon £bn versus the mass number A for a large number of nuclei.

           compared to that of a nucleus with A =120. Thus, if a nucleus A= 240 breaks into two A =120 nuclei, nucleons get more tightly bound. Energy would be released in this process (nuclear fission).

           II. When two light nuclei (A ≤ 10) combine to form a heavier nucleus, E

           Theory and Working: As the armature of coil is rotated in uniform magnetic field,the magnetic flux linked with the coil changes and an emf is induced in the coil. Hence current flow in it.
           <br/>
           Suppose the coil is rotating clockwise and is horizontal of some instance of time. At this instant, the arm AB of the coil is moving up and the arm CD is moving down.
           <br/>
           According to Fleming’s right hand rule, the current flows from A to B in the arm AB and C to D in the arm CD.
           <br/>
           The brush B
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           at which the current is entering the external circuit is positive relative to the brush B
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           at which the current is leaving the external circuit. During the time the coil rotates to the vertical position, the current in the armature will flow in the direction ABCD. Now the coil ABCD reaches the vertical position, the arms AD and CD move momentarily parallel to the field. So, in vertical position, the induced emf (current) is zero.
           <br/>
           After half the rotation of coil, the arm AB moves down and the arm CD moves up. The current flow from B to A in arm AB and D to C in the arm CD.
           <br/>
           The brush B
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           is now positive relative to B
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           and remains so long as the coil reaches the vertical position again.
           <br/>
           After this, B
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           is again positive relative to B
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           .
           <br/>
           Hence, induced current in the external circuit changes direction after every half rotation of the coil. Hence, the current induced is alternating in a nature. Instantaneous value of the emf Consider a coil of N turns and area A being rotated at a constant angular velocity co in a magnetic field B.
           <br/>
           When the normal to the coil is at an angle θ to the field, the magnetic flux through the coil is given by
           <br/>
           ϕ = BAN cos θ
           <br/>
           ϕ = BAN cos ωt (θ = ωt)

           Emf E = \(-\frac{d \phi}{d t}\) = \(\frac{d(B A N \cos \theta)}{d t}\)

           Question 33.
           <br/>
           (i) (a) State Huygens’ principle. With the help of a diagram, show how a plane wave is reflected from a surface. Hence, verify the law of reflection.
           <br/>
           (b) A convex lens of focal length 12 cm produces three times magnified real image. Find the distance between object and image.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (ii) (a) Draw a labelled ray diagram showing the image formation by a refracting telescope. Define its magnifying power. Write two limitations of a refracting telescope over a reflecting telescope.
           <br/>
           (b) The focal lengths of the objective and the eye piece of a compound microscope are 1.0 cm and 2.5 cm, respectively. Find the tube length of the microscope for obtaining a magnification of 300.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) (a) Huygens’ Principle Each point on the given wavefront (called primary wavefront) is the source of a secondary disturbance (called secondary wavelets) and the wavelets emanating from these points spread out in all directions with the speed of the wave.
           <br/>
           The speed with which the wavefront moves outwards from the source is called the speed of the wave. The energy of the wave travels in a direction perpendicular to the wavefront.
           <br/>
           Reflection at a Plane Surface: Let 1, 2, 3 be the incident rays and f, 2′, 3′ be the corresponding reflected rays.
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 12 Physics Set 2 with Solutions 26" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-153879" height="452" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 362px) 100vw, 362px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-12-Physics-Set-2-with-Solutions-26.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-12-Physics-Set-2-with-Solutions-26.png 362w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-12-Physics-Set-2-with-Solutions-26-240x300.png 240w" width="362"/>
           <br/>
           For rays of light from different parts on the incident wavefront, the values of AF are different. But light from different points of the incident wavefront should take the same time to reach the corresponding points on the reflected wavefront.
           <br/>
           So, t should not depend upon AF.This is possible only, if
           <br/>
           sin i – sin r = 0
           <br/>
           i.e, sin i = sin r
           <br/>
           or ∠i = ∠r
           <br/>
           which is the first law of reflection. Further, the incident wavefront AB, the reflecting surface XY and the reflected wavefront CD are all perpendicular to the plane of the paper.
           <br/>
           Therefore, incident ray, normal to the mirror XY and reflected ray all lie in the plane of the paper. This proves the
           <br/>
           second law of reflection.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) ∴ \(\frac{1}{v}\) – \(\frac{1}{u}\) = \(\frac{1}{12}\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ \(\frac{u-v}{uv}\) = \(\frac{1}{12}\)
           <br/>
           ∴m = \(-\frac{v}{u}\) = 3 = v = -3u
           <br/>
           ∵ \(\frac{1}{2}\) = \(\frac{1}{12}\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ u = -16 cm
           <br/>
           ∴ v = 48 cm
           <br/>
           So, u – v = 64 cm
          </p>
          <p>
           OR
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) (a) An astronomical telescope is an optical instrument which is used for observing distinct images of heavenly bodies like stars, planets, etc., when the final image is formed at infinity.
           <br/>
           Astronomical telescope has two convex lenses coaxially separated by some distance. The lens towards the object is called objective and has much larger aperture than the eyepiece of the lens towards the eye.
           <br/>
           Working Light from the distant object enters the objective and real image is formed at second focal point of objective. The eyepiece magnifies this image producing a final inverted image.

           Advantages of Reflecting Telescope over Refracting Telescope
           <br/>
           For astronomical telescope, the mirror affords several advantages over the objective lens.
           <br/>
           I. A mirror is easier to produce with a larger diameter, so that it can intercept rays crossing a larger area and direct them to the eyepiece.
           <br/>
           II. The mirror can be made parabolic to reduce spherical aberration
           <br/>
           (b) ∴ m = \(\frac{1}{2}\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ 300 = \(\frac{1}{2}\) ⇒ 300 = -L(11)
           <br/>
           ⇒ |L| = \(\frac{300}{11}\) cm

           <br/>
           (i) Consider the experimental set-up shown in the figure. This jumping ring experiment is an outstanding demonstration of some simple laws of Physics. A conducting non-magnetic ring is placed over the vertical core of a solenoid. When current is passed through the solenoid the ring is thrown off.

           Answer the following questions
           <br/>
           (a) Explain the reason of jumping of the ring when the switch is closed in the circuit.
           <br/>
           (b) What will happen, if the terminals of the battery are reversed and the switch is closed? Explain.
           <br/>
           (c) Explain the two laws that help us understand this phenomenon.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (ii) Briefly explain various ways to increase the strength of magnetic field produced by a given solenoid.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) (a) Magnetic flux change in the coil due to which induced current play a role but this current oppose the change in flux which cause jumping of the ring when the switch is closed.
           <br/>
           (b) Polarity of current change and direction of induced emf also change.
           <br/>
           (c) There are two laws
           <br/>
           I. Faraday’s first law Whenever the amount of flux linked with a circuit, an emf is induced in the circuit. This induced emf persists as long as the change in magnetic flux continues.
           <br/>
           Faraday’s second law The magnitude of the induced emf is equal to the time rate of change of flux.
           <br/>
           Induced flux, ε = \(-\frac{d \phi}{dt}\)
           <br/>
           II. Lenz law This law gives us the direction of induced emf. According to this law, the direction of induced emf in a circuit is such that it opposes the change in magnetic flux.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (ii) As we know, magnetic field, B = μ

           (i) Figure shows the variation of photoelectric current measured in a photo cell circuit as a function of the potential difference between the plates of the photo cell when light beams A,B,C and D of different wavelength are incident on the photocell. Examine the given figure and answer the following questions:
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 12 Physics Set 2 with Solutions 5" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-153858" height="215" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-12-Physics-Set-2-with-Solutions-5.png" width="255"/>
           <br/>
           (a) Which light beam has the highest frequency and why ?
           <br/>
           (b) Which light beam has the longest wavelength and why ?
           <br/>
           (c) Which light beam ejects photoelectron with maximum momentum and why ?
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (ii) What is the effect on threshold frequency and stopping potential on increasing the frequency of incident beam of light ? Justify your answer.
           <br/>
           (a) A has the highest frequency because A having lowest wavelength and highest photocurrent. Thus, A will be highest.
           <br/>
           E = hv = \(\frac{h c}{\lambda}\)
           <br/>
           (b) D light beam has the longest wavelength because B having lowest frequency and lowest photocurrent. Thus, D will be lowest.
           <br/>
           (c) A light beam ejects photoelectron with maximum momentum due to having highest frequency which is highest as compared to threshold frequency.
           <br/>
           ϕ = \(\frac{h v}{c}=\frac{h}{\lambda}\)
           <br/>
           Maximum momentum means having lowest frequency.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (ii) As we know, stopping potential
           <br/>
           eV

            incident
           </sub>
           – ϕ, where ϕ is the work function of the metal surface and vincident is the frequency of incident radiation. Thus, stopping potential increase with increase in frequency of incident radiation. If incident frequency above or below, then threshold frequency no photoelectric emission occurs.
