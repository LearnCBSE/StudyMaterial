           Health is the real wealth. Every student must try to keep good health. It is not very difficult to do so. The first requirement is—’Early to bed and early to rise’. Morning air is fresh. We should take exercise in this air. Then good food is also necessary. We should avoid junk food. Milk and some butter must be a part of our diet. We should take meals at regular times. It is not good to keep on eating something or the other all the time. Then for a healthy body. We need a tension-free mind. It is possible if we do not postpone our work.

           Small family is always a happy family. More mouths mean more demands. It is very difficult to meet these needs these days. There is poverty in the country. Then many persons in the country do not have good jobs. They barely manage to live within their means. In a small family food, clothing, education, health etc, can be looked after. We can give the small family quality things. They would go higher in their lives. In short, they would become successful in their careers. Their lives will be full of pleasure and devoid of worry.

The fields present a very beautiful scene. One is always at peace in the village. The food is pure and simple. It is very good for health. It is not adulterated as it is in the cities. Then there is no noise in the village. There is no traffic-jam. One can walk leisurely in a village.

           There are many disadvantages of living in a big city. Life in it is always full of tension. Everybody seems to be in a hurry and suffering from worry. Things are always not within reach. But they are available in black market. Facilities are limited. There is always a crowd. Buses and trains do not come in time. They are always very crowded too. Then one can’t cross the roads easily. There are big and tall buildings and big colonies. Natural scenes are absent in big cities. Fresh air is not easily available. Everything is artificial.

           Students are always afraid of their Principals. The Principals want their students to progress in life. If they do not do their work, they beat them. Then the Principals enforce discipline among their students. But if I were the Principal, I would endear myself to them. I would remove the causes of fear from their minds. I would see that they are not afraid of me. I would see that their hidden talents are out. I would solve their problems regarding their studies. I would be their friend, philosopher and guide.

She takes a bath and prays. Then she starts working. She looks after the house. She helps my mother in the kitchen. She even goes to the nearby shops to buy things. She takes me to the bus stand. When I come from school, she takes me back home. She also helps me in my studies. She feeds the sparrows during the afternoon. I love her very much.

           Ideal persons are rare in life. It is more so in the field of education. An ideal teacher is one who loves to learn and to teach. His mission in life is teaching. He sacrifices his every thing for the cause of education. He is always giving knowledge to his students. He has no interest in money or power. His only aim in life is to teach his students to be good persons. An ideal teacher is above worldly pleasures. He is like a saint who serves the people selflessly.

           Environmental Pollution is now a global problem. It is a great danger to human life. There is air, water and sound pollution. Air pollution is caused by vehicles’ and factories’ smoke. It contains carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. These cause diseases like asthma. Factories release poisonous water into rivers. This pollutes the water. It is not fit for drinking. It causes various water-borne diseases. The sound pollution is caused by music shops, pressure horns and loudspeakers. People become deaf. Their blood pressure rises. It causes heart failure. So environmental pollution is dangerous.

           We find that our moral standards are very low. This may be due to many factors. Morals are very important for the society. So there is a great need of moral education in schools. There are no fellow-feelings among the people. They are always ready to fight. They have anger, ill-will, and jealousy. They have become selfish. They do not think of others. Humanity is vanishing. So to bring back the glory of our age-old culture, moral education is necessary.

It is both my motherland and fatherland. I owe everything to it. I am made from its dust. Man is mortal but the country is immortal. People come and go. But the country and its identity is permanent. It is something sacred and supreme for me. I love my country the most. I wouldn’t hesitate to make any sacrifice for my country.

           I cannot forget this day I made my first speech in school today. Our school had arranged a debate. The topic was ‘We Need One-World-Govemment’. I decided to speak in favour of the motion. About a score of students took part. I had learnt my speech well.
          </p>
          <p>
           There was much clapping as I finished my speech. At the end the principal spoke. It was now the time for the judges to give their judgement I waited with bated breath. When the result was declared, my joys knew no bounds. I had stood first. I cannot forget this day.

           13. Read the following extract from an article in a magazine and then using your own ideas, write an article for your school magazine on the Delights and Usefulness of Walking.
           <br/>
           ‘Walking has its own delights. Sadly, in India walking is associated with deprivation and poverty. “If you have a car, why walk ?” asked the professor, starting his Maruti for the few metres from his house to the college building. Pedestrians get second class treatment.’

           <strong>
            Delights and Usefulness of Walking
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Walking is a pleasure. When we are in a vehicle, our attention is fixed on the road. There is no time for the things on either side of the road. A walker can, however, enjoy the sights on either sides. He can walk slowly when there is much beauty around. He can go fast when he wants his walking to be an exercise. However, no young person should walk thinking that it is an exercise. It will kill all the pleasure. Moreover, there are many other exercises that are good for health. Walking should be made a habit for enjoyment. One should feel relaxed and not tired after a good walk. We should walk only when the weather is fine. We should avoid walking when it is hot or misty.

           Almost in all small hotels, dhabas and tea shops one can see small children working. In small scale industries they work in the most unhygienic conditions. The society reacts to such inhuman scenes with indifference. The responsible people pass by such scenes. Even government officials ignore taking any action against the guilty. There is no doubt that family support is behind this child abuse. It is – poverty and lack of employment that is responsible for it. It is hunger that forces the children to work. One can well imagine what the children feel when they are forced to work. Their sweet childhood is snatched from them. Instead of learning the alphabet, they learn to clean the plates. And this goes on without any prick to our conscience.
