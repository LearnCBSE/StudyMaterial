           <em>
            May my friendships always be

           <br/>
           <em>
            The most important thing to me.
           </em>
           <br/>
           <em>
            With special friends, I feel I’m blessed,
           </em>
           <br/>
           <em>
            So let me give my very best.
           </em>
           <br/>
           <em>
            I want to do much more than share

          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Now, share the details of your underlined parts of the poem in groups and explain why you liked those lines.
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           <em>
            May my friendships always be
           </em>
           <br/>
           <em>
            The most important thing to me.
           </em>
          </p>
          <p>
           This line emphasizes the importance of valuing friendships above all, which resonates with me because I believe strong relationships are vital to happiness and support.
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            With special friends, I feel I’m blessed,
           </em>
           <br/>
           <em>
            So let me give my very best.
           </em>
          </p>
          <p>
           Feeling blessed by friends and wanting to give your best in return highlights the reciprocal nature of true friendship, which I find very meaningful.
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            I want to do much more than share
           </em>
           <br/>
           <em>
            The hopes and plans of friends who care;
           </em>
           <br/>
           <em>
            I’ll try all that a friend can do
           </em>
           <br/>
           <em>
            To make their wishes come true.
           </em>
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           These lines express a deep commitment to supporting friends in all their endeavors, reflecting a selfless and proactive approach to friendship that I deeply value.
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            Let me use my heart to see,
           </em>
           <br/>
           <em>
            To realize what friends can be,
           </em>
           <br/>
           <em>
            And make no judgments from afar,
           </em>
           <br/>
           <em>
            But love my friends the way they are.
           </em>
          </p>
          <p>
           These lines focus on understanding and accepting friends without judgment, which is essential for maintaining genuine and supportive relationships.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Which line was underlined by most people in your group? Share it with your teacher.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           <em>
            Let me use my heart to see,
           </em>
           <br/>
           <em>
            To realize what friends can be,
           </em>
           <br/>
           <em>
            And make no judgments from afar,
           </em>
           <br/>
           <em>
            But love my friends the way they are.
           </em>
          </p>
          <p>
           This line likely resonated the most because it emphasizes unconditional love and acceptance, which are fundamental aspects of true friendship.
          </p>
          <p>
           <span style="color: #0000ff;">

           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Complete the summary of the poem by circling the correct highlighted words.
           <br/>
           The poet says a
           <strong>
            prayer for/speech on
           </strong>
           friendship and friends. She wants friendship should always be an important part of her
           <strong>
            complete life/school days
           </strong>
           . She says that her friendship makes her feel
           <strong>
            brave/special
           </strong>
           . She wishes to do the best she can, for her friends. She wants to
           <strong>
            clap for/listen to
           </strong>
           the wishes of her friends. As a good friend, she
           <strong>
            prays/imagines
           </strong>
           that she can make her friend’s wishes come true. She wants her
           <strong>
            heart/mind
           </strong>
           to understand what a true friend is. She prays that she loves her friends
           <strong>
            as they are/when they are happy
           </strong>
           . She tells us that a true/correct friend accepts their friend for all their qualities.

            “An Unforgettable Encounter”
           </strong>
           <br/>
           When I least expected it, our friendship began. How we met was quite remarkable. It was a sunny afternoon in the park, and I was reading a book. My friend, who was jogging by, accidentally dropped her music player. I returned it to her, and we struck up a conversation. We discovered shared interests and values. It was the formation of a beautiful friendship.

            Let us explore (Page 58)

          </p>
          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           There are many quotations about friendship. Read the ones given below.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            “A friend in need is a friend indeed.”
           </li>
           <li>
            “My best friend is the one who brings out the best in me.”
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (a) What do you think is the meaning of these quotations? Share it with your teacher.
           <br/>
           (b) Think of an experience in your life with your friend that suits this quotation. Share it with your friends.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           An interpretation of the quotations and a personal experience related to each one:
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (a) Meaning of the Quotations:
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <em>
            “A friend in need is a friend indeed.”
           </em>
           <br/>
           This means that a true friend is someone who supports you when you are in trouble or need help. They stand by you during difficult times, proving their friendship through their actions.
           <br/>
           <em>
            “My best friend ¡s the one who brings out the best in me.”
           </em>
           <br/>
           This means that a best friend is someone who encourages you to be the best version of yourself.
           <br/>
           They inspire and motivate you to achieve your potential and support you in your personal growth.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            (b) Personal Experiences:
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <em>
            “A friend in need is a friend indeed.”
           </em>
           <br/>
           Last year, I was going through a tough time because I was struggling with my schoolwork and feeling overwhelmed. My friend noticed that I was not myself and offered to help me study. They spent hours with me, explaining difficult concepts and encouraging me to keep going. Thanks to their support, I managed to improve my grades and felt much better. This experience showed me how valuable a true friend is during challenging times.
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            “My best friend is the one who brings out the best in me.”
           </em>
           <br/>
           During our final year in school, I was very nervous about applying for college and unsure of my abilities. My best friend, however, believed in me and constantly reminded me of my strengths. They encouraged me to apply to my dream college and helped me prepare for the entrance exams. Their unwavering support and belief in me boosted my confidence, and I eventually got accepted into the college. This experience taught me how a true friend can bring out the best in you by believing in your potential.
