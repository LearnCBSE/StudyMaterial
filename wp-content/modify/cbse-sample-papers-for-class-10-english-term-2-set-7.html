           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below.
           <br/>
           Research has shown that the human mind can process words at the rate of about 500 per minute, whereas a speaker speaks at the rate of about 150 words a minute. The difference between the two is 350, which is quite large.
           <br/>
           So, a speaker must make every effort to retain the attention of the audience and the listener should also be careful not to let his/her mind
           <br/>
           5. wander. Good communication calls for good listening skills.
          </p>
          <p>
           Listening starts with hearing but goes beyond that. Hearing, in other words, is necessary but not sufficient for Listening. Listening involves hearing with attention. Listening is a process that calls for attention and concentration.
           <br/>
           While listening, one should be observant. In other words, listening has to do with the ears as well as with the mind.
           <br/>
           10. It calls for participation and involvement.
           <br/>
           It is quite often a dialogue rather than a monologue. It is necessary to make it abundantly clear that one is interested in knowing what the other person has to say.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           Good Listening is an art that can be cultivated.
           <br/>
           A good listener knows the art of getting much more than what the speaker is trying to convey. He/she knows how to prompt, persuade but IS. not to cut-off or interrupt what the other person has to say. At times, the speaker may or may not be coherent, articulate and well-organised in his/her thoughts and expressions. He/she may have it in mind, yet fail to marshal the right words while communicating thoughts. Nevertheless, a good listener puts him/her at ease, helps him/her articulate his/her thoughts. For Listening to be effective, it is also necessary that barriers to listening are removed. Such 20. barriers can be both physical and psychological. Physical barriers generally relate to hindrances to proper hearing, whereas psychological barriers are more fundamental and relate to the interpretation and evaluation of the speaker and the message.
          </p>
          <p>
           Based on your understanding of the passage, answer ANY FIVE questions out of the six given below. (1 × 5)
           <br/>

           <br/>
           (C) Rewrite the following sentence by replacing the underlined phrase with a word that means the same from lines 10-15.
           <br/>
           His mind was as well developed and maintained as his bodily powers; he wrote well, and his observations are generally acute and accurate; he was brave, kindly and generous. (1)
           <br/>
           (D) List one quality of a good listener that makes the listening truly effective. (1)
           <br/>

           <br/>
           (F) How does the writer differentiate between listening and hearing? (1)
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Read the following excerpt from a case study titled ‘Stress and Covid -19.’
           <br/>
           A new study has found that peo pie who experienced increased stress, anxiety and depression at the start of the pandemic. were at greater risk of getting Covid-19.
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 10 English Term 2 Set 7 for Practice 1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-133156" height="206" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-English-Term-2-Set-7-for-Practice-1.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-English-Term-2-Set-7-for-Practice-1.png 384w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-English-Term-2-Set-7-for-Practice-1-300x161.png 300w" width="384"/>
           <br/>
           20. A professor says: “The significance of the work is in that it turns the debate regarding the mental health aspects of the pandemic on its head. Our data show that increased stress, anxiety and depression are not only consequences of living with the pandemic, but may also be factors that increase our risk of getting SARS-CoV-2 too. Further work is now needed to determine whether and how public health policy should change to accommodate the fact that the most distressed people in our communities appear to be at greatest risk of Covid-19 infection.”
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           25. Another professor of Cognitive Behavioural (Psychotherapy from King’s College) London said: “Previous work has shown a clear relationship between distress and the development of viral infections indicating a vulnerability.
           <br/>
           30. Our study found that distress was associated with self-reported Covid-19 infection and the next step is to investigate whether this association is found in those with confirmed infection.”
          </p>
          <p>
           On the basis of your understanding of the passage, answer ANY FIVE questions out of the six given below. (1 × 5)
           <br/>
           (A) Why does the professor from King’s College London, say, ‘Previous work has shown a clear relationship between distress and the development of viral infections indicating a vulnerability? (1)
           <br/>
           (B) Comment on the significance of the need to address the psychological issues with reference to lines 10-20. (1)
           <br/>
           (C) Justify the finding that during the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a well-documented deterioration in psychological well-being and increased social isolation. (1)
           <br/>
           (D) Why does the narrator feel public health policy should change to accommodate the fact ‘‘that the most distressed people in our communities appear to be at greatest risk of Covid-19 infection.” (1)
           <br/>
           (E) People who experienced increased stress, anxiety and depression at the start of the pandemic, were at greater risk of getting Covid-19. How does evidence from the table support the statement? (1)
           <br/>
           (F) What purpose does the data in the passage seem to solve? (1)
