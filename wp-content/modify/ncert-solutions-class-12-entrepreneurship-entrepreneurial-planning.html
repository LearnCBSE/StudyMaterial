           </span>
           No, this approach of the entrepreneur is incorrect. This is because:
           <br/>
           (i)In such situation he will not be utilising the resources fully and this will mean more likely wastage of the resources.
           <br/>

           <br/>

           (iv)He is also not following self control. Self control is a essential trait for the long term success of the enterprise.

             Answer.

           </span>
           Following are the inherent limitations of Sole Proprietorship:
           <br/>
           (i) Limited Capital
           <br/>
           (ii) Limited Managerial Ability
           <br/>
           (iii) Limited Continuity
           <br/>
           In this era of specialization, expansion and diversification, expecting one man to combat them all is not possible. Business acumen and wealth seldom meet in one person. This, desirable combination probably led to emergence of Partnership form of business.
