           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           The scattering of a beam of light is called the Tyndall effect. Tyndall effect can be observed when sunlight passes through the canopy of a dense forest. In a dense forest, the mist contains tiny droplets of water, which act as particles of colloid dispersed in air.

            configuration of its atoms?

           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           (i) The valency of an element is determined by the number of valence electrons present in the atom of the element. Electronic configuration gives the number of valence electrons in its atom. The number of valence electrons decides the number of electrons lost or gained by one atom of an element to achieve the nearest inert gas electron configuration and gives the valency of element.

           <br/>
           X gains 1 electron to achieve the nearest inert gas configuration , i.e,, 2, 8. Therefore the valency of X is ‘T.

            Question.6 How does the electronic configuration of an atom of an element relate to its position in the modern periodic table? Explain with one example.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           The electronic configuration of an atom of an element gives its position in the modem periodic table.
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) The ‘period number’ of an element is equal to the number of electron shells in its atom.

           (ii)

          <ul>
           <li>
            The group number of an element having up to two valence electrons is equal to the
            <br/>
            number of valence electrons.
           </li>
           <li>
            The group number of an element having more than 2 valence electrons is equal to the number of valence electrons plus 10.
            <br/>
            Example: If the electronic configuration of an element is 2, 8, 7
            <br/>
            Then its period number is 3 as it has three electron shells.
            <br/>
            Its group number is 17 as it has 7 valence electrons. (.

            <img alt="cbse-previous-year-question-papers-class-10-science-sa2-delhi-2011-4" class="alignright" height="124" loading="lazy" src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5530/30184742580_c580d00639_o.png" width="296"/>
           </strong>
           <br/>
           (a) Dispersion of light. The splitting of white light into its component colours on passing through a prism is called dispersion of light.
           <br/>
           (b) The planets are much closer to the earth. A planet can be considered as a collection of large number of point-sized sources of light.
           <br/>
           So the total variation in the amount of light entering our eye from all the individual point-sized sources will average out to zero thereby nullifying the twinkling effect. On the other hand stars twinkle because stars are point-sized sources of energy therefore the continuously changing atmosphere causes atmospheric refraction which causes variation in light.

            Question.10 Explain how equal genetic contribution of male and female parents is ensured in the progeny.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Both the parents contribute equal DNA material to progeny. Every sexually reproducing organism bears two sets of all genes, one inherited from each parent. Each germ cell must have only one gene set. Thus the male gamete and female gamete carry one gene for each characteristic from the gene pairs of parents. But when a male gamete fuses with a female gamete during fertilisation, they make a new cell called zygote with a full set of genes. Thus zygote grows and develops to form a new organism having equal characteristics from both the parents which it has inherited through genes.

            Question.11 Explain the terms:

           <br/>
           <strong>
            (i) Speciation (ii) Natural selection
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           (i) Speciation. The process by which new species develop from the existing species is known as speciation.
           <br/>
           The important factors which could lead to the formation of new species are:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Geographical isolation of a population caused by various types of barriers like mountain ranges, rivers, sea etc. The geographical isolation leads to reproductive isolation due to which there is no flow of genes between separated groups of population.
           </li>
           <li>
            Genetic drift caused by drastic changes in the frequencies of particular genes by chance alone.
           </li>
           <li>
            Variations caused in individuals due to natural selection.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (ii) Natural selection. Natural selection is the process of evolution of a species whereby characteristics which help individual organisms to survive and reproduce are passed on to their offsprings and those characteristics which do not help are not passed on.

           <li>
            Homologous organs. Those organs, which have the same basic structure but different functions, are called homologous organs.
            <br/>
            For example: The forelimbs of a man, a lizard, a frog, a bird and a bat have the same basic design of bones but they perform different functions.
            <br/>
            The presence of homologous organs in different animals provides evidence for evolution that they are derived from the same ancestor who has the basic design of the organ on which all the homologous organs are based.
           </li>
           <li>
            Analogous organs. Those organs, which have different basic structure but have similar appearance and perform similar functions are called analogous organs.
            <br/>
            For example: The wings of an insect and a bird have different structures but they perform the same function of flying.
            <br/>
            Analogous organs provide evidence for evolution that the organisms from different ancestors perform similar functions to survive, flourish and keep on evolving in prevailing environment.
           </li>
           <li>
            Fossils. The remains of dead animals or plants that lived in the remote past are known as fossils. The fossils provide evidence for evolution.
            <br/>
            For example: A fossil of a bird called Archaeopteryx looks like a bird but it has many other features found in reptiles. Therefore Archaeopteryx is a connecting link between the reptiles and birds and hence suggests that the birds have evolved from the reptiles.

           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Long sightedness is hypermetropia. Due to this defect, a person is not able to see the nearby objects clearly but can see the distant objects clearly.
           <br/>
           Causes of long-sightedness. It is caused due to the following reasons:
           <br/>
           — Normal increase in the focal length of the eye lens. The lens becomes less convergent.
           <br/>
           — Shortening of the eyeball size.
           <br/>
           Long sightedness can be corrected by using a convex lens of suitable focal length in the spectacles of such a person.
           <br/>
           When a convex lens of suitable power is placed in front of the hypermetropic eye then the diverging rays of light coming from the nearby object are first converged by this convex lens. Due to this, the convex lens forms a virtual image of the nearby object at a point near to the hypermetropic eye. Then the hypermetropic eye can easily focus the image formed ‘ by convex lens on the retina.

           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           (a) Soaps are sodium salts of fatty acids. Fatty acids are a type of carboxylic acids with
           <br/>
           long chain of carbon atoms.
           <br/>
           Soaps are not suitable for washing clothes when the water is hard:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The formation of lather is necessary for removing dirt from clothes during the washing of clothes. Soap does not give lather with hard water as it reacts with the
            <br/>
            calcium and magnesium ions present in hard water to form insoluble precipitates of calcium and magnesium salts of fatty acids.
           </li>
           <li>
            The scum (or precipitate) formed by the action of hard water on soap sticks to the clothes being washed and it interferes with the cleaning ability of soap. This makes the cleaning of clothes difficult.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>

           water. The soap molecules are sodium or potassium salts of long chain carboxylic acids. The acid end of soap dissolves in water while its carbon chain dissolves in the oil. In this way soap molecules form rounded special type of structures called micelles in which one end of the soap molecule is towards the oil droplet while the acid end is towards the water. This forms an emulsion in water. In this way soap micelles help in removing the dirt particles from the surface and this dirt dissolves in water and the surface gets cleaned and washed.

            Answer.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           (a) Fragmentation. It occurs in multicellular organisms with relatively simple body organisation, for example, in spirogyra (an algae plant) and planaria (a simple multicellular animal). The body bracks up on maturation into two or more smaller pieces and each piece then develops into a new individual.
           <br/>
           (b) The process of getting back a full organism from its body parts is called regeneration. The simple animals like hydra and planaria show regeneration.
           <br/>
           Explanation. If the bodu planaria gets cut into a number of pices, then each body pice can regenerate into a complete planaria by growing all the missing parts. The regeneration of an organism from its cut body part occurs by the process of growth and development. The cells of cut body part devide rapidluy to make a ball of cells. The cells then become specilised to from diffrent types of tissues which again from various organs and body parts.

           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           According to Mendel’s view of dominant trait, the traits of an organism are determined by internal factors which occur in pairs. Out of two contrasting traits only one expresses itself in an individual. This trait is called dominant, while the other which has not shown its effect in the presence of dominant trait is called recessive.

            Question.4 What makes the earth’s atmosphere a heterogeneous mixture?
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Density of various components of the atmosphere is different. Therefore the earth’s atmosphere is a heterogeneous mixture, for example, the heavier gases like CO
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           and O
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           of the atmosphere occupy the lower level (i.e., near the earth’s surface) of the atmosphere whereas lighter gases like O
           <sub>
            3
           </sub>
           Occupy the higher level of the atmosphere.

           So the components of atmosphere are not equally distributed.

           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           (a) The number of valence electrons increases from 1 to 8 on going from left to right in a period. Therefore the first element in every period has 1 valence electron and the last element in every period has 8 valence electrons (except in the first period where last element helium has only 2 valence electrons).
           <br/>
           (b) A ray of light coming from the star travels through earth’s atmosphere. As optical density changes continuously, therefore bending of light takes place continuously. This results in a curved path of light rays due to atmospheric refraction. It appears to the observer as if the ray is coming straight from the source (star). Thus the stars appear higher than their actual positions.

          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            The refractive index of diamond is 2.42. It means that the ratio of the speed of light in air and the speed of light in diamond is equal to 2.42.
            <br/>
            Higher is the refractive of a medium, lower is the speed of light in that medium. Because the refractive index of diamond is very high. Therefore the speed of light in diamond is very low.
