            1. My Neighbour
            <br/>
           </strong>
           Mr. Sheetal Das is my neighbour. He is a businessman. He owns a spacious bungalow and a car. His house is well furnished. It is equipped with all the comforts of life. I am, however, sad to see that he does not have very good relations with his neighbours. Once he called police against one of his neighbours. It happened just because he thought that his neighbour’s children had broken his window glass. The children had of course denied it. He has a servant. This poor boy is not given enough food to eat and I have seen him beating him once or twice. He never donates any money for any cause. I wonder why he behaves in such an ignoble manner. May God grant him wisdom !

            2. My School Library
            <br/>
           </strong>
           My school owns a good library. It has two rooms. One of these rooms is called the reading room. Here, the students sit and study quietly. The other room is bigger. In one of its parts, there are several cupboards full of books. Each cupboard has a special branch of knowledge hidden within the books. I am very fond of the cupboard which contains story books. The library has books suited to students of all age-groups. The library is a great source of pleasure and knowledge. A school without a library is like a kitchen without food.

            3. The Season I Like Most
            <br/>
           </strong>
           My favourite season is the Rainy season. In India it is a very important season. The agriculture in India depends largely on the water given by the rains. For me it is the most colourful of all the seasons. One can see a lot of greenery around oneself. The dark clouds are a great blessing and are eagerly awaited after the scorching summer heat. The best part of the season is that one gets a lot of unexpected holidays and off from the school due to the rains. It is a pleasure to go out in the rains and get wet in the water.

            4. The Night Before The Examination
            <br/>
           </strong>
           Examinations are always fearful. They are a great cause of fear, anxiety, tension and worry. The night before the examination is really painful. The students have no sleep. They stop eating food. They want to read and revise everything. They are disturbed if someone tells them about an important question. They at once study for its answer. They are irritated also if someone disturbs them. They pass the whole night in tension. They do not take anything in the morning. They go to the examination hall on empty stomachs.

           <br/>
           Holi is a festival of fun and colours. It comes at the end of the winter season. Our colony celebrated it as usual. On the Holi day young boys of the colony gathered at a particular spot. They coloured one another’s face and of the passers-by. They also threw water balloons. They went to the nearby colony to put colours on its residents. Soon the women collected. They started throwing coloured water on one another. They offered sweets also. Everybody seemed to be very happy.

            6. Morning Assembly In My School
            <br/>
           </strong>
           Morning Assembly is a very important ritual. It is also a part of the age-old culture of our country.. Every new programme starts with prayers to our gods. So it happens in a school too. Schools are like our temples. Students and teachers stand in rows. They say prayers before starting the day’s work. The scene is very calm and peaceful. All students stand in rows in school uniform. In many schools, some physical training is also given in the morning assembly. Important information is also given to the students by the Principal.

            7. The Scene At A Railway Platform
            <br/>
           </strong>
           The scene at a Railway Platform is always enjoyable. It presents a picture of mini India. Last Sunday I went to the city Railway station to see my uncle off. The platform was overcrowded. Passengers of all states like Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Assam etc, could be seen. There were many stalls on the platform. Small children were running here and there. Coolies in red dress were going to and fro. Passengers were taking tea. Some people were reading newspapers. They were waiting for the train. Soon the train came. My uncle got a seat and the train started. I returned home.

            <br/>
           </strong>
           A visit to a historical place is always educative. Last year I went to Agra. Agra is a historical place. It has many buildings of historical interest. The most famous is Taj Mahal. I have no words to express its beauty. The white marble looks like silver. Its rejlection in the water is simply enchanting. The four minarets add to its glory. The grassy lawns increase it. It looks like a dream in the moon¬lit night. I can’t forget my visit to the Taj Mahal.

           </strong>
           One Day Cricket Matches have become the favourite of cricket lovers. They stop work to enjoy the match. So these one-dayers have become more popular than the test matches. One day match is a one-day game. Time and overs are fixed. Each team plays a maximum of fifty overs. So there is suspense and romance^in this match. It seldom ends in a draw. It gives results. So the players try to win the match. They put in their best. Every ball played is filled with great fun and suspense.

            10. Bad Effects Of Watching Television
            <br/>
           </strong>
           Television has become an essential part of every house. It is the cheapest source of entertainment. Children find it very interesting. But it has bad effects also. Seeing it for long hours harms the eyes. The students Eire left with less time to study. So their studies suffer. Many programmes influence young minds in a wrong way. Foreign programmes are not in good taste. The youth are easily attracted towards them. They forget their own age-old culture. Their lives are spoiled. So television should be watched under the guidance of the elders.
