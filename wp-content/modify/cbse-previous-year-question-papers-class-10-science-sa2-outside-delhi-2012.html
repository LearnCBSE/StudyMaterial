           Three problems that arise due to construction of big dams:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Social problems. Due to the construction of high rise dams, a large number of human settlements are submerged in the water of large reservoir formed by the dam and many people are rendered homeless.
           </li>
           <li>
            Environmental problems. The construction of high rise dams on the rivers contributes to deforestation and loss of biodiversity.
           </li>
           <li>
            Economic problems. Some people believe that the construction of high-rise dams involve the spending of huge amounts of public money without the generation of proportionate benefits.
            <br/>
            Suggestions for these problems. All the people who are displaced from the dam site should be given adequate compensation by the Government for rehabilitation so as to start their life afresh.

           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           When fossil fuels are burnt, the products of combustion are—carbon dioxide, water, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. If combustion takes place in an insufficient supply of air then carbon monoxide is produced. All these products are harmful and create some adverse effects on the environment.

           <li>
            Sulphur dioxide dissolves in rainwater making it acidic. The acid rain thus produced damages trees, plants, buildings and metal structures.

           A homologous series is a group of organic compounds having similar structures and similar chemical properties in which the successive compounds differ by CH

          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            The members of a homologous series show a gradual change in their physical pro¬perties with increase in molecular mass, e.g., as the number of carbon atoms increases, the melting points, boiling points and densities of its members increase gradually.
           </li>
           <li>
            All the compounds of homologous series show similar chemical properties because the basic structure of all the members of a homologous series is similar.

            Answer.
           </strong>
           Na, Mg and AI are the elements of same period where Na is the first, Mg is the second and A1 is the third member.
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Na has the largest atomic radius because on moving from left to right in a period, the atomic radius of elements decreases. As we move from left to right in a period, the atomic number of elements increases and the extra electrons are added to the same
            <br/>
            shell. Due to large positive charge on the nucleus, the electrons are pulled in more close to the nucleus and the size of the atom decreases.
           </li>
           <li>
            Sodium is very reactive, Mg is less reactive whereas Al is still less reactive because on moving from left to right in a period, the chemical reactivity first decreases and then increases.

           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Three different methods of contraception:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Barrier methods. In these methods, physical devices such as condoms, diaphragm and cervical caps are used. These devices prevent the entry of sperm in the female genital tract, thus acting as a barrier between them.
           </li>
           <li>
            Surgical methods. There are surgeries that can be carried out in males and females. In males, a small portion of the sperm duct (vas deferens) is blocked by surgical operation. It prevents the egg to reach the uterus. In both the cases, fertilisation will not take place.
           </li>
           <li>
            Chemical methods. This category of contraceptives acts by changing the hormonal balance of the body so that eggs are not released and fertilisation cannot occur. Females use two types of pills for preventing pregnancies, i.e., oral pills and vaginal pills. The oral pills contain hormones which stop the ovaries from releasing ovum into fallopian tube. This is also called oral contraceptives (OC).
            <br/>
            Other contraceptive devices such as loop or the copper-T are placed in the uterus to prevent pregnancy.

            Question.18 How are fossils formed? Describe, in brief, two methods of determining the age of fossils.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           When organisms (plants or animals) die, their bodies will decompose by the action of micro-organisms in the presence of oxygen, moisture, etc.
           <br/>
           Sometimes in the lack of such conditions (oxygen, moisture, etc.), their body does not decompose completely and is preserved as fossil with the passage of time in the rocks. In many cases the soft parts of the organism get decomposed and hard parts (like bones etc.) become fossil. Sometimes even the soft parts (like leaf etc.) remain preserved as fossils in the form of their impressions inside the rocks.
           <br/>
           Methods to determine the age of fossils:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Relative method. The fossils which we find in layers closer to the surface of the earth are more recent; the fossils which are found in deeper layers are older.
           </li>
           <li>
            Carbon dating. Fossils were once living objects and all living objects contain some carbon-14 atoms which are radio-active. When a living object dies and forms fossil, its carbon-14 radioactivity goes on decreasing gradually. The age of the fossil is found by comparing the carbon-14 radioactivity left in the fossil with the carbon-14 radio¬activity present in the living objects today.

            What are detergents chemically? List two merits and two demerits of using’detergents for cleansing. State the reason for the suitability of detergents for washing, even in the case of water having calcium and magnesium ions.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Detergents are generally ammonium of sulphonate salts of long chain carboxylic acids.
           <br/>
           A detergent is the sodium salt of a long chain benzene sulphonic acid. A common detergent is sodium n-dodecyl benzene sulphonate.
           <br/>
           Detergent can lather well even in hard water because they do not form insoluble calcium water. A detergent works by making the oil and grease particles of dirty clothes dissolve in water through the formation of miscelles.
           <br/>
           Merits of using detergents. Detergents are strong cleansing agents. Detergents form foam even with hard water.
           <br/>
           Demerits of using detergents. Detergents are non-biodegradable.

           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           A basic event in reproduction is the creation of a DNA copy. This is necessary to produce organisms which are similar to their parents. DNA copying is accompanied by the creation of an additional cellular apparatus. When two DNA copies separate, each with its own cellular apparatus by cellular division, so from one cell, two cells are produced. The process of copying of DNA brings some variations each time. Thus the surviving cells are similar to but subtly different from each other. This inbuilt tendency for variation during reproduction brings variations among the individuals of the same species.

            Question.14 “The father is responsible for the sex of a child, not the mother.” Justify this statement.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            A male has one X-chromosome and one Y-chromosome. Thus half the male gametes have
            <br/>
            X-chromosomes and the other half have Y-chromosomes.
           </li>
           <li>
            A female has two X-chromosomes. Thus all female gametes have only X- chromosomes.
           </li>
           <li>
            If a sperm carrying Y-chromosome fertilises an ovum carrying X-chromosome, then the child bom will be a boy.
           </li>
           <li>
            If a sperm carrying X-chromosome fertilises an ovum carrying X-chromosome, then the child bom will be a girl.
            <br/>

            <br/>
            Therefore it is the sperm from the father which determines the sex of the child.

            valence electrons.
           </li>
           <li>
            Group number of an element upto 2 Valance Electrons (VE). is equal to the number of valence electrons and group number of an element having Valance Electrons (VE) more than 2 is equal to (10 + V.E.).

            All the elements of a period of the periodic table have same number of shells.

            Answer.

           During day time the colour of the sky is blue.
           <br/>
           Reason: The molecules of air and other fine particles in the atmosphere have a size smaller than the wavelength of visible light. So these particles scatter more effectively the light
           <br/>
           rays of shorter wavelength at the blue end than light of longer wavelengths at the red end. When the scattered blue light enters our eyes, it gives us the feeling of a blue sky.
