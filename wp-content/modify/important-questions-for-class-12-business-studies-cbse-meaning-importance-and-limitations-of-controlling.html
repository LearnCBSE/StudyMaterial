            9.’Controlling is forward looking’. Explain. (hots; ah India 2009; Delhi 2009)

           <br/>
           <strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           Controlling is forward looking as it must focus attention on two things checking current performance and providing early information to achieve results in confirmity with set standards. Checking on operations should enable prompt detection of faults before it is too late for remedy. Deviations, if any, should lead to investigation of the factors responsible which may effect future operations. Remedial actions should be followed so as to prevent the occurrence of defects thereafter. In other words, control must ensure timely detection of deviations and prevention of their repetition in future.

            10.’Controlling is looking back’. Give a suitable example in support of your answer.(HOTS; Delhi 2008 C)
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           Controlling is called a process of looking back as under it/ actual results are compared with the set standards, decided in the past. After that, a corrective action is initiated. In other words, if the standards are not decided in the past, controlling is not possible. Hence, it is true that controlling is backward looking.
           <br/>
           For example, a salesman is expected to sell 50 units of a product per week. This is the standard against which actual performance would be judged at the end of the week. If he sells 35 units during the week, reasons for shortfall would be ascertained by his superior.

           (i)
           <strong>

           </strong>
           The controlling function measures the performance against the pre-determined standards and corrects deviations.

           A sound controlling system helps the management to verify whether the standards set are accurate and objective. It keeps a careful check on the changes, which are taking place in the organisation and helps in revising standards as and when required.
