           The culture of nuclear families is in fashion. Parents are often heard complaining about the difficulties in bringing up children these days. Too much of freedom in demand, too much independence; over night parties; excessive extravagance, splurging pocket money; no time for studies and family all this is a common cry of such families. Aren’t parents, themselves, responsible for this pitiful state ? The basic need of a growing youth is the family, love, attention and bonding along with moral values. One should not forget that ‘charity begins at home’.

           Independence and individuality both need to be respected, in order to maintain the sanctity of family. Children, today are to be handled with tact in order to bridge the ever widening generation gap. Only the reasonable demands need to be fulfilled, as there are too many expenses to be met and top many social obligations to be taken care of by the parents. Our forefathers lived happily in joint families. Children loved to live with their cousins, learnt to adjust within means. There was perfect harmony between the generations. There never existed the concept of old-age homes. There was deep respect for the family elders and love, care and concern for the youngsters. Even the minor family differences were solved amicably.

           When we enter New York harbour, the first thing we see is the Statue of Liberty. What impresses us the most is its size and magnificence. Have you ever wondered how it came to be there ? The Statue of Liberty was a gift from the people of France to mark the one hundred year anniversary of American Independence. In 1869, sculptor Frederic Auguste Bartholdi began to plan his concept for the monument.
          </p>
          <p>
           Bartholdi chose the look of classic Greek and Roman figures. He envisioned Liberty as a strong and proud figure, one who personified not only the majestic Greek goddesses of the past, but also the working men and women of the present. Finally, in 1884, the work was finished, and Liberty was packed into 214 crates and sent to New York city. Only one problem stood in the way. While the French had raised a lot of funds to build the statue, New York had not secured the funds to build its foundation. It was not until a New York newspaper implored people for donations that money became available. Finally, on 28th October 1886, Americans celebrated the unveiling of the Statue of Liberty.

          <p>
           An elderly carpenter was ready to retire. He told his employer of his plans to leave the house building business and live a more leisurely life with his family. He would miss the pay cheque, but he needed to retire. The employer was sorry to see his good worker go and asked if he could build just one more house as a personal favour. The carpenter said ‘yes’, but in time it was easy to see that his heart was not in his work. He resorted to shoddy workmanship and used inferior material. It was an unfortunate way to end his career.
          </p>
          <p>
           When the carpenter finished his work, his employer handed over the key of the house to the carpenter— “This is your house, my gift to you.”
          </p>
          <p>
           What a shock! What a shame ! If he had only known he was building his own house, he would have done it all so differently! Now he had to live in a poorly built house. So it is with us. We build our lives, a day
          </p>
          <p>
           at a time, often putting less than our best into the building. Then, with a shock, we realize we have to live in the house we have built. If we could do it over, we would do it much differently. But, you cannot go back. You are the carpenter, and every day you hammer a nail, place a board, or erect a wall. Someone once said, your attitude, and the choices you make today, help build the “house” you will live in tomorrow. Therefore, build wisely!

           Next to water, tea is the most commonly consumed beverage in the world. This is a good news because tea offers important health benefits. Its benefits were first discovered by the Chinese Emperor Shen Nung who declared that it gave one vigour of body, contentment of mind and determination of purpose. Today there is ample proof that tea in its many forms possesses a number of health benefits from supporting the immune, system to reducing the risk of cancer, to helping prevent tooth decay.
          </p>
          <p>
           What makes tea such a healthy drink ? The star compounds are called catechins. Those are antioxidants ,      that help prevent cell damage by harmful molecules called free radicals.
          </p>
          <p>
           Tea can be black, green and red and is derived from a warm-weather evergreen tree known as Camelia Sinensis. The more processing, tea leaves undergo, the darker they become. Green tea is the least processed tea. It is simply steamed quickly and offers the maximum healing powers because it isn’t fermented. It also helps prevent tooth decay and aids weight loss.

           Read the following passage carefully:
          </p>
          <p>
           For the mobility—impaired, highly trained canines called ‘service dogs’ can pick up dropped keys, open and close drawers, retrieve prepared meals, help a person in and out of bathtub, dial 911, push and pull wheelchairs, help operate a car or van and pull off gloves, shoes, socks and jackets. Other dogs provide specific assistance to those who suffer seizures (sudden attacks of illness) and require special medication. And, of course, the helping dogs provide companionship, play and give unconditional love to the people they assist.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is thirty odd years now since the placement of the first assistance dog. But only in recent years, with the rising independent movement among disabled people has the idea begun to spread widely.
          </p>
          <p>
           While most service-dogs are trained to work with people who rely on wheelchairs, other categories of helping dogs include hearing-dogs who alert their owners to sounds, such as doorbells, phones, cooking timers, alarm clocks, smoke alarms and seizure dogs which carry medication in their packs and are trained to dial 911 on large keypad phones.

           Read the following passage carefully:
          </p>
          <p>
           An owl is a bird. There are two basic types of owls: typical owls and bam owls. Owls live in almost every country of the world. Owls are mostly nocturnal, meaning they are awake at night. Owls are predators—they hunt the food that they eat. Owls hunt for mice and other small mammals, insects and even fish. Owls are well adapted for hunting. Their soft, fluffy feathers make their flight nearly silent. They have very good hearing which helps them to hunt well in the darkness. The sharp hooked beaks and claws of the owl makes it very easy to tear apart their prey quickly, although owls also eat some prey whole.
          </p>
          <p>
           Owl’s eyes are unusual. Like most predators, both the eyes of the owl face front. The owl cannot move its eyes. Owls are far—sighted, which means they can see very well far away………. but they can’t see dose very well at all. Fortunately, their distant vision is what they use for hunting and they can see far away even in low light. Owls have facial disks around their eyes, tufts of feathers in a circle around each eye. These facial disks are thought to help the Owl’s hearing. Owls can turn their heads 180 degrees. This makes it look like they might be able to turn their heads all the way around, but 180 degrees is all the owl needs to see what’s going on all around its. Perhaps because of the Owl’s mysterious appearance, especially its round eyes and flexible neck, there are a lot of myths and superstitions about owls. Many cultures believe that owls are unusually wise. Because owls are nocturnal, some cultures associate owls with bad omens. The screech of the bam owl is considered by many to sound eerily human, like a person screaming. However, owls probably do not interact with the fates of humans at all. In fact, some owl species may become extinct because of humans.

          </p>

           Be like a flower. One must try to become like a flower: open, frank, equal, generous and kind. So you know what it means ?
          </p>
          <p>
           A flower is open to all that surrounds it: nature, light, the rays of the sun, the wind etc. It exerts a spontaneous influence on all that is around it. It radiates joy and beauty.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is frank. It hides nothing of its beauty and lets its fragrance flow frankly out of itself. What is within and what is in its depths, it lets it come out so that everyone can see it.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is equal: it has no preferences. Everyone can enjoy its beauty and its perfume without rivalry. It is equal and the same for everybody. There is no difference, or anything whatsoever.
          </p>
          <p>
           Then generous without reserve or restriction, it gives away the mysterious beauty and the very own perfume of Nature. It sacrifices itself entirely for our pleasure, even its life it sacrifices to express this beauty and the secret of the things gathered within itself.
          </p>
          <p>
           And then, kind: it has such a tenderness, it is so sweet, so close to us, so loving. Its presence fills us with joy. It is always cheerful and happy.
          </p>
          <p>
           Happy is he who can exchange his qualities with the real qualities of the flowers. Try to cultivate in yourself their refined qualities.

           This is a great lesson for all of us to learn, that in all matters the two extremes are alike. The extreme positive and the extreme negative are always similar. When the vibrations of light are too slow we do not see them, nor do we see them when they are too rapid. So with sound; when very low in pitch we do not hear it, when very high we do not hear it either. Of like nature is the difference between resistance and non-resistance. One man does not resist because he is weak, lazy and cannot; because he will not; the other man knows that he can strike an irresistible blow if he likes; yet he not only does not strike, but blesses his enemies. The one who from weakness resists not commits a sin, and as such cannot receive any benefit from the non-resistance, while the other would commit a sin by offering resistance.
