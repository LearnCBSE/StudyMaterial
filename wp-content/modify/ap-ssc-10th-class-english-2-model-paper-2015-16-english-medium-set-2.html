            Natural Traits
           </strong>
           <br/>
           There was a small village. It had a pit in which a big cobra snake lived. On the occasion of ‘Nagula Chaviti’ – fourth day after the new moon, the people of the village came to the pit to worship the snake.
           <br/>
           The snake observed that while the people worshipped it, they were quite scared too. Children and adults ran away on seeing the snake. The snake was unable to understand that.
           <br/>
           Once a monk was passing by the pit. The snake stopped him and asked, ‘Why do people run away when they see me ?’ The ascetic replied, ‘People are scared of you. If you bite, they will die.’
           <br/>
           ‘How can I stop them from running away from me ?’ asked the cobra.
           <br/>
           ‘If they know that you will not hurt them, then they will not run away from you’, said the wise monk and went on his way.
           <br/>
           After some days, the monk again saw the cobra on his way back. The snake looked weak and was wounded. It looked ill. The monk remembered that earlier the snake looked healthy and had shiny skin. The monk asked the cobra. ‘What happened to you ? Why have you become like this ?’
           <br/>
           ‘I made it clear to the people that I will not bite or harm them. I stopped even hissing at them. Then the people started hitting me with sticks and threw stones at me. I listened to you and see what happened to me.’
           <br/>
           ‘I told you not to bite them but didn’t ask you to stop hissing at them. One should not forget one’s own character traits,’ said the monk and went away.

            16.Read the following passage carefully.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           In some countries we can buy square tomatoes, square cucumbers and even square pineapples ! What are the advantages of growing square fruits ? They are easier to pack ! “If you can get two hundred round tomatoes into a crate, you will get three hundred square ones into the same space,” said a grower. For a long time, scientists have been making experiments to grow better plants, rear better animals and make better food. What will our food be like in the future ?
           <br/>
           We will have boneless fish and fruits without seeds. But most important of all, we will have ‘engineered food’. This is not made from real plants and animals but from things such as wool, hair, petrol, wood and algae ! It may be hard to imagine but now we already have ‘petrol pie’ that tastes like meat. Recently some farmers in America tasted some ‘meat’. They said it was meat but in fact it was made from a mixture of sea-weed and soya flour !
           <br/>
           Some of the ‘engineered food’ may not taste exactly like the real thing. However, it is very much cheaper and contains more food value. For example, man-made meat has more vitamins and proteins than real meat.
           <br/>
           Now answer the following questions.
           <br/>
           <strong>

           Dear Diary,
           <br/>
           I cannot forget today in my life, as I have got a high rank in IIT examination. I feel happy as I am going to reach my future dreams. All my friends, relatives and the members of my family congratulated me for getting a high rank in IIT.
           <br/>
           But I was disappointed when approached my father with my results. My father appreciated me but he expressed his helplessness to afford the expenditure at IIT. He asked me to understand the reality and study as much as I want at Mysore.
           <br/>
           It seemed my dreams has burnt to ashes. But I have to understand the reality and try to prove myself studying at Mysore.
           <br/>
           I hope t will have the blesses of God in fulfilling my dreams.

           <br/>
           Dear Roja,
           <br/>
           I am fine here and I hope the same with you. I have done well in my examination. How about you?
           <br/>
           I think you also know about ‘Swach Bharath’ programme. It was launched by the Prime Minister of India aiming at creating a clean India. You know that India is not a clean country when compared with any developed country. According to some surveys, 75% of health problems are due to unclean surroundings. So if we maintain our surroundings cleanly, we can save people’s health from all common diseases.
           <br/>
           ‘Swach Bharath’ is a good programme. It can improve the health and hygiene of Indian society with this programme. Under this programme, the government is taking care to encourage people to construct lavatories for every house. Cleanliness is next to godliness. If we are able to create a clean India, we can reduce our expenditure on our health. So I would like to suggest you that you should participate in the programme. We also launched this programme in our school and formed a special team of 10 boys to continue the activities. I hope to see a clean India.
           <br/>
           Convey my regards to your parents and your younger brother.
           <br/>

           <br/>
           There was a small village. It had a pit in which a big cobra snake lived. On the occasion of ‘Nagula Chaviti’ – fourth day after the new moon, the people of the village came to the pit to worship the snake.
           <br/>
           The snake observed that while the people worshipped it, they were quite scared too. Children and adults ran away on seeing the snake. The snake was unable to understand that.
           <br/>
           Once a monk was passing by the pit. The snake stopped him and asked, ‘Why do people run away when they see me ?’ The ascetic replied, ‘People are scared of you. If you bite, they will die.’
           <br/>
           ‘How can I stop them from running away from me ?’ asked the cobra.
           <br/>
           ‘If they know that you will not hurt them, then they will not run away from you’, said the wise monk and went on his way.
           <br/>
           After some days, the monk again saw the cobra on his way back. The snake looked weak and was wounded. It looked ill. The monk remembered that earlier the snake looked healthy and had shiny skin. The monk asked the cobra. ‘What happened to you ? Why have you become like this ?’
           <br/>
           ‘I made it clear to the people that I will not bite or harm them. I stopped even hissing at them. Then the people started hitting me with sticks and threw stones at me. I listened to you and see what happened to me.’
           <br/>
           ‘I told you not to bite them but didn’t ask you to stop hissing at them. One should not forget one’s own character traits,’ said the monk and went away.

            16.Read the following passage carefully.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           In some countries we can buy square tomatoes, square cucumbers and even square pineapples ! What are the advantages of growing square fruits ? They are easier to pack ! “If you can get two hundred round tomatoes into a crate, you will get three hundred square ones into the same space,” said a grower. For a long time, scientists have been making experiments to grow better plants, rear better animals and make better food. What will our food be like in the future ?
           <br/>
           We will have boneless fish and fruits without seeds. But most important of all, we will have ‘engineered food’. This is not made from real plants and animals but from things such as wool, hair, petrol, wood and algae ! It may be hard to imagine but now we already have ‘petrol pie’ that tastes like meat. Recently some farmers in America tasted some ‘meat’. They said it was meat but in fact it was made from a mixture of sea-weed and soya flour !
           <br/>
           Some of the ‘engineered food’ may not taste exactly like the real thing. However, it is very much cheaper and contains more food value. For example, man-made meat has more vitamins and proteins than real meat.
           <br/>

           <br/>
