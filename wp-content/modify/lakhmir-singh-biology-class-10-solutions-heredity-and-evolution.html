           </span>
           <br/>
           The characteristics or traits in animals and plants are controlled by genes. For example the transmission of color of hair from the parents to the child. If a mother has black hair and the father has blonde hair and the child has black hair then the transmission of genes for hair colour from the mother and father to the child is as follows: Mother’s cell contains two genes HH for black hair. Both the genes HH are dominant genes, so the mother has black hair. Father’s cell contains two genes (hh) for blonde hair. The two genes hh are recessive genes, so the father has blonde hair. Now, during the process of reproduction, the mother transmits one of the dominant genes H for black hair to the child and the father transmits one of his recessive genes h for blonde hair to the child. Due to this, the child has the genes Hh for her hair. Now the gene H for black hair is the dominant gene but the gene h for blonde hair is the recessive gene. The dominant gene H for black hair shows its effect due to which the child has black hair.

           The sex of a child depends on what happens at fertilisation:
           <br/>
           (a) If a sperm carrying X chromosome fertilises an ovum (or egg) which carries X chromosome, then the child born will be a girl. This is because the child will have XX combination of sex chromosomes.
           <br/>
           (b) If a sperm carrying Y chromosome fertilises an ovum (or egg) which carries X chromosome, then the child born will be a boy. This is because the child will have XY combination of sex chromosomes.

           <br/>
           (a) The differences in the characters among the individual of a species is called variation.
           <br/>
           (b) Human height and free ear lobe are the traits which show variation in humans.
           <br/>
           (c) Due to the creation of variations, a species can adjust to the changing environment around it. And this promotes the survival of the species in the changing environment. Example: The accumulation of ‘heat resistant’ variation (or trait) in some bacteria will ensure its survival even when the temperature in its environment rises too much due to a heat wave or some other reasons. On the other hand, the bacteria which did not have this variation to withstand heat would not survive under these circumstances and die.

           (c) Explain how, characteristics (or traits) are inherited through genes.

             Solution :
            </strong>
           </span>
           <br/>
           (a) Genes are the units of heredity which transfer characteristic from parents to their offspring’s during reproduction. Genes are located on the chromosomes.
           <br/>
           (b) The gene which decides the appearance of an organism even in the presence of an alternative gene is known as dominant gene. The gene which can decide the appearance of an organism only in the presence of another identical gene is called a recessive gene. The dominant gene is represented by a capital letter and the corresponding recessive gene is represented by the corresponding small letter. For example, in pea plants, the dominant gene for tallness is T and the recessive gene for dwarfness is t.
           <br/>
           (c) There is a pair of genes for each characteristic of an organism, one is dominant gene and the other is recessive gene. Each parent passes only one of the two genes of the pair for each characteristic to its progeny through gametes. Thus, the male gamete and the female gamete carry one gene for each characteristic from the gene pairs of the parents. When a male gamete fuses with a female gamete during fertilisation they make a new cell called zygote which grows and develops to form a new organism having characteristics from both the parents which it has inherited through genes.

           (a) How do Mendel’s experiments show that traits may be dominant or recessive ?

           (b) How do Mendel’s experiments show that traits are inherited independently ?

             Solution :
            </strong>
           </span>
           <br/>
           (a) Mendel first crossed pure bred tall pea plants with pure bred dwarf pea plants and found that only tall pea plants were produced in the first generation. No dwarf pea plants were obtained in F1 generation. Mendel concluded that the first generation showed the traits of only one of the parent plants; tallness. The trait of other parent plant, dwarfness, did not show up in the progeny of first generation. Mendel then crossed the tall pea plants of the first generation (F
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           Generation) and found that tall plants and dwarf plants were obtained in the second generation (or F
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           generation) in the ratio of 3:1. Mendel noted that the dwarf trait of the parent pea plant which had seemingly disappeared in the first generation progeny reappeared in the second generation. In this way, Mendel’s experiments with tall and dwarf pea plants showed that the traits may be dominant and recessive.

           <sub>
            1

           generation. When Mendel further crossed the tall pea plants of the F
           <sub>
            1

           generation, he found that the tall plants and dwarf plants were obtained in the ratio 3:1 in the F

            2
           </sub>
           generation were either tall or dwarf. There were no plants with intermediate height (or medium height) in-between the tall and dwarf plants. In this way, Mendel’s experiment showed that the traits (like tallness and dwarfness) are inherited independently. This is because if the traits of tallness and dwarfness had blended (or mixed up), then medium sized pea plants would have been produced.

           <br/>
           A trait of an organism which is ‘not inherited’ but develops in response to the environment is called an acquired trait. Example – If a beetle does not get sufficient food for a considerable time, its weight will be reduced due to starvation. The low weight of the beetle is an example of acquired trait. A trait of an organism which is caused by a change in its genes (DNA) is called an inherited trait. Example – The change of colour from red beetle to green beetle is an example of inherited trait.

           </span>
           <br/>
           For a trait of an organism to be inherited, it should bring about a change in the genes present in the reproductive cells or gametes of that organism. The traits acquired during the life time of a person do not bring about a change in the genes present in its reproductive cells or gametes and hence they are not inherited by the offsprings.

           The wings of a butterfly and the wings of a bat cannot be considered homologous because though the function of wings in both the cases is same but they have different basic design. The butterfly has a fold of membranes as wings which are associated with few muscles but has no bones whereas the wings of bat are supported by bones.

           </span>
           <br/>
           The remains of dead animals or plants that lived in the remote past are known as fossils. The fossils provide evidence of evolution. For example, a fossil bird called Archaeopteryx looks like a bird but it has many features which are found in reptiles. This is because Archaeopteryx has feathered wings like those of birds but teeth and tail like those of reptiles. Therefore, Archaeopteryx is a connecting link between the reptiles and birds and suggests that birds have evolved from reptiles. Thus, fossils provide evidence that the present plants and animals have originated from the previously existing ones through the process of continuous evolution.

           </span>
           <br/>
           The changes in DNA during reproduction are mainly responsible for evolution. The changes which take place in the DNA of species go on accumulating from one generation to the next. So, if the changes in the DNA of any two species are less, then the two species are quite close to one another in evolutionary terms. But if the changes in the DNA of two species are much more, then the two species will be far apart from one another in evolutionary terms. Thus, it is the characteristic of the extent of change in the DNA which is being used to determine how close two species are in evolutionary terms.

           The presence of homologous organs in different animals provides evidence for evolution by telling us that they are derived from the same ancestor who had the ‘basic design’ of the organ on which all the homologous organs are based.

           Sometimes a species may completely die out. It may become extinct. Once a species is extinct, its genes are lost forever, it cannot reemerge at all. The small numbers of surviving tigers are a cause of worry because if they all die out and become extinct, their genes will be lost forever. Our coming generations will not be able to see Tigers at all.

           <br/>
           In evolutionary terms, we can say that bacteria has a ‘better’ body design than spiders, fish, and, chimpanzees. This is because though bacteria is one of the simplest and primitive life forms but it still inhabits and survives in some of the most inhospitable (most unfavourable) habitats such as hot springs, deep-sea thermal vents and ice in Antarctica. Most other organisms (including spider, fish and chimpanzees) cannot survive in such harsh environments.

           <br/>
           Some amount of variations are produced even during asexual reproduction but it is very small. The number of variations produced during sexual reproduction is, however, very large. It is due to these variations that no two human beings look alike. The number of successful variations is maximized by the process of sexual reproduction, so we can conclude that the variation is a necessity for organic evolution. Example: Animal reproduced by sexual reproduction show large number of variations.

           (a) The theory of origin of life on earth was given by J.B.S Haldane. He suggested in 1929 that life must have developed from the simple inorganic molecules (such as methane, ammonia, hydrogen sulphide, etc.) which were present on the earth soon after it was formed. He said that the conditions on earth at that time (including frequent lightning) could have converted simple inorganic molecules into complex organic molecules which were necessary for life. These complex organic molecules must have joined together to form first primitive living organisms. Haldane also suggested from theoretical considerations that life (or living organisms) originated in the sea water.

           Evolution is the sequence of gradual changes that takes place in the primitive organisms over millions of year in which new species are produced. Darwin’s theory of evolution is known as ‘The Theory of Natural Selection’. It can be described as follows:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Within any population there is natural variation. Some individuals have more favourable variations than others.
           </li>
           <li>
            Even though all species produce a large number of offspring’s, populations remain fairly constant naturally.
           </li>

            This is due to the struggle between members of the same species and different species for food, space and mate.
           </li>
           <li>
            The struggle for survival within populations eliminates the unfit individuals. The fit individuals possessing favourable variations survive and reproduce. This is called natural selection.
           </li>
           <li>
            The individuals having favourable variations pass on these variations to their progeny from generation to generation.
           </li>
           <li>
            These variations when accumulated over a long period of time, lead to the origin of a new species.

             Question 36:
            </strong>
           </span>
           <br/>
           (a) Explain the terms ‘analogous organs’ and ‘homologous organs’ with examples.
           <br/>
           (b) In what way are analogous organs evidence for evolution ?
           <br/>
           <span style="color: #eb4924;">
            <strong>
             Solution :
            </strong>
           </span>
           <br/>
           (a) Analogous Organs: Organs which performs similar function but are different in structure and origin. Example – wings of a bird and wings of an insect. Homologous Organ: Organs which have different functions but similar structure and origin. Example – fore arm of frog, lizard, bird and human.
           <br/>
           (b) The presence of analogous organs indicates that even the organisms having organs with different structures can adapt to perform similar functions for their survival under hostile environmental conditions. Thus, the presence of analogous organs in different animals provide evidence for evolution by telling us that though they are not derived from common ancestors, they can still evolve to perform similar functions to survive, flourish and keep on evolving in the prevailing environment.

             Question 37:
            </strong>
           </span>
           <br/>
           (a) Define ‘speciation’. Explain how speciation occurs.
           <br/>
           (b) Will geographical isolation be a major factor in the speciation of a self-pollinating plant species ? Give reason for your answer.
           <br/>
           <span style="color: #eb4924;">
            <strong>
             Solution :
            </strong>
           </span>
           <br/>
           (a) The process by which new species develop from the existing species is known as speciation. New species are formed when the population of same species splits into two separate groups which then get isolated from each other geographically by the barriers such as mountain ranges, rivers or the sea. The geographical isolation of the two groups of population leads to their reproductive isolation due to which no genes are exchanged between them. However, breeding continues within the isolated populations producing more and more generations. Over the generations, the processes of genetic drift (random change in gene frequency), and natural selection operate in different ways in the two isolated groups of population and make them more and more different from each other. After thousands of years, the individuals of these isolated groups of population become so different that they will be incapable of reproducing with each other even if they happen to meet again. We then say that two new species have been formed.
           <br/>
           (b) Geographical isolation will not be a major factor in the speciation of a self pollinating plant because it does not depend on other plants for its process of reproduction to be carried out.

             Question 38:

           </span>
           <br/>
           (a) Define ‘natural selection’.
           <br/>
           (b) “Only variations that confer an advantage to an individual organism will survive in a population”. Do you agree with this statement ? Give reason for your answer.
           <br/>
           <span style="color: #eb4924;">
            <strong>
             Solution :
            </strong>
           </span>
           <br/>
           (a) Natural selection is the process of evolution of a species whereby characteristics which help individual organisms to survive and reproduce are passed on to their offspring, and those characteristics which do not help are not passed on.
           <br/>
           (b) Yes, only those variations that confer advantage to an individual organism will survive in a population. This will become clear from the following example. Suppose there is a population of red beetles in the green bushes and a colour variation arises during reproduction so that one beetle is now green in colour (instead of red). This variation offers advantage of survival because the green beetle can mix up with green bushes, it cannot be spotted and eaten up by a crow and hence its population will increase. If, however, the variation had produced a blue coloured beetle, then this colour could not offer any survival advantage because blue beetle in green bushes could be easily spotted by a crow and eaten by it.
