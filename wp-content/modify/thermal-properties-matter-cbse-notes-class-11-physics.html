           • Heat is the form of energy transferred between two (or more) systems or a system and its surroundings by virtue of temperature difference. The SI unit of heat energy transferred is expressed in joule (J).
           <br/>
           In CGS system, unit of heat is calorie and kilocalorie (kcal).
           <br/>
           1 cal = 4.186 J and 1 kcal = 1000 cal = 4186 J.
           <br/>
           • Temperature of a substance is a physical quantity which measures the degree of hotness or coldness of the substance. The SI unit of temperature is kelvin (K) and °C is a commonly used unit of temperature.
           <br/>
           • A branch of science which deals with the measurement of temperature of a substance is known as thermometry. A device used to measure the temperature of a body is called thermometer.
           <br/>
           • A thermometer calibrated for a temperature scale is used to measure the value of given temperature on that scale. For the measurement of temperature, two fixed reference points are selected. The two convenient fixed reference points are the ice point and the steam point of water at standard pressure, which are known as freezing point and boiling point of water at standard pressure.
           <br/>
           • The two familiar temperature scales are the Fahrenheit temperature scale and the Celsius temperature scale. The ice and steam point have values 32°F and 212°F respectively, on the Fahrenheit scale and 0°C and 100°C on the Celsius scale. On the Fahrenheit scale, there are 180 equal intervals between two reference points, and on the Celsius scale, there are 100.
           <br/>

           • An ideal gas obeys the following law. That is PV = gRT, where P,V and T are the pressure, volume and temperature of the gas respectively, g is the number of moles in an ideal gas and R = 8.31 J mol

           is known as universal gas constant. The equation, PV – gRT is known as ideal gas equation.
           <br/>
           • The absolute minimum temperature for an ideal gas, inferred by extrapolating the straight line P – T graph is found to be – 273.15 °C and is designated as absolute zero. Absolute temperature scale (T) and Celsius scale are related by
           <br/>
           t° C = T – 273.15

            Thermal Expansion
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The increase of size of a body due to the increase in the temperature is called thermal expansion. Three types of expansions can take place in solids viz. linear, superficial and volume expansion,
           <br/>
           (i)
           <strong>
            Linear Expansion:
           </strong>
           The increase in the length of a solid on heating is called linear expansion.
           <br/>
           If the temperature of a rod of original length l is raised by a small amount Δt, its length increases by Δl. Then the linear expansion is given by
           <br/>
           Δl = l ∞ Δt
           <br/>
           where a is the coefficient of linear expansion of the given solid. The unit of α is per degree Celsius (°C
           <sup>
            -1
           </sup>
           ) in the CGS and per kelvin (K
           <sup>
            -1
           </sup>
           ) in the SI system.
           <br/>
           (ii)
           <strong>
            Superficial or Area Expansion:
           </strong>
           The increase in surface area of the solid on heating is called superficial expansion.
           <br/>
           If A
           <sub>
            0

           (l + βt)
           <br/>
           where β is known as the coefficient of superficial expansion. Unit of β is °C
           <sup>
            -1
           </sup>
           or K

           .
           <br/>
           (iii)
           <strong>
            Volume Expansion:
           </strong>
           The increase in volume of the solid on heating is called volume expansion.
           <br/>
           The change in the volume of a solid with a change in temperature Δt is given by Δv = V
           <sub>
            γ
           </sub>
           Δt
           <br/>
           where y is the coefficient of volume expansion.
           <br/>
           • The relation among coefficients of linear expansion (α), superficial expansion (β) and volume expansion (γ) is given as

           β, γ are not constant. Their values depend on the temperature range.
           <br/>
           • Liquids have volume expansion only. If we do not take into account the expansion of solid container, then the expansion of liquid is called apparent expansion. On the other hand, if we take into account the expansion of solid too, it is referred as the real expansion of liquid. It is found that γ

            r

           <sub>
            r

           = real expansion coefficient of liquid, γ

           • Water exhibits an anomalous behaviour. It contracts on heating between 0 °C and 4 °C but expands on heating beyond 4 °C. Thus, specific volume of water is minimum at 4 °C or density of water is maximum at 4 °C. This property of water has an important environmental effect.

            Thermal Stress
           </strong>
           <br/>
           When a rod is held between two fixed supports and its temperature is increased, the fixed supports do not allow the rod to expand, which results in a stress which is called thermal stress.

            Calorimetry
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Calorimetry is concerned with the measurement of heat, the basic apparatus for this purpose being called the calorimeter.
           <br/>
           When two bodies at different temperatures are ‘mixed’, heat ‘flows’ from the body at a higher temperature to the one at a lower temperature, until a common ‘equilibrium’ temperature is reached. Assuming this ‘heat exchange’ to be confined to the two bodies alone (i.e, neglecting any heat loss to the surroundings) we have, from the law of energy conservation:
           <br/>
           Heat gained by one body = heat lost by the other.
           <br/>
           • Transition of matter from one state (solid, liquid and gas) to another is called a change of state.
           <br/>
           • The change of state from solid to liquid is called melting and from liquid to solid is called fusion. It is observed that the temperature remains constant until the entire amount of the solid substance melts i.e., both the solid and liquid states of the substance co-exist in thermal equilibrium during the change of state from solid to liquid.
           <br/>
           • The temperature at which a solid melts is called its melting point. The value of melting point of a solid is characteristic of the substance and depends on pressure also.
           <br/>
           • Melting of ice under increased pressure and refreezing on reducing the pressure is called regelation.
           <br/>
           • The change of state from liquid to vapour (or gas) is called vaporisation. The temperature at which the liquid and vapour states of a substance co-exist is called its boiling point.
           <br/>
           • The change from solid state to vapour state without passing through the liquid state is called sublimation.

           Latent heat of a substance is the amount of heat energy required to change the state of unit mass of the substance from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas/vapour without any change in temperature.

            Heat Transfer

           <br/>
           Heat can be transferred from one place to another by three different methods, namely, conduction, convection and radiation. Conduction usually takes place in solids, convection in liquids and gases, and no medium is required for radiation.
           <br/>
           (i) Conduction: According to Maxwell, conduction is the flow of heat through an unequally heated body from places of higher temperature to those of lower temperature. Rate of heat transfer is given by

           <br/>
           (iii) Radiation: Radiation is the mode of heat transfer in which heat travels directly from one place to another without the agency of any intervening medium.
