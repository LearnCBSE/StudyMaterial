            Question 1.
           </strong>
           On January 01, 2006, a limited company was incorporated with an authorised capital of Rs.40,000 divided into shares of Rs.10 each. It offered to the public for subscription of 3,000 shares payable as follows
           <br/>
           Rs.
           <br/>
           On Application                                                       3 per share
           <br/>
           On Allotment                                                         2 per share
           <br/>
           On First Call (One month after allotment) 2.50 per share
           <br/>
           On Second and Final Call 2.50 per share
           <br/>
           The shares were fully subscribed for by the public and application money duly received on January 15, 2006. The directors made the allotment on February 1, 2006.
           <br/>
           How will you record the share capital transactions in the books of a company if the amounts due has been duly received, and the company maintains the combined account for application and allotment.

            Question 7. Write a brief note on ‘Minimum Subscription’
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer
           </strong>
           When shares are issued to the general public, it is necessary that the minimum subscription amount should be subscribed so that the company can allot shares to the applicants. This minimum amount of share subscription is termed as minimum subscription. As per the Company Act 1956, the minimum subscription of share cannot be less than 90% of the issued amount. If the minimum subscription is not received, the company cannot allot shares to its applicants and it shall immediately refund the entire application amount received to the public.
           <br/>
           e.g., if a company issued 1,00,000 equity share than at least 90,000 share must be subscribed by the public.

           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer
           </strong>
           Share capital of a company can be divided into the following categories
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (i) Authorised Capital
           </strong>
           It refers to that amount which is laid down in clause of the memorandum of association of the company. This i maximum amount with which company is registered and to raise from the public by the issue of shares. The therefore, called the registered or nominal or authorised capital of company.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (ii) Issued Capital
           </strong>
           The authorised capital which is offered to the public for subscription including shares offered to the vendors for subscription other than cash is called the issued capital.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (iii) Subscribed Capital
           </strong>
           It is the portion of issued capital which has been subscribed to by the public i.e., applied for and allotted by the company. Thus, face value of allotted shares is known as subscribed capital.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (iv) Called-up Capital
           </strong>
           The portion of the subscribed capital which the shareholders are called upon to pay is termed as called up capital of the company. The company usually does not require a shareholder to pay in one lot, the full value of the shares he has subscribed for. He is generally required to pay it by instalments. The balance of subscribed capital which has not been called-up represents uncalled capital.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (v) Paid-up Capital
           </strong>
           The amount of called-up capital which has been actually paid by the shareholders is called as paid-up capital and the amounts yet due from the shareholders are called as calls-in-arrears.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            (vi) Reserve Capital
           </strong>
           Sometimes a company by means of special resolution decides that certain portion of its uncalled capital shall not be called-up during its existence and it would be available as an additional security to its creditors in the event of its liquidation. Such a portion of uncalled capital is termed as reserve capital.

            Question 3. What do you mean by the term ‘share? Discuss the type of shares, which can be issued under the Companies Act, 1956 as amended to date.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer
           </strong>
           The capital of a company is divided into a number of equal parts. Each part is called a share. A company may divide its capital into shares of ? 10, ? 50, ^100 or any suitable amount, but it is always preferable to have shares of small denomination in order to bring them within the reach of small investor.
           <br/>
           According to Lord Lindley, “The portion of capital to which each member is entitled to his share”. In this way, share is proportionate part of the share capital and forms ownership in a company.
           <br/>
           According to Companies Act, 1956 there are two types of shares
           <br/>
           (i) Preference Share Preference Share is one which carries the following two rights
           <br/>
           (a) They have a right to receive dividend at a fixed rate before any dividend is paid on the equity shares
           <br/>
           (b) On the winding up of the company, they have right to return of capital before the capital returned on equity shares.
           <br/>
           However, not with standing the above two conditions, a holder of the preference share may have a right to share fully or to a limited extent in the surplus of the company as specified in the Memorandum or Articles* of the company.
           <br/>
           (ii) Equity Share Under Indian Companies Act 1956, ‘an equity share is share which is not preference share’. Thus, this share does not carry any preferential right or in other words, equity share is one which is entitled to dividend and repayment of capital after the claim of preference shares is satisfied. Usually the equity shareholders control the affairs of the company and hence right to all the profits after the preference dividend has been paid.

           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer
           </strong>
           When shares are issued to the public for subscription through the prospectus by well managed and financially strong companies, it may happen that the total number of applications received for shares exceeds the number of shares offered by the company to the public, such situation is called the situation of over-subscription. A company can opt for any of the three alternatives to allot shares in case of over-subscription of shares.

           <strong>
            Question 5. What is a ‘Preference Share’? Describe the different types of preference shares.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer
           </strong>
           Preference share is one which carries the following two rights
           <br/>
           (i) They have a right to receive dividend at a fixed rate before any dividend is paid on the equity shares.
           <br/>
           (iii) On the winding up of the company, they have right to return of capital before of the capital returned on equity shares.
           <br/>
           However, not with standing the above two conditions, a holder of the preference share may have a right to share fully or to a limited extent in the surplus of the company as specified in the Memorandum or Articles of the Company.
           <br/>
           Preference shares can be of various types which are as follows
           <br/>
           (i)
           <strong>
            Cumulative Preference
           </strong>
           Shares If there are no profits in one year and the arrears of dividends are to be carried forward and paid out of the profits of subsequent years, the preference share is said to be cumulative. It is noted that the company should pay dividend out of profits only.
           <br/>
           (ii)
           <strong>
            Non-Cumulative Preference
           </strong>
           Shares If unpaid dividend lapses, the share is said to be non-cumulative preference share. It means when a preference shareholder receives dividend only in case of profit and is not entitled any right to recover the arrears of dividend, then the type of preference shares held by the shareholder is known as non-cumulative preference shares.
           <br/>
           (iii)
           <strong>
            Redeemable Preference
           </strong>
           Shares When shares are repaid after some specified time in accordance with the terms of issue they are called redeemable preference shares.
           <br/>
           (iv)
           <strong>
            Non-Redeemable Preference
           </strong>
           Shares These are the preference shares, which do not carry with them the arrangement regarding redemption. According to Section 80 (54), no company limited by shares shall issue irredeemable preference shares or preference shares redeemable after the expiry of 20 years from the date of issue.
           <br/>
           (v)
           <strong>
            Participating Preference
           </strong>
           Shares When a preference shareholder enjoys the right to participate in the surplus profit (in addition to the fixed rate of dividend) that is left after the payment of dividend to the equity shareholders, the type of shares held by the shareholder is known as participating preference shares.
           <br/>
           (vi)
           <strong>
            Non-Participating Preference
           </strong>
           Shares When a preference shareholder receives only a fixed rate of dividend every year and do not enjoy the additional participation in the surplus profit, then the type of shares held by the shareholder is known as non-participating preference shares.
           <br/>
           (vii)
           <strong>
            Convertible Preference
           </strong>
           Shares These shares give the right to the holder to get them converted into equity shares at their option according to the terms and conditions of their issue.
           <br/>
           (viii)
           <strong>
            Non-Convertible Preference
           </strong>
           Shares When the holder of a preference share has not been conferred the right to get his holding converted into equity share, it is called non-convertible preference shares. Preference shares are non-convertible unless otherwise stated.

           <strong>
            Question 6. Describe the provisions of law relating to ‘Calls-in- Arrears’ and ‘Calls in Advance’
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer
           </strong>
           Calls-in-Arrears The portion of called up capital which is not paid by the shareholder within a specified time is known as calls-in-arrears. In other words, when a shareholder fails to pay the amount due on allotment or any subsequent calls, then it is termed as call-in-arrears.
           <br/>
           The company is authorised by its Article of Association to charge interest at a specified rate on the amount of call-in-arrears from the due date till the date of payment. If the Article of Association is silent in this regard, then Table A shall be applicable that is interest at 5% pa is charged.
           <br/>
           It is deducted from the called-up share capital on the liabilities side of the Company’s Balance Sheet. The company can also forfeit the shares on account of non-payment of the calls money after giving proper notice to shareholders.
           <br/>
           Calls in Advanqe It means calls not due but paid by the shareholder in advance. Thus, the amount of future calls is received in advance by the company.
           <br/>
           In other words, when a shareholder pays the whole amount or a part of the amount in advance, i.e., before the company calls, then it is termed as calls in advance. The company is authorised by its Article of Association to pay interest at the specified rate on call in advance from the date of payment till the date of call made.
           <br/>
           If the Article of Association is silent in this regard, then the Table A shall be applicable that is, interest at 6% pa is provided. It is shown under the heading of current liabilities on the liabilities side of the Company’s Balance Sheet.

           <strong>
            Answer

           When shares are issued to the public for subscription through the prospectus by well managed and financially strong companies, it may happen that the total number of applications received for shares exceeds the number of shares offered by the company to the public, such situation is called the situation of over-subscription. A company can opt for any of the three alternatives to allot shares in case of over-subscription of shares.

          <p>
           Under-Subscription: In case when share are issued by the company and the number of shares applied by the public is lesser than the number of shares issued this is called the situation of under-subscription.
           <br/>
           As per the Comprise Act, the minimum subscription is 90% of the shares issued by the company. This implies that the company can allot shares to the applicants provided if applications for 90% of the issued shares are received. Otherwise, the company should refund the entire application amount received.
           <br/>
           In this regard, necessary journal entry is passed only after receiving and refunding of the application. In this case, normal entries are made as the adjustment is not needed for any excess.

           <br/>
           (ii) If the shareholder does not pay the amount, then the company has the right to forfeit his/her share by passing a resolution.
           <br/>
