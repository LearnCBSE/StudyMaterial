            Ans.
           </strong>
           Pricing of a product is influenced by many factors. Some of them are as follows:
           <br/>
           (i) Pricing objective Firms may include profit maximisation, obtaining market share leadership, surviving in a competitive market and attaining product quality leadership. While deciding upon the price of a product a firm has to see, which of the above mentioned pricing objective, it would consider and fixes the price of its product accordingly.
           <br/>
           (ii) Product cost It includes the cost of procuring, distributing and selling the product. It is important that the price should recover Total Costs (Fixed Costs + Variable Costs) in the long-run including a profit margin over and above the costs.
           <br/>
           (iii) Extent of competition in the market Competition is another important consideration while pricing a product. Under monopoly situation, a firm can enjoy complete freedom in fixing the price of its product. But in case of intense competition, a firm should fix lower price of its product to capture a large market share.
           <br/>
           (iv) Government and legal regulations In order to protect the interest of public against unfair practices, government fixes the price of essential commodities, e.g. medicines, petrol, sugar, etc. A firm should not charge a higher price, otherwise it would invite government action.
           <br/>
           (v) Demand and supply conditions Whether the price of the product should be high or low, depend on the demand and supply conditions.
           <br/>
           (vi) Marketing method use The price of the product also gets affected by the methods of marketing used by a firm to promote the products. If a firm is using intensive advertising to promote the sale of a product then it will charge a higher price for it.
