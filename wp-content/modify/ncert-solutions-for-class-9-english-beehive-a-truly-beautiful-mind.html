           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Explain what the reasons for the following are:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Einstein leaving the school in Munich for good.
           </li>
           <li>
            Einstein wanting to study in Switzerland rather than in Munich.
           </li>
           <li>
            Einstein seeing in Mileva an ally.
           </li>
           <li>
            What do these tell you about Einstein?
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>

          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Einstein left the school in Munich because he did not like the discipline of the school. He hated the school’s regimentation and often clashed with teachers.
           </li>
           <li>
            Albert’s parents moved to Milan and left their son with relatives. After prolonged discussion, Einstein got his wish to continue his education in German – speaking Switzerland. Actually, it was more liberal than Munich.
           </li>
           <li>
            Einstein saw in Mileva Marie an ally against the “Philistines”—those people in his family and at the university with whom he was constantly at odds. He found that she was a “clever creature”.
           </li>
           <li>
            These tell that Einstein was a genius and had the capabilities to achieve his targets. Moreover, he had his own view of life. He liked freedom too much.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           What did Einstein call his desk drawer at the patent office? Why?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Einstein called his desk drawer at the patent office the “bureau of theoretical physics”. Einstein was actually developing his own ideas in secret and his drawer had all the evidences which could reveal the secret.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Why did Einstein write a letter to Franklin Roosevelt?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           With the emergence of Nazis in Germany,
           <br/>
           Einstein emigrated to the United States. It was the fact that the Nazis had the ability to develop the atomic bomb. It could destroy the whole world. So he warned Franklin D. Roosevelt in his letter.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 6.
           <br/>
           How did Einstein react to the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The atomic bomb devastated the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He was deeply shaken by the extent of the destruction and wrote a public missive to the United Nations.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 7.
           <br/>
           Why does the world remember Einstein as a ‘world citizen’?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The world remembers Einstein as a ‘world citizen’ because he believed in universal peace. When there was the rat race for becoming atomic power, he was worried about the aftermaths of the bomb. He was really a world citizen who was concerned with humanity.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 8.
           <br/>
           Here are some facts from Einstein’s life. Arrange them in chronological order.

          <ul>
           <li>
            Einstein became a gifted amateur violinist, maintaining this skill throughout his life.

           In 1931 Charlie Chaplin invited Albert Einstein, who was visiting Hollywood, to a private screening of his new film, City Lights. As the two men drove into town together, passersby waved and cheered. Chaplin turned to his guest and explained: “The people are applauding you because none of them understands you and applauding me because everybody understands me.”

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Einstein wrote a letter to Franklin Roosevelt when the Nazis were in Germany and he had to migrate
           <br/>
           from there. The discovery of Nuclear fission in Germany made the American physicists upset that the Nazis could use an atom bomb.

           Question 6:
           <strong>
            <br/>
           </strong>
           What is Einstein’s Special Theory of Relativity ?

           Answer:
           <strong>
            <br/>
           </strong>
           According to Einstein’s special theory of relativity, time and distance are not absolute. From this followed the world’s most famous formula which describes the relationship between mass and energy i.e., E = me2.

           <strong>
            <br/>
           </strong>
           Why did Einstein’s play mates call him “Brother Boring” ?

            (Board Term 1,2012, ELI-023)
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Einstein could not mix up with other children. He did not find their games interesting. He often uttered every word twice. He was often teased for his abnormally huge head. And so his friends nicknamed him “Brother Boring.”

           </strong>
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Einstein called his desk drawer at the patent office the “bureau of theoretical physics” because he was working as a technical expert in the patent office in Bern where he was supposed to be assessing other peoples’ inventions.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Albert Einstein was really a scientific genius. He felt at home in Mathematics but he showed keen interest in physics. After graduating from the university in Zurich he started working vigorously. With his university education he was working on relativity. After his graduation, he remained jobless. So, he gave private lessons. In 1902, he secured a job as a technical expert in the patent office in Bera. But he went on developing his own ideas. The world showered on him honors invitations. He was honored with Noble prize in 1921.

            <br/>
           </strong>
           Einstein was an unusual child with no indication of his potential greatness. Comment.
           <strong>
            (Board Term 1,2012, ELI-039)
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Einstein’s head was larger than the usual head. He was called “Brother Boring” because he never mixed up with his classmates. He left school because he was not happy with the strict regimentation. He loved mechanical toys and thought his sister to be a toy. The head master thought him to be stupid and good for nothing and that he would never succeed in life. He also told Einstein’s father that whatever profession he chose would not matter, because “he will never make a success at anything”. This proves that Einstein was an unusual child with no indication of his potential greatness.

            <br/>
           </strong>
           What was the outcome of Einstein’s letter which he wrote to the American President, Roosevelt ? Did his warning have any impact on America ?
           <strong>
            (Board Term 1,2012, ELI-051)
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           On his colleague’s insistence, Einstein wrote a letter to the American President, Roosevelt when the Nazis were in Germany and he had to migrate from there. The discovery of Nuclear fission in Germany made the American physicists upset that the Nazis could use the bomb. He warned him of the consequences of the atomic bomb. His words had a great impact. The Americans developed the atomic bomb secretly. They dropped it on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki irf August 1945. Einstein was greatly moved by the destruction. He wrote a long letter to the United Nations and suggested that there should be a world government. This definitely helped ending the world war.

           Question 1:
           <strong>
            <br/>
           </strong>
           Do you think that in today’s context national boundaries are overcome by global issued ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <strong>
            <br/>
           </strong>
           The world is undoubtedly a global village. Any issue cannot be resolved at the national level alone. This has been reflected in die case of Albert Einstein. He wrote to the President of the U.S.A. about the evils of a nuclear war, requesting him to take some measures. It is definitely the responsibility of each one of us to shoulder the responsibility of protecting the world.
