           This chapter introduces the student to a wide variety of flora and fauna present in nature. It starts off with asking the question, “what is living?” and then proceeds to talk about taxonomic categories and aids. Students are familiarised to the very important topic of genus and species classification. They are led into the beautiful world of living organisms and get to discover previously unknown things about their habitat and living habits. They are also taught about biodiversity and why conservation of the same is very important. In the present age, this is a value that must be present in all of the youth and this chapter ensures that is inculcated in them.
          </p>

           This chapter introduces the student to the internal structure and functional organisation of plants. Plant tissue can be broadly categorised into meristematic and permanent. Assimilation of food and storage, transportation of water and minerals, etc are the main functions of the plant tissue. They’ll also learn about the composition and types of plant tissue.
          </p>
          <h3>
           Class 11 Biology Chapter 7 Structural Organisation in Animals
          </h3>
          <p>
           The students have already learnt about a multitude of organisms, both unicellular and multicellular. Unlike in unicellular organisms, multicellular organisms have cells organised into tissues that carry out these functions in a well-organised manner.
           <br/>
           The student studies about the morphology and anatomy of Earthworms, Cockroaches and Frogs in detail. This concludes Unit 2, Structural organisation in plants and animals, which has a weightage of 5% in NEET and 12 marks in the final exams.
