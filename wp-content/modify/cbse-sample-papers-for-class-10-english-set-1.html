           Reading Comprehension Through Unseen Passages
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the following text. [10 Marks]
           <br/>
           (1) As a high school student, studying poetry can be a rollercoaster ride. This journey is punctuated by moments of profound appreciation for simpler pieces and intermittent frustration with more complex works. Let’s be real here – some poems are just plain confusing and no amount of re-reading seems to help decipher the intended meaning. The puzzlement that results from such instances can be both vexing and demotivating. If solving a riddle is what was intended, then playing Sudoku is a better option. One is led to ponder if obscurity was the goal.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           (2) Conversely, some pieces resonate with the reader’s soul, stirring feelings of warmth, happiness, and connection to the world. Often, these compositions center on themes that are universally understood, such as love, nature, or faith. Being able to understand what the poet is trying to say can feel like a little victory and is a welcome relief after grappling with more perplexing poetry.
          </p>
          <p>
           (3) Then some poems are emotionally charged; the ones that make the reader curl up in a ball and cry or jump up and down with joy. One is left in awe of the poet’s ability to convey emotion through words. Let’s not forget the downright weird poems. These are the ones that defy categorization and leave the reader to their own devices in attempting to interpret meaning. The author’s use of figurative language and unconventional imagery can create a sense of bewilderment that is either intriguing or off-putting. Regardless, the reader can appreciate the uniqueness of the work.
          </p>
          <p>
           (4) Despite the wide range of emotions and reactions that come with studying poetry, it can be a rewarding pursuit. Not only does reading poetry allow one to appreciate the artistic beauty of the written word but also enables one to develop crucial critical thinking and analytical skills. The process of unlocking a poem’s meaning can feel like cracking a code or solving a puzzle but the sense of accomplishment derived from mastering a challenging piece can be deeply gratifying. Finally, impressing an English teacher with a well-analyzed poem can be a source of pride and validation.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           (5) Overall, studying poetry is like a box of mixed chocolates, you never know what you’re going to get. But whether it’s complex, emotional, simple, or just downright weird, there’s always something to be gained from the experience. So, let’s applaud all the poets out there, for making us laugh, cry, scratch our heads, and occasionally feel like a genius.
          </p>
          <p>
           Answer the following questions, based on the passage above.
           <br/>
           (i) Which of the following statements best describes the author’s attitude towards studying poetry? [1]
           <br/>
           (A) Finds poetry to be a frustrating and meaningless endeavor.
           <br/>
           (B) Believes that the emotional rollercoaster of studying poetry is not worth the effort.
           <br/>
           (C) Recognizes the challenges of studying poetry but also acknowledges the rewards it offers.
           <br/>
           (D) Feels that poetry is too obscure and abstract for the average person to appreciate.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (C) Recognizes the challenges of studying poetry but also acknowledges the rewards it offers.
          </p>
          <p>
           Explanation:
           <br/>
           Throughout the initial paragraph, the author acknowledges the difficulties of studying poetry but also notes the emotional resonance and sense of accomplishment that can be derived from analyzing complex works. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) What is the tone of the writer in the given lines from paragraph (1)? Rationalize your response in about 40 words. [2]
           <br/>
           If solving a riddle is what was intended, then playing Sudoku is a better option. One is led to ponder if obscurity was the goal.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The tone – critical
           <br/>
           Rationale – The writer seems to be expressing their skepticism and dissatisfaction with poems that are overly obscure and difficult to understand. The writer suggests that such poems may not be worth the effort and compares them unfavorably to solving a riddle. [Overall, the tone suggests a frustration with poetry that prioritizes obscurity over clarity and meaning.]
          </p>
          <p>
           OR
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           The tone – sarcastic
           <br/>
           The statement “if solving a riddle is what was intended, then playing Sudoku is a better option” suggests that the writer is not impressed with the level of complexity in some poetry. Additionally, the phrase “led to ponder if obscurity was the goal” implies that the writer believes some poets may intentionally make their work difficult to understand, which can be frustrating for readers. [The sarcastic tone in these lines is likely a reflection of the writer’s opinion that poetry should not be needlessly complex and should strive to connect with readers.]
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Complete the sentence appropriately. [1]
           <br/>
           The author’s use of vivid imagery in paragraph (3), such as “curl up in a ball and cry” and “jump up and down with joy”, greatly affects the reader because____________.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           … it creates a powerful emotional impact and enhances the reader’s understanding of the intensity of emotion that can be conveyed through poetry.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) The passage includes some words that are opposites of each other. From the sets (a)-(e) below, identify two sets of antonyms: [1]
           <br/>
           (a) intriguing and off-putting
           <br/>
           (c) appreciate and applaud
           <br/>
           (b) deciphering and interpreting
           <br/>
           (d) simple and challenging
           <br/>
           (e) emotions and feelings
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) intriguing and off-putting
           <br/>
           (d) simple and challenging
          </p>
          <p>
           Explanation:
           <br/>
           They represent opposite concepts, with “simple” meaning easy, uncomplicated, or straightforward, while “challenging” means difficult, demanding, or requiring effort. In the given passage, the author uses both terms to describe different types of poetry that a reader may encounter.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) Complete the sentence appropriately.
           <br/>
           We can say that the author’s tone becomes more neutral and objective when discussing weird poems, compared to other types of poetry because ___________. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           … the author acknowledges that weird poems can be off-putting, but also appreciates their uniqueness and the challenge they present to readers [hence, the author is being neutral and objective with no bias]
          </p>
          <p>
           (vi) Based on the reading of the passage, examine, in about 40 words, how studying poetry can be like exploring a new city. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Just as exploring a new city requires an open mind and a willingness to embrace the unexpected, studying poetry requires an openness to different styles and approaches, and a willingness to be challenged and surprised by what you find.
          </p>
          <p>
           (vii) What is the message conveyed by Hina’s experience, in the following case? [1]
           <br/>
           Hina spends hours trying to analyze a poem for her assignment and finally feels a sense of accomplishment and pride, once she understands.
           <br/>
           (A) Only those with a natural talent for poetry should engage with it.
           <br/>
           (B) Persistence makes studying poetry a rewarding pursuit.
           <br/>
           (C) The study of poetry is guaranteed to impress others.
           <br/>
           (D) The efforts of studying poetry are inversely proportional to the rewards gained.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (B) Persistence makes studying poetry a rewarding pursuit.
          </p>
          <p>
           Explanation:
           <br/>
           Q. is rooted in paragraph (4). Hina’s experience of finally unlocking a poem’s meaning and feeling a sense of accomplishment shows that poetry can be rewarding if one is persistent.
          </p>
          <p>
           (viii) State whether the following lines display an example of a simple/complex / emotionally charged / downright weird, poem. [1]

          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Read the following text. (10)
           <br/>
           1. Reduction in green areas has caused various environmental problems. People squeezed between concrete structures are looking for various ways to meet their longing for green. One of the ways to do so is vertical gardens and green walls. Vertical gardening is a unique method of gardening where plants are grown in a vertical position or upward, rather than in the traditional method of planting them on the ground.
          </p>
          <p>
           2. The purpose of vertical gardens and green walls, which arises from the studies of different disciplines (landscape architects, architects, engineers, etc.), is to close the cold image of concrete and increase its visual value. In these systems, nature and structures are integrated, and thus, urban areas and the desired environment have become intertwined.
          </p>
          <p>
           3. Vertical garden case studies often show that though functionality should be in the foreground when vertical gardens are planned, they are generally made as aesthetic elements in the city’s underpasses and city squares and decorative elements in residences, without seeking functionality.
          </p>
          <p>
           4. Experts support that the visual quality and evaluation of landscape architecture are determined based on the satisfaction of the users. Hence, a survey questionnaire was prepared for residents of varied age groups from of a metropolitan city. The given Table 1, displays these responses.

          </p>
          <p>
           5. The study acknowledged that vertical gardening has the potential to transform urban spaces into green, sustainable areas and further research should explore the impact of vertical gardening on the environment and human well-being.

           (iii) Justify the following, in about 40 words.
           <br/>
           While the survey results suggest that vertical gardens may be effective in improving the quality of life in urban areas, further research and evaluation may be necessary to fully understand their effectiveness and potential drawbacks. (2)
           <br/>
           Answer
           <br/>
           The given sentence is true because the majority of participants agreed that vertical gardens can improve the quality of life, increase air quality, and have a relaxing and calming effect. However, the survey does not provide information on the long-term effectiveness of vertical gardens or their potential impact on other aspects of urban life, such as traffic or community engagement.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) Based on the survey results, which two concerns should a city government, looking to install vertical gardens, address? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A city government looking to install vertical gardens should consider addressing these two concerns
           <br/>
           (a) cost of installation and maintenance [should be reasonable]
           <br/>
           (b) areas of installation should be where driver distraction is less of an issue
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) In Table 1, statement 3, “Vertical gardens increase air quality – indoors and outdoors,” received the most neutral responses from participants, with 51 respondents indicating a neutral stance. State any one inference that can be drawn from this. (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           It can be inferred that the participants did not have a strong opinion or preference regarding the effect of vertical gardens on air quality, which resulted in a neutral response.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A benefit of vertical gardening is that vertical gardens can be installed in small spaces, making them ideal for urban cities with limited space.

           Write a letter to the Editor of a national daily, in about 120 words, suggesting the introduction of an online regional language learning programme managed and run by student councils and language clubs in the city. The programme aims to help residents who have recently relocated to a new region to pick up the local language organically. Share the importance and credibility of such a programme and suggest a feasible way to execute it along with possible activities.

           Subject Suggestion Regarding the Need to Form Ecology Clubs
          </p>
          <p>
           Sir/Ma’am
           <br/>
           This letter is written to express my concern about the environmental degradation in our city and suggest a solution that I believe could help in preserving and conserving nature. I believe that forming Ecology clubs and appointing Eco-minders in our city can aid in this endeavour.
          </p>
          <p>
           Ecology clubs can be run by resident volunteers who may undertake activities such as making bird-houses, planting native trees, water harvesting, and creating compost piles to nurture and protect the local ecosystem. By involving the residents in these activities, we can raise awareness about the importance of presen/ing nature and instill a sense of responsibility towards it.
          </p>
          <p>
           Some of the implications of forming Ecology clubs are reduction of pollution levels, increase in biodiversity, and promotion of sustainable practices. This initiative will enhance the quality of life of the residents by providing them with a green and healthy environment.
          </p>
          <p>
           You are requested to kindly consider this suggestion to ensure better preservation and conservation of nature.

           Subject: Introduction of Online Regional Language Learning Programmes
          </p>
          <p>
           Sir/Ma’am
           <br/>
           As someone who believes that languages can help bridge regional divides and promote unity, I am writing to suggest the introduction of an online regional language learning programme in our city to help the recently relocated residents (of all ages) establish a healthy rapport with the residents and promote mutual understanding.
          </p>
          <p>
           This online programme, organised and run by student councils and language clubs, can help these residents pick up the local language organically. This initiative may be conducted only on weekends for three months, making it feasible for participants to attend without hindering their work or studies. Activities such as language exchange programmes, cultural events and group discussions on the virtual platform can be undertaken to make this programme more engaging.
          </p>
          <p>
           I hope that this letter being published in the columns of your daily shall urge the community to support this programme for its potential, to bring people together, promote language proficiency, and foster a sense of brotherhood.
          </p>

           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Tsering, of class X, is contesting for the post of Junior School Captain, in the upcoming student council elections. Given below is her character traits’ graphic, shared in the public domain, by the school counselor, for the awareness of student voters, at school. [5]
          </p>
          <p>
           <img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 10 English Set 1 with Solutions 1" class="alignnone wp-image-130579" height="378" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learninsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-English-Set-1-with-Solutions-1-1.png" width="683"/>
          </p>
          <p>
           All of Tsering’s peers have been asked to write a paragraph in about 120 words, analyzing these traits, to either support or oppose her candidature. As one of her peers, write this analytical paragraph, by selecting some of the traits that support your analysis.
           <br/>
           <em>
            You may begin like this:
           </em>
           <br/>
           As a responsible student voter, I believe Tsering possesses/does not possess the necessary traits to be a School Captain.
           <br/>

            You may end like this:
           </em>

           For these reasons, I believe she has/does not have the potential to be a good School Captain and I support/oppose her candidature.
          </p>
          <p>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Suggested response:
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
           <strong>
            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
             Supporting Tsering’s candidature
            </span>
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           As a responsible student voter, I believe Tsering possesses the necessary traits to be an excellent School Captain. Her disciplined study routine and hard work ethic indicate her ability to prioritize and manage her time effectively. Tsering is less impulsive but sensitive and focuses on the excellent outcome of tasks assigned to her demonstrating good decision-making skills.
           <br/>
           Additionally, her willingness to help peers in academic and personal difficulties highlights her empathetic and caring nature. Furthermore, Tsering believes in the “One for all and all for one” policy, which is pivotal in fostering a sense of community and promoting inclusivity in the school. While she may be an average academic performer, her positive attitude and desire for appreciation will motivate her in her pursuit of
           <br/>
           excellence. For these reasons, I believe she has the potential to be a good School Captain and I support her candidature.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
             Opposing Tsering’s candidature
            </span>
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           As a responsible student voter, I have reservations about Tsering’s candidature for the School Captain’s position. While she maintains a disciplined study routine, her average academic performance suggests a lack of academic discipline. Additionally, her quest for appreciation may cause her to prioritize recognition over the well-being of the school community. Moreover, Tsering’s sensitivity, while admirable, may hinder her ability to make tough decisions and exercise effective leadership skills. While her willingness to help peers is commendable, it may also distract her from her responsibilities as the School Captain. Finally, Tsering’s focus on the excellent outcome of tasks assigned to her may cause her to overlook the process and teamwork required to achieve those outcomes which are crucial for the school’s smooth functioning. For these reasons, I
           <br/>
           believe she does not have the potential to be a good School Captain and I oppose her candidature.

           A thorough analysis of the itinerary provided by the tour organizing vendor reveals that the tour proposal should be accepted. It is well-planned and includes an array of educational activities for the students. The inclusion of visits to Bhawartal Garden, Bhedaghat Dhuandhar Falls, Marble Rocks Cable car tour, and Rani Durgavati Museum offers an opportunity for the students to learn about nature, history, and art. The tour to Kanha Tiger Reserve adds an element of adventure and allows students to connect with wildlife. The provision ‘ of bottled mineral water, insurance policy, and tour manager’s assistance ensures the safety and well-being of the students. The inclusion of a DJ party adds to the entertainment, enjoyment, and enthusiasm quotient of the tour. The complimentary staff provided for every twenty students further adds to the security of the students. Therefore, the tour proposal for the educational trip should be approved.

          <p>
           A thorough analysis of the itinerary provided by the tour organizing vendor reveals that the tour proposal should be rejected. While the tour includes various educational activities, we have concerns about the safety and well-being of the students. The tour includes a long journey of nearly nine hours from Nagpur Junction to Jabalpur and vice versa. Also, it mentions an early morning departure at 5:30 am to the Kanha Tiger reserve and a late evening arrival back to the hotel, on the last day. Long hours of travel and a hectic schedule may lead to physical exhaustion and hamper the learning experience of the students. Additionally, the inclusion of a DJ party may not be suitable for an educational tour. The tour-organizing vendor has not provided details on the quality of the hotel and the quad-sharing basis may not be comfortable for all students. Hence, considering the well-being of the students, the tour proposal for the educational trip should be rejected.

           Question 6.
           <br/>
           Read the given extracts and answer the questions for ANY ONE of the two, given. 5
           <br/>
           A. The question he tried to answer was simple: What is the purpose of the twelve tiny gold spots on a monarch pupa?
          </p>
          <p>
           “Everyone assumed the spots were just ornamental,” Ebright said. “But Dr Urquhart didn’t believe it.”
          </p>
          <p>
           To find the answer, Ebright and another excellent science student first had to build a device that showed that the spots were producing a hormone necessary for the butterfly’s full development. This project won Ebright first place in the county fair and entry into the International Science and Engineering Fair. There he won third place in zoology. He also got a chance to work during the summer at the entomology laboratory of the Waller Reed Army Institute of Research. (The Milking of a Scientist)
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) State any one inference about Dr Urquhart from the given context. (1)
           <br/>
           “Everyone assumed the spots were just ornamental,” Ebright said. “But Dr Urquhart didn’t believe it.”
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           It can be inferred from the given lines that Dr. Urquhart was a scientist who questioned assumptions.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) State TRUE or FALSE.
           <br/>
           None of the terms (a) – (d) below, can be applied to the question
           <br/>
           What is the purpose of the twelve tiny gold spots on a monarch pupa? (1)
           <br/>
           (a) A hypothesis – a proposed explanation for a phenomenon
           <br/>
           (b) An assumption – something that is taken for granted or assumed to be true without proof
           <br/>
           (c) A premise – a proposition that forms the basis of an argument
           <br/>
           (d) A theory – a well-substantiated explanation for a natural phenomenon
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           True (This statement would not be called a hypothesis, assumption, premise or theory. It is simply a statement of the question that ebright was trying to answer.)
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Ebright’s approach towards finding the purpose of the gold spots on a monarch pupa was highly effective. Elaborate in about 40 words, concerning the extract. (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Ebright’s approach to finding the purpose of the gold spots on a monarch pupa was highly effective. By building a device that showed that the spots were producing a hormone necessary for the butterfly’s full development, he was able to provide evidence that contradicted the prevailing assumption that the spots were purely ornamental. This earned him recognition in science fairs and provided him with opportunities to work at research laboratories.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) Which phrase would correctly substitute ‘a chance’, in the given sentence from the extract?

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The phrase ‘an opportunity’ would correctly substitute ‘a chance’ in the given sentence.

           B. LOMOV: It’s cold… I’m trembling all over, just as if I’d got an examination before me. The great thing is, I must have my mind made up. If I give myself time to think, to hesitate, to talk a lot, to look for an ideal or real love, then I’ll never get married. Brr…It’s cold! Natalya Stepanovna is an excellent housekeeper, not bad-looking, well-educated. What more do I want? But I’m getting a noise in my ears from excitement. (Drinks) And it’s impossible for me not to marry. In the first place, I’m already 35- a critical age, so to speak. In the second place, I ought to lead a quiet and regular life. I suffer from palpitations, I’m excitable and always getting upset; at this very moment my lips are trembling and there’s a twitch in my right eyebrow.

          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Why is it fair to say that Lomov’s tone, when he says “What more do I want?”, is

           uncertain and questioning? Answer in about 40 words. (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           It is fair to say that Lomov’s tone when he says “What more do I want?” is uncertain and questioning because he is trying to convince himself that Natalya Stepanovna is a suitable match for him, but at the same time, he seems to be struggling with doubts and fears. His tone suggests that he is trying to reassure himself that he has made the right decision, but he is not entirely convinced.

           <br/>
           modulating his voice? (1)

           <br/>
           over harbor and city
           <br/>
           on silent haunches
           <br/>
           and then moves on.

           <br/>
           Explanation:
           <br/>

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The word “little” used to describe the fog in the poem suggests the subtle and quiet nature of the fog. The word “little” also evokes a sense of innocence and vulnerability, as if the fog is a harmless creature moving through the city. This contributes to the overall mood and tone of the poem, which is calm and peaceful, with a touch of mystery.

          <p>
           Question 8.
           <br/>
           Answer ANY FOUR of the following five questions, in about 40 – 50 words. (4 × 3 = 12)
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) Justify the opinion that the traditional baker and his bread play a significant role in the cultural and social fabric of Goan society. (Glimpses of India-I) (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The traditional baker and his bread play a significant role in the cultural and social fabric of Goan society.
          </p>
          <p>
           This can be said because the Portuguese introduced their famous loaves of bread to Goa and even after they left, the bread-makers remained and even their age-old furnaces still exist. The baker’s bread was not just a food item, but it was an essential part of Goan cuisine and culture – not just a staple food item but also served as a symbol of social and economic status.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) How does Leslie Norris use vivid imagery and metaphorical language in A Tiger in the Zoo, to effectively depict the confinement and oppression, experienced by the captive tiger? (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Leslie Norris uses vivid imagery and metaphorical language in Tiger in the Zoo’ to effectively depict the confinement and oppression experienced by the captive tiger by the use of the words Vivid stripes’ and ‘pads of velvet quiet’, which creates a powerful image of the tiger’s physical beauty and grace that is restricted within the confines of the cage. The contrast between the tiger’s natural habitat and its captivity is highlighted through the description of its expected behavior in the wild such as ‘sliding through long grass’ and ‘snarling around houses’ and its actual behavior within the cage.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Explain how the description of the devastation caused by the hailstorm reflects the sadness within Lencho, in A Letter to God. (3)
           <br/>
           Refer to the given lines, from the text
           <br/>
           Not a leaf remained on the trees. The corn was destroyed. The flowers were gone from the plants. Lencho’s soul was filled with sadness.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The fact that ‘not a leaf remained on the trees’ and ‘the flowers were gone from the plants’ suggests a sense of emptiness and loss, which mirrors Lencho’s feelings of despair and disappointment. The destruction of the corn, which was the source of his livelihood, is particularly devastating for him. In this way, the description of the devastation caused by the hailstorm reflects the sadness within Lencho.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Kitty was a trusted friend to Anne as she allowed her to express her thoughts and feelings freely without fear of rejection. She provided her with a space to confide in and unburden herself to, serving as a form of therapy for her loneliness and isolation
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) How does Ogden Nash’s The Tale of Custard the Dragon, challenge the notion that individuals should conform to societal expectations? (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Ogden Nash’s The Tale of Custard the Dragon challenges the notion that individuals should conform to societal expectations as it presents Belinda as a brave and independent female character (described as brave as a barrel full of bears, a trait that is stereotypically associated with masculinity), while the male characters (Ink, Blink, Mustard) are portrayed as weaker and less courageous. The actions of Ink, Blink, and Mustard seem motivated by fear of social judgment and ridicule – of being perceived as weak- while Custard is unafraid of crying for a nice safe cage. Thus, the poem promotes the idea that everyone has unique talents and abilities and should be encouraged to pursue their passions and strengths, at their pace, rather than conforming to societal expectations or stereotypes.

            Despite Herriot’s advice to put Tricki on a diet and exercise regimen, Mrs. Pumphrey is unable to say no and abstain from overfeeding the dog – Tricki becomes seriously ill due to his weight and unhealthy habits.
           </li>
           <li>

          </p>

           Or
          </p>
          <p>
           B. You have been chosen to address a student gathering from the neighborhood schools, to speak on the resilience of the human spirit required to transcend discrimination.

           <br/>
           You may begin this way
           <br/>
           Good morning, everyone. Today, I’d like to discuss two pieces of literature that offer a powerful insight into the resilience of the human spirit required to transcend discrimination.
          </p>
          <p>
           You may end this way.
           <br/>
           To conclude, I’d like to say that…
           <br/>
           Thank you
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A. One acknowledges that both parents, Amanda’s mother, and the baby seagull’s mother, wanted to help their child. However, their approaches were very different. The baby seagull’s mother was a parent who wanted to better her child’s life by pushing him out of his comfort zone and encouraging him to learn new skills. She believed that her son is capable of flying, even though he was afraid and tried to motivate him by showing him how much fun it could be.
          </p>
          <p>
           Amanda’s mother, on the contrary, is depicted as a strict and critical figure who is presented as always correcting Amanda’s behavior, from her posture and habits to her academic performance and personal hygiene. While her intentions may be good, her methods are shown to be ineffective and in some cases, harmful.
          </p>
          <p>
           In comparison to Amanda’s mother, the seagull’s mother seems to be more attuned to her child’s needs and abilities. She recognizes that the baby seagull is capable of flying and wants to help him achieve his full potential. In contrast, Amanda’s mother seems to be too focused on correcting her daughter’s flaws and may not be paying enough attention to her strengths and abilities.
          </p>
          <p>
           B. Good morning, everyone. Today, I’d like to discuss two pieces of literature that offer a powerful insight into the resilience of the human spirit required to transcend discrimination. They are ‘Nelson Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom (excerpt)’ and Adrienne Rich’s The Trees.
          </p>
          <p>
           Both Mandela’s excerpt and Rich’s poem address the issue of discrimination. Mandela speaks of how his own experiences of discrimination made him more determined to fight against it. He emphasizes the need to move beyond the divides created by race, gender, and class. Similarly, Rich’s poem acknowledges the discrimination faced by trees, which are often overlooked and undervalued. She argues that these trees deserve to be recognized and appreciated, just as all living beings should be.
          </p>
          <p>
           Despite the challenges faced, both Mandela’s excerpt and Rich’s poem showcase the resilience of the human spirit. Mandela’s perseverance and unwavering determination to fight against discrimination, even in the face of great adversity, inspire us to do the same. Rich’s poem also speaks to the resilience of nature, which continues to thrive even in the face of human neglect and disregard.
          </p>
          <p>
           To conclude, I’d like to say that the common themes are prevalent in both these pieces of literature and they remind us of the strength of the human spirit and the importance of standing up for what we believe in, even when faced with obstacles.
           <br/>
           Thank you

           Question 11
           <br/>
           (A) Imagine that M. Loisel, from The Necklace by Guy de Maupassant, writes a diary entry, exploring the theme of class and social status, and the nature of social mobility, in the context of his own experience. Write this diary entry, as M. Loisel, in about 120 words. [6]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           It’s been a tough the past few years, for my wife, Matilda, and me. As I reflect on our experience, I can’t help but think about the broader societal issues that have contributed to our predicament.
           <br/>
           It’s clear to me now that our society is structured in a way that makes upward mobility difficult, if not impossible. The rich get richer, while the rest of us struggle to make ends meet. We live in a world where social status is determined by the amount of wealth one possesses, rather than by one’s character or virtues.
           <br/>
           This narrow view of success has led many people, including Matilda, to pursue material possessions at the expense of their happiness.
           <br/>
           The loss of the borrowed necklace was a painful lesson for both of us. It reminded us that the pursuit of social status and upward mobility can be a trap, leading people to sacrifice their happiness and well-being in the pursuit of an unattainable dream.
          </p>
          <p>
           OR
          </p>
          <p>
           (B) A character arc is the transformation or development of a character throughout a story and refers to the changes a character undergoes as a result of their experiences, challenges, and interactions with other characters. In light of the above information, trace the character arc of the thief in Ruskin Bond’s The Thief’s Story, in about 120 words. [6]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The thief’s character arc in the story shows a transformation from a career criminal to a person who learns to trust and work hard for a living.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            At the beginning of the story, the thief is portrayed as an experienced criminal who is focused on staying ahead of the law.
           </li>
           <li>
            He is initially attracted to Anil because he believes he can exploit the young man’s trusting nature.
           </li>
           <li>
            As the story progresses, the thief begins to develop a friendship with Anil, who teaches him how to cook, write, and read.
           </li>
           <li>
            This transformation of the thief’s character reaches a climax when he is presented with an opportunity to steal money from Anil, but instead chooses to resist the temptation and considers the consequences of his actions.
           </li>
           <li>
            This is a significant change from the beginning of the story when the thief was only interested in self-gain.
           </li>
           <li>
            Although the thief has not completely abandoned his criminal ways, the fact that he hesitated to jump on the train to escape with the stolen money shows that he has developed a moral conscience.
           </li>
           <li>
            The story implies that the thief has realized that a life of crime is not fulfilling and that he is now open to exploring new opportunities for a better life.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           [It can also be observed that the thief struggles with his moral compass throughout the narrative. At first, he is solely focused on his gain and uses his skills as a thief to achieve this. However, as he begins working for Anil and starts to develop a relationship with him, he becomes conflicted about his intentions to steal from him. Ultimately, he succumbs to his desire for money and steals from Anil, but he also feels guilt and remorse afterward. This internal conflict highlights the thief’s character growth and change throughout the story.]
