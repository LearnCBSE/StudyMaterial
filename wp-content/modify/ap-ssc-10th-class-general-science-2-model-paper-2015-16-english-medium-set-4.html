           <strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           a) Gaseous exchange and preventing water loss from the plants are the main function of stomata. .
           <br/>
           b)If the stomata are closed, there would be no possibility of gaseous exchange. Hence, there will be no photosynthesis and respiration.

           <br/>
           <strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           1) Oxygen is present in dissolved state in water.
           <br/>
           2)Human beings do not have gills like the fish which can extract dissolved oxygen from water and utilise it for breathing.
           <br/>
           3)Moreover as we go deep down in water, the oxygen level starts decreasing.
           <br/>
           4)So a deep sea diver carries an oxygen gas cylinder for breathing when he goes deep under’the sea water.

           </strong>
           .1) Sex determination of the baby depends on the sex chromosome carried by the sperm, as the ovum always carries X chromosome only.
           <br/>
           2)If the sperm with X chromosome fuses with ovum, the baby will have XX condition. So the baby will be a girl.
           <br/>
           3)If the sperm with Y chromosome fuses with ovum, the baby will have XY condition.So the baby will be a boy.                                 ,

           4)So the sperms that come from father decides the sex of the baby.
           <br/>

           1) The prevention of pregnancy in women by preventing fertilisation is called contraception.

           2)Any device or chemical (drug) which prevents pregnancy in woman is called contraceptive.
           <br/>
           3)Physical devices such as condoms and diaphragm (cap) are used. This prevents reaching of sperms to ova for fertilisation.
           <br/>
           4)Chemicals in the form of pills are induced either orally or inserting into female reproductive organ vagina.
           <br/>
           5)Pills for males kill the sperms and hence are called spermicide.

           <strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           1) In a terrestrial ecosystem, the biomass progressively decreases from producers to top carnivores.
           <br/>
           2) In the same way, the number of individuals at each tropic level decrease from producers to consumers. Hence, these pyramids are upright.

           <br/>
           2)All the systems of our body are active in function during the daytime of our activity. Hence, man is a diurnal animal.
           <br/>
           3)Our digestive system is also active and ready to receive the food for digestion.
           <br/>

           1)Most of the taste buds on the tongue are killed when the food is hot.
           <br/>
           2)This prevents the person identifying the taste.
           <br/>
           3)The perception of taste decreases when the temperature of the food rises beyond 35°C.

           e)Indiscriminate usage of pesticides and fertilizers should be avoided.
           <br/>
           f)People should follow Rs. 3 principles i.e., Reduce, Reuse and Recycle, the waste products so that we can reduce the soil pollution.
           <br/>
           g)Biological controling of pests, crop rotation and development of genetic resistant strains are the solutions for the control of pesticide pollution.
           <br/>
           h)Reforestation using bio-fertilizers and safe disposal of solid wastes are the best methods to reduce the pollution.

           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           Darwin’s theory of evolution in a nutshell:
           <br/>
           1)The theory of natural selection was proposed by Charles Darwin.
           <br/>
           2)This theory states that nature only selects or decides which organism should survive or perish in nature.
           <br/>
           3)The organisms with useful traits will survive.
           <br/>
           4)The organisms having harmful traits are going to be perished or eliminated from its environment.
           <br/>
           For example we have seen in the case of red beetles which were seen and eaten by crows. So, the population of red beetles gradually got eliminated or perished from its environment. But at the same time the beetles which are green in colour which are present on the green leaves were not noticed by crows. So the green beetles survived in the environment and their population have gradually increased. This is nothing but “natural selection”.

            22.With the help of a diagram show the movement of food from mouth to the stomach. What muscles and nerves are involved in the movement of food and what is this action called ?
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Ans.Muscles involved in movement of food from mouth to stomach :
           </strong>
           <br/>
           1) Typical movement of the oesophagus, stomach and intestine is called peristalsis. The muscles of the mouth enable the food to be pushed in the oral cavity.
           <br/>
           2)The first major muscle movement occurs when food or liquid is swallowed. Once the swallowing begins, it becomes involuntary and proceeds under the control of nerves in the jaw.
           <br/>
           3)Contraction and relaxation of circular and longitudinal muscles in the oesophagus bring in a wave-like motion that propels the bolus into stomach by the action called peristalsis.
           <br/>
           4)As the food approaches the closed ring of pyloric sphincter the surrounding muscles relax and allow the food to pass.
           <br/>
           5)The muscles of the upper part of the stomach have to relax and accept large volumes of swallowed material.
           <br/>
           6)The lower part of the stomach mixes food, liquid and digestive juice by its muscle action.
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Nerves involved in the movement of food :
           </strong>
           <br/>
           1)The fifth cranial nerve has been found to control the movement of muscles in the jaw.
           <br/>
           2)Under the action of autonomous nervous system saliva is secreted to make chewing and swallowing easier.
           <br/>
           3)Peristalsis in oesophagus is also under the control of autonomous nervous system.
           <br/>
           4)When the food is in the oral cavity, the nerves in the cheek and tongue are stimulated and carry messages in the form of nerve impulses to the brain.
           <br/>
           5)These messages are transmitted from the brain to the wall of the stomach and stimulate the gastric glands to produce gastric juice.
