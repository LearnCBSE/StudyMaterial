           <br/>
           3. Hence, India took independent stand and got assistance from members of both the blocs.

           The statement is justified to maximum extent to be proved during ‘Sino-Indian Conflict of 1962’ to dent India’s image at home and international level, India had to approach the Americans and the British for military assistance to tide over the issues. The Soviet Union remained neutral during the conflict:
           <br/>
           (i) All the occurrings, created a sense of national humiliation but strengthened a spirit of nationalism also on the other hand.
           <br/>
           (ii) Pt. Nehru was also criticised for his naive assessment of Chinese intentions and lack of military preparedness.
           <br/>
           (iii) Political mood of country began to change, when no-confidence motion against Nehru moved in and debated in Lok-Sabha.
           <br/>
           (iv) ‘Sino-Indian Conflict’ splitted the Communist Party of India in 1964s split fraction formed communist party of India (CPI-M).
           <br/>
           (v) Besides, the war with China alerted Indian leadership to volatile situation in the North east region.
           <br/>
           (vi) Apart from being isolated and extremely underdeveloped, this region posed the challenge of national integration in front of India.

             Answer:
            </strong>
           </span>
           Two Aspects to be Supported:
           <br/>
           1. India always maintained her dignity and image of a peace loving country by taking initiatives to bring about equality and understanding among the nations i.e. India supported to end Korean War in 1953, French rule in China, US role in Vietnam.
           <br/>
           2. India’s initiatives for Non¬alignment are also appreciable for the maintenance of mutual understanding and security. During post cold war era also, NAM had become an effective tool to make the Security Council more effective and democratic.
           <br/>
           Two Aspects to be Changed:
           <br/>
           1. In the course of decade of 1962-72, India faced three wars and its peaceful image played a very limited role.
           <br/>
           2. Conflict with neighbouring countries like China and Pakistan derailed India’s concept of regional co¬operation under SAARC.
           <br/>
           Hence, India must adopt diplomatic and defensive postures in its foreign policy to maintain its independent entity.

           </span>
           (a) India’s Nuclear Policy:
           <br/>
           1. India advocates no first use and reiterates India’s commitment to global verifiable on non-discriminatory nuclear disarmament loading to a nuclear weapon free world.
           <br/>
           2. Pt. Nehru always promoted ’ science and technology to build
           <br/>
           a modern India, i.e. initiated nuclear programme in the late 1940s under the guidance of Homi J. Bhoba.
           <br/>
           3. India was against nuclear weapons, hence pleaded many nuclear disarmament with superpowers.
           <br/>
           4. India always considered NPT as discriminatory and refused to sign on it.
           <br/>
           5. Even India’s first Nuclear Test in May 1974 was termed as a peaceful explosion and India argued to use nuclear power for peaceful purposes only.
           <br/>
           (6) Consensus in Foreign Policy Matters:
           <br/>
           1. Pt. Nehru played a crucial role in the architecture of setting National Agenda for foreign policy.
           <br/>
           2. Both as a Prime Minister and foreign minister he played profound influence in the formulation and implementation of India’s foreign policy from 1946 to 1964.

            </strong>
           </span>
           No, this was not the failure of foreign policy but this was a result of international situation:
           <br/>
           1. The Chinese Invasion 1962:
           <br/>
           (a) Serious conflict arose when China annexed Tibet in 1950 and removed a historical buffer between two nation, and India did not oppose this openly.
           <br/>
           (b) India grew uneasy, when China began to suppress Tibetan Culture.
           <br/>
           (c) Another border dispute arose when China claimed Aksai Chin area and NEFA (much of the state in Arunachal Pradesh) within the Indian territory.
           <br/>
           (id) Despite long term correspondence and discussions, these issues have not been resolved even by top leaders of country.
           <br/>
           (e) Hence, India had to indulge in the conflict.
           <br/>
           2. War with Pakistan:
           <br/>
           (a) A serious armed conflict between two countries began in 1965 with the initiative of Pakistan over Kashmir partition.
           <br/>
           (b) In 1966, the hostilities came to an end with the UN intervention and Tashkent Agreement signed between Indian Prime Minister Lai Bahadur Shastri and Pakistan’s General Ayub Khan.
           <br/>
           (c) The 1965 War added to India’s already difficult economic situation.
           <br/>
           3. Bangladesh War of 1971:
           <br/>
           (a) In 1970, Pakistan faced its biggest crisis in the way for a split verdict i.e. Zulficar Ali Bhutto’s Party emerged as winner in West Pakistan while Awami league led by “Sheikh Mujibur- Rehman” swept through East Pakistan.
           <br/>
           (b) The Bengali population of East Pakistan had voted to protest against discriminatory attitude of West Pakistan, which was not acceptable to West Pakistan rulers.
           <br/>
           (c) In 1971, Pakistani army arrested Sheikh Mujib and unleashed a region of terror on East Pakistan. This started people’s struggle to liberate Bangladesh from Pakistan.
           <br/>
           (d) India had to bear 80 lakh refugees who fled from East Pakistan to take shelter. Hence, India had to extend moral and : material support to the freedom
           <br/>
           struggle in Bangladesh.
           <br/>
           (e) A full scale war between India and Pakistan in December 1971 broke out, when Pakistan attacked on Punjab and Rajasthan to be retaliated an attack from India.
           <br/>

           Bangladesh War 1971:
           <br/>
           (a) In 1970, Pakistan faced its biggest crisis in the way for a split verdict i. e. Zulficar Ali Bhutto’s Party emerged as winner in West Pakistan while Awami League led by ‘Sheikh Mujibur-Rehman’ swept through East Pakistan.
           <br/>
           (b) The Bengali population of East Pakistan had voted to protest against discriminatory attitude of west Pakistan which was not acceptable to west Pakistan rulers.
           <br/>
           (c) In 1971, Pakistani army arrested Sheikh Mujib and unleashed a reign of terror on East Pakistan. This started people’s struggle to liberate Bangladesh from Pakistan.
           <br/>
           (d) India had to bear 80 lakh refugees who fled from East Pakistan to take shelter. Hence, India had to extend moral and material support to the freedom struggle in Bangladesh.
           <br/>
           (e) A full scale war between India and Pakistan in December 1971 broke out, when Pakistan attacked on Punjab and Rajasthan to be retaliated an attack from India. if) Within ten days the Indian army surrounded Dhakan and Pakistan had to surrender with Bangladesh as a free country, India declared a unilateral ceasefire and Shimla Agreement was signed between India and Pakistan in 1972.

           <br/>
           On the above mentioned reference, we may conclude “Yes’. India’s foreign Policy reflects her desire to be an important regional power which was revealed during the Bangladesh war of 1971.

           Foreign policy of any country is the mirror of national interests as in India:
           <br/>
           1. During non-congress government in 1977, Janata Party announced to follow non-alignment genuinely. This implied that the pro-Soviet tilt in foreign policy will be corrected. Since then, all governments took initiatives to restore better relations with China and entered into close ties with the US.
           <br/>
           2. In Post 1990 period the ruling parties were criticised for their pro-US foreign policy. During this period Russia had lost its global pre¬eminence despite it has been India’s good friend. Hence, India’s foreign policy shifted to a more pro-US strategy.
           <br/>
           3. Besides, the contemporary international situation is also more influenced by economic interests than military interests so made an impact on India’s foreign policy
           <br/>
           i. e. Indo-Pakistan relations have witnessed new developments.

           The Sino-Indian conflicts affected the opposition as well. This and the growing rift between China and the Soviet Union created irreconcilable differences within the Communist Party of India (CPI). The pro-USSR faction remained within the CPI and moved towards closer ties with the Congress. The other faction was for sometime closer to China and was against any ties with the Congress. The party split in 1964 and the leaders of the later faction formed the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI-M). In the wake of the China War, many leaders of CPI(M) were arrested for being pro¬China.
