           You must have used the simple past tense and past perfect tense in your answer. Do you know most often, when you use the past perfect, you use it with the (simple) past?

           <strong>
            Did you know
            <br/>
           </strong>
           You would have used the simple present and present perfect tense in your answer. Why?
          </p>
          <p>
           The main use of the simple present tense is to refer to
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            an action that takes place now.
           </li>
           <li>
            routine action/s.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           The present perfect tense is used to refer to an action which has happened in the past but whose effect still remains.
           <br/>
           (eg.) Among the most worrying aspect of climate change is the effect it has on the world’s food supply.

           The Tagore House is rehearsing a skit for the school’s Annual Day Function. I am taking a part in it. It is about the impact of Global Warming. Our teacher is directing it. I am hearing also the background music. At present, he is giving directions for acquiring appropriate facial expressions by the characters. These characters are actually various objects of nature, viz. sun, moon, earth, vegetation, food, human beings, wild animals etc. The rest of the class is witnessing the rehearsal. The teacher is asking some students who are not taking part in it about their reaction to the acting.

           Some verbs, like the ones mentioned above, are not normally used in the continuous (- ing) form. However, we do sometimes use such verbs in the continuous form. Look at the following examples.
          </p>
          <p>
           1. “I can’t concentrate on my work because I’m thinking about that beautiful scene.”
           <br/>
           2. “I think it is beautiful.”
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Which sentence expresses an activity in progress at the moment?
           </li>
           <li>
            Which sentence expresses a decided opinion?
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Answer:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Sentence 1 expresses this activity.
           </li>
           <li>
            Sentence 2 expresses a decided opinion.
           </li>
          </ul>

           Answer:
           <br/>
           Over the years since 1950 the number of children in secondary schools has been increasing noticeably. This is possibly because the Government has been building more schools to provide the education at secondary level. The efforts of the Government in providing health education, a meal a day to the children at schools, sanitary conditions and facilities in hospi¬tals and Primary Health Centres, have borne fruits. The people have become health conscious. That is why, there has been a noticeable fall in the number of children and people dying from malnutrition.
          </p>
          <p>
           The number of homes with running water has been rising sharply since 1985. A large number of people have been getting clean and pure water. This has sharply decreased the cases of water-borne diseases. The number of women working outside homes has been steadily increasing boosting their husbands’ income and rise in their standard of living.

           Used to and Would
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below. Substitute ‘used to’ with ‘would’ wherever appropriate so that the passage reads better.
          </p>
          <p>
           When I was a student, I used to visit the library frequently. The librarian was a kind man and he used to help me select my books. There used to be a small tea shop near the library. After spending a few hours in the reading room of the library, 1 used to go to this tea shop to meet my friends. There used to be an old waiter who kept a corner table reserved for us.
          </p>
          <p>
           Could you replace ‘used to’ with ‘would’ in every instance?
           <br/>
           No. This is because they are used differently.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Read the passage again and complete the sentences below.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>

           <br/>
