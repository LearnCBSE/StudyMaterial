           Accession of Princely States and merger with Indian union was to expand democracy all over the country because princely states never enjoyed their political rights. Indian government central government used force to extend democracy to some extent as this was mandatory to have a uniform base in the country.

           These two statements focus on the agenda of secularism, democracy, sovereignty and freedom. It focuses on the path which will lead to the real development and prosperity of our country. The first statement appeals to me more than the second one because it invokes the countrymen to remain awake, alert and conscious as it is not the end of our struggle. The time to build the nation initiates now.

             Answer:
            </strong>
           </span>
           Reasons for keeping India secular:
           <br/>
           1. All the Muslims did not leave India during participation, some muslims stayed in India as a minority and Jawaharlal Nehru wanted to deal with them in a very civilised and dignified manner.
           <br/>
           2. He advocated security and democratic rights of Muslims as a citizen of India.
           <br/>
           No, these reasons were not only ethical and sentimental, but there were some prudential reasons also as:
           <br/>
           1. India’s secular nature cherished its long term goals and principles
           <br/>
           like socialism, equality, liberty and fraternity.
           <br/>
           2. Secularism stops any single faith to become superior and inferior to those who practicised another religion. Hence it considers all citizens equal irrespective of religious affiliation.

             Answer:
            </strong>
           </span>
           The two major differences between eastern (Bengal) and Western (Punjab) regions can be summed up as follows:
           <br/>
           1. These regions were the muslim majority provinces to be joined. Hence, it was decided that new country Pakistan will comprise two territories i.e. West and East Pakistan.
           <br/>
           2. Secondly, there was a problem of minorities on both sides of border (East and West). Lakhs of Hindus and Sikhs in areas of Pakistan and Muslims on the Indian side of Punjab and Bengal found themselves trapped with no option except to leave their homes.

           </span>
           The State Reorganisation Commission was set up in 1953 by central government to look into the matter of redrawing of boundaries of state:
           <br/>
           1. The commission evolved that states’ boundaries should reflect the boundaries of different languages to accommodate linguistic diversity.
           <br/>
           2. The State Reorganisation Act was passed in 1956 which resulted the creation of 14 states and 6 union territories.
           <br/>
           3. Its most salient recommendation was the formation of linguistic states i.e. to reorganise states on the basis of accommodation of their languages to prepare a uniform base for the nation.

            </strong>
           </span>
           India proved herself through all stages of three challenges at the time of nation building like:

           The process of partition had been started in 1940 when Muslim League Propounded Two Nation Theory. This process involved various problems:
           <br/>
           1. Areas were supposed to be distributed on the basis of religions majority i.e. Muslim majority areas built Pakistani territory and rest stayed with India. It created communal riots in country.
           <br/>
           2. No single belt of muslim majority was the part of British India. They were concentrated in East and West. Hence, it was decided that Pakistan will comprise two territories namely East and West Pakistan separated by long expansion of India territory.
           <br/>
           3. All muslim majority areas did not want to be merged with Pakistan
           <br/>
           i. e. it was opposed in NWFP. But ultimately NW.FP was made to merge with Pakistan.

           India had to face many challenges immediately after she got independence, which can be summed up as follows:
           <br/>
           1. Challenge to Shape a Nation: India was divided among various states at the time of independence. Hence a great challenge arose to unity and integrate country into one bond Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel took upon himself to integrate these states either wilfully or diplomatically to be completed into different stages.
           <br/>
           2. To Establish Democratic Setup: India constituted representative democracy based on parliamentary form of government and it was a great challenge to develop these democratic practices in the nation.
           <br/>
           3. To Ensure Development and Well Being of the Society: Indian polity made herself to achieve welfare goods with the environment of effective economic policies and eradication of poverty and unemployment.

           Integration of princely states possessed many difficulties in front of nation builders:

           <br/>
           Paramountcy over princely states with the end of their rule over India.
           <br/>
           2. British government took the view that all these states were free to join either India or Pakistan or remain independent wilfully. It became a hindrance for unity of nation.
           <br/>
           3. Ruler of Travancore declared the states an independent one.
           <br/>
           4. Nizam of Hyderabad and Bhopal also followed Travancore.
           <br/>
           5. These responses created a possibility of division of country in place of unity and democracy.

           Hyderabad was the largest princely state of India under the rule of Nizam. One of the world’s richest person. Nizam wanted Hyderabad to be an independent state. But the people of Hyderabad were not happy with the rule of Nizam due to his non-democratic practices. Hence, various section of society agitated against him:
           <br/>
           1. The peasants in Telangana region particularly rose voice against him.
           <br/>
           2. Women also joined the movement in large number.
           <br/>
           3. The communist and Hyderabad congress were in the forefront of movement.
           <br/>
           4. Nizam responded by unbashing a Razakars paramilitary force on people.
           <br/>
           5. Ultimately, the central government had to order the army to tackle and in 1948, Indian army moved in control the Nizam’s forces.
           <br/>
           All the above mentioned situations led to an accession of Hyderabad.

           In the initial years it was felt that linguistic states may foster separatism and create pressures on newly founded nation. But India considered democracy and federalism by making a favour to linguistic states only:
           <br/>
           1. Linguistic states enhanced democratic practices.
           <br/>
           2. Linguistic states reduced separatist attitude by accepting the regional linguistic claims of all regions.
           <br/>
           3. Linguistic reorganisation provided a uniform base to the nation and strengthened unity of nation.
           <br/>
           4. Linguistic states promoted the principle of unity in diversity, a distinct feature of nation.

We must give them security and the rights of citizens in a democratic state. If we fail to do so, we shall have a festering sore which will eventually poison the whole body politic and probably destroy it.

           <br/>
           1. Challenge to Shape a Nation: India was divided among various states at the time of independence. Hence a great challenge arose to unify and integrate country into one bond. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel took upon himself to integrate these states either wishfully or diplomatically to be completed into different stages.
           <br/>
           2. To Establish Democratic Set up: India constituted representative democracy based on parliamentary form of government and it was a great challenge to develop these democratic practices in the nation.
           <br/>
           3. To Ensure Development and Well Being of the Society: Indian polity made herself to achieve welfare goals with the evolvement of effective economic policies and eradication of poverty and unemployment.
