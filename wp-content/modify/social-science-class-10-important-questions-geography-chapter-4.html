          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Write four points to stress the importance of agriculture in India. (2013)
           <br/>
           Or, Why is India called an agriculturally important country? Write four supportive arguments.
           <br/>
           Or, ‘Agriculture has been the backbone of the Indian Economy’ Explain the statement by giving reason. (2017 D)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           India is an agricultural country because of the following reasons:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Two-third of its population is engaged in agricultural activities which provide livelihood.
           </li>
           <li>
            Agriculture is a primary activity and produces most of the food and foodgrains that we consume.
           </li>
           <li>
            It produces raw materials for our various industries, e.g., cotton textile and sugar industry.
           </li>
           <li>
            Some agricultural products, like tea, coffee and spices, are exported and earn foreign exchange.
           </li>
           <li>
            The share of agriculture in providing employment and livelihood to the population continued to be as high as 63% in 2001.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Why do farming practices vary in different regions? Give three major reasons.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Three major reasons are:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Physical environment, i.e., relief, soil and climate.
           </li>
           <li>
            Technological know-how.
           </li>
           <li>
            Socio-cultural practices.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Name some industries based on agricultural raw material.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Cotton Textile Industry and Sugar Industry.

          <p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           What factors does primitive subsistence farming depend on?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Factors:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Monsoons
           </li>
           <li>
            Natural fertility of the soil
           </li>
           <li>
            Suitability of other environmental conditions to the crops grown.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Write main characteristics of ‘slash and burn’ agriculture.
           <br/>
           Or, Write main characteristics of Primitive Subsistence Farming.
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            This type of farming is practised in few pockets of India on small patches of land using primitive tools and family/community labour.
           </li>
           <li>
            Farmers clear a patch of land and produce cereals and other food crops to sustain their families.
           </li>
           <li>
            When the soil fertility decreases, the farmers shift and clear a fresh patch of land for cultivation. This type of shifting allows nature to replenish the fertility of the soil through natural processes.
           </li>
           <li>
            Land productivity is low as the farmer does not use fertilisers or other modem inputs.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Question 6.
           <br/>
           Name some primitive tools used in ‘slash and bum’ agriculture.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Tools like hoe, dao and digging sticks.
          </p>

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           What is the most important characteristic of commercial farming?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The main characteristic of commercial farming is the use of higher doses of modern inputs, e.g., high yielding varieties seeds (HYVs), chemical fertilizers and pesticides to increase productivity.
           <br/>
           The degree of commercialisation of agriculture varies from one region to another.

           Question 12.
           <br/>
           Name one type of agriculture which falls in the category of commercial agriculture. Write the main characteristics of this type of agriculture. (2012)
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Write six characteristics of plantation agriculture.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Plantation agriculture is a type of commercial farming.
           <br/>
           Characteristics of plantation agriculture:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            A single type of crop is grown on a large area.
           </li>
           <li>
            Plantation is carried out on large estates using lot of capital intensive units.
           </li>
           <li>
            Lot of migrant labourers work on these estates.
           </li>
           <li>

           Which fibre crop is called as the ‘Golden fibre’? Which is the most important region of its growth and why? Give one major reason why it is losing the market now.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Jute is known as the golden fibre.
           <br/>
           Jute is mainly grown in West Bengal, especially in the Hooghly Basin because there the geographical conditions favour its growth. These conditions are:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            High temperature required during the time of growth.
           </li>
           <li>
            Jute grows well on well-drained fertile soils in the flood plains where soils are renewed every year. Due to its high cost, it is losing market to synthetic fibres and other packing materials particularly to nylon.

           Technological And Institutional Reforms
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 42.
           <br/>
           Give the main reasons which have necessitated agricultural reforms.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Reforms in agriculture are necessary because of the following reasons:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Sustained uses of land without compatible techno-institutional changes have hindered the pace of agricultural development.
           </li>
           <li>
            Most of the farmers still depend on monsoons because large parts of the country still do not have irrigation facilities.
           </li>
           <li>
            Farmers still depend on natural fertility in order to carry on their agriculture, i.e., they lack material resources, e.g., fertilizers, etc.
           </li>
           <li>
            Ours is an agricultural economy and about 63% of people depend on agriculture for employment and livelihood, therefore reforms have to be implemented.
           </li>
           <li>
            For raising the agricultural production and productivity levels to produce sufficient food for the growing population.
           </li>
           <li>
            To overcome environmental, economic and social constraints, agricultural reforms have to be seriously implemented.
           </li>
           <li>
            The declining share in GDP is a matter of serious concern because decline and stagnation in agriculture will lead to decline in other spheres of economy.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Contribution of agriculture is showing a declining trend:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            The share of agriculture in GDP has shown a declining trend since 1951.
           </li>
           <li>
            Yet its share in providing employment and livelihood to the population continued to be as high as 63% in 2001.
           </li>
           <li>
            Although GDP growth rate of the country is increasing, it is not generating sufficient employment opportunities in the country, especially in the field of agriculture.
           </li>
           <li>
            Farmers are dragging away their investment from agriculture because they have to face big challenges from international competition. This has resulted in further downfall in employment in agriculture.
           </li>
           <li>

          <ol>
           <li>
            Reduction in public investment by government in the agricultural sector particularly in areas of irrigation, power, rural roads, market and mechanisation.
           </li>
           <li>
            Subsidy on fertilizers has decreased leading to increase in the cost of production.
           </li>
           <li>
            Reduction in import duties on agricultural products has proved detrimental to agriculture in the country.

           Question 49.
           <br/>
           (a) Give four reasons why Indian farmers should switch over from cereals to high value crops’ cultivation.
           <br/>
           (b) What will be the implication of this change? Name three countries which have successfully done this.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Indian farmers should switch from cereals to high value crops because of the following reasons:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            It will improve their income.
           </li>
           <li>
            It will reduce environmental degradation at the same time.
           </li>
           <li>
            Fruits, medicinal herbs, bio-diesel crops, flowers and vegetables need much less irrigation than rice or sugarcane.
           </li>
           <li>
            India’s wide variety of climates can be harnessed to grow a wide range of high value crops.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (b) Its implications are:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            India has to import food.
           </li>
           <li>
            If we import food while exporting high value crops, our economy will grow.
           </li>
           <li>
            Three countries which have such successful economies are: Chile, Israel and Italy, which export farm products (fruits, wine, olives, speciality seeds) and import food.
           </li>
          </ul>
