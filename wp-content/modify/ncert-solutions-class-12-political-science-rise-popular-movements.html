             Answer:
            </strong>
           </span>
           1. The Chipko movement began in two or three villages of Uttarakhand on refusal of permission to villages to fell ash trees for making agricultural tools and allotted the same land to
           <br/>
           sports manufacturers for commercial uses.
           <br/>
           2. The villagers protested against the practices of logging to be permitted by government.
           <br/>
           3. Villagers used a novel tactic to hug the trees to protect them from being cut down.
           <br/>
           Impact of movement:
           <br/>
           1. It soon spread across many parts of Uttarakhand and larger issues of ecological and economic exploitation were also raised.
           <br/>
           2. Government issued a ban on felling of tress in Himalayan region for fifteen years until green cover was fully restored.
           <br/>
           3. Active participation of women was also a very novel aspect of the movement.
           <br/>
           4. This movement was started with a single issue but became symbol of many such popular movements emerging in different parts of country during 1970s.

             Answer:
            </strong>
           </span>
           1. Anti-arrack movement was the movement of rural women in Andhra Pradesh to protest against alcoholism, mafias and government.
           <br/>
           2. This movement had its roots in “adult literacy drive” where women complained of increased consumption of locally brewed alcohol arrack by men in their families to effect on rural economy also.
           <br/>
           3. Women in Nellore came together in spontaneous local initiatives to protest against arrack and forced the closure of wine shop.
           <br/>
           And this movement spread slowly all over the state
           <br/>
           Issues relating to movements:
           <br/>
           1. The Anti-arrack movement aimed at prohibition on the sale of arrack.
           <br/>
           2. Its demand touched upon larger section of social, economic and political issues which had established a close nexus between crime and politics.
           <br/>
           3. Women openly discussed the issues of domestic violence like dowry, sexual violence etc.
           <br/>
           4. Anti-arrack movement provided a platform to discuss private issues of domestic violence.
          </p>

           <span style="color: #993366;">

             Answer:
            </strong>
           </span>
           Yes, we would consider the Anti¬arrack movement as a part of women’s movement to provide a platform for women to discuss private issues of domestic violence:
           <br/>
           1. This movement focused on issues of sexual violence against women either within family or outside.
           <br/>
           2. Women joined the campaign against dowry and demanded personal and property laws based on gender equality.
           <br/>
           3. These campaigns contributed a great deal in increasing social awareness as well as shifted from legal reforms to open social confrontations.
           <br/>
           4. Consequently, movement demanded equal representation to women in politics during the nineties. Hence 73rd and 74th amendments granted reservations to women in local level political offices.
           <br/>
           5. Thus, it can be concluded to be a part of women’s movement.

             Answer:
            </strong>
           </span>
           Narmada Bachao Aandolan was a collective local organisation’s movement to save river Narmada which opposed the construction of multi-purpose dam „ “The Narmada Sagar Project” and questioned the ongoing developmental projects in country:
           <br/>
           1. Narmada Bachao Aandolan linked its opposition to Sardar Sarovar Project with larger issues concerning the nature of ongoing developmental projects, efficiency of model of development that the country followed and about what constituted public interest in a democracy.
           <br/>
           2. It demanded that there should be a cost benefit analysis of the major developmental projects due to construction of dam submerged around 245 villages to require two and a half lakh population to be relocated.
           <br/>
           3. The movement demanded proper rehabilitation of all those to be effected from the construction of these projects.
           <br/>
           4. This movement also questioned the nature of decision making process to be in framing of mega scale development projects.
           <br/>
           5. Movement also insisted that local communities must have a say in such decision making alongwith an effective control over natural resources.
           <br/>
           6. Hence, NBA achieved a comprehensive National Rehabilitation Policy formed by government in 2003.

           <br/>
           1. Collective actions, rallies, strikes, disrupt the functioning of a democracy and create a delay in decision making.
           <br/>
           2. Routine functioning of democracy did not have enough space for the voices of these social groups.
           <br/>
           3. It is possible to ignore demand of these movements with the presentation to be represented by one section of society only.
           <br/>
           4. Political parties do not seem to be taking up issues of marginal social groups.
           <br/>
           5. The relationship between popular movements and political parties has grown weaker over the years creating a vacuum in politics.
           <br/>
           Hence, we may conclude that movements are not only about collective assertions or rallies or protest, but they also involve a gradual process of coming together of people with similar problems, demand and expectations.

           Dalit Panthers was a militant organisation of Dalit Youth to be formed in 1972 in Maharashtra:
           <br/>
           1. These groups mainly fought against the perpetual caste based inequalities and material injustices that Dalits faced in spite of constitutional guarantees of equality and justice.
           <br/>
           2. Dalits faced collective atrocities over minor symbolic issues of caste pride. Hence, they demanded effective implementation of reservations and other such policies of social justice.

           </span>
           (i) The Chipko Movement started in early 1973 in the state that is now Uttarakhand. The movement was unique in the sense that it presented a very unusual form of collective action in which men and women from a village of this state were engaged. These villagers protested against the practices of commercial logging that the government had permitted. They used a novel tactic for their protest— that of hugging the trees to prevent them from being cut down. The struggle soon spread across many parts of the Uttarakhand region.
           <br/>
           (ii) Women’s active participation in the Chipko agitation was a very novel aspect of the movement. The forest contractors of the region usually doubled up as suppliers of alcohol to men. Women held sustained agitations against the habit of alcoholism and broadened the agenda of the movement to cover other social issues. The movement achieved a victory when the government issued a ban on felling of trees in the Himalayan region for fifteen years, until the green cover was fully restored.

           Popular movements are the movements organised by dalits and farmers under the banner of various social organisations to voice their demands.
           <br/>
           Women in Nellore came together in spontaneous local initiatives to protest against arrack and forced the closure of wine shops.
           <br/>
           And this movement spread slowly all over the state.
           <br/>
           Issues relating to movements:
           <br/>
           1. The Anti-Arrack movement aimed at prohibition on the sale of arrack.
           <br/>
           2. Its demand touched upon larger section of social, economic and political issues which had established a close nexus between crime and politics.
           <br/>
           3. Women openly discussed the issue of domestic violence like dowry, sexual violence etc.
           <br/>
           4. Anti-Arrack movement provided a platform to discuss private issues of domestic violence.

           The ‘Right to Information Act’ is a law to empower the people to find out happenings in government and act as a watchdog of democracy:
           <br/>
           1. It was passed in October 2005 by Government of India.

           2. This Act ensures its citizens all information about functioning of government machinery.
           <br/>
           3. This right has been expanded to cover various services provided by government i.e., if any purchased product is defective it can be -asked for replacement.
           <br/>
           4. This right gives political actors incentives to good things to help to control corruption.

           Though movements are the result of collective assertions, still these are associated with a “Gradual process of coming together of people” with common intentions, common problem, demands and common expectations. These movements make people aware also by performing educative role towards expansions of democracy.

            Sardar Sarovar Project is a multipurpose mega-scale dam. Its advocates say that it would benefit huge areas of Gujarat and the three adjoining states in terms of availability of drinking water and water for irrigation, generation of electricity and increase in agricultural production. Many more subsidiary benefits like effective flood and drought control in the region were linked to the success of this dam. In the process of construction of the dam 245 villages from these States were expected to get submerged. It required relocation of around two and a half lakh people from these villages. Issues of relocation and proper rehabilitation of the project- affected people were first raised by local activist groups. It wrns around 1988-89 that the issues crystallised under the banner of the NBA – a loose collective of local voluntary organisations.

           Farmers’ agitation is not new in our country. It has been in existence time to time for particular goals. We know that the Indian farmers have been the worst sufferers in the country. They are the backbone of the country in development, yet they are not given much attention. Governments come and go, but the tragedy of our farmers remain the same. Being the leader of the farmers’ agitation I have several demands in my mind for the benefit of the poor farmers but here I would mention only three demands on their behalf:
           <br/>
           (i) Proper banking facilities so that farmers should not depend on the village moneylenders who give them money at a very high rate. Most of the time the poor farmers fall into debt trap which make their life a hell.
           <br/>
           (ii) Proper irrigation facilities in case there is poor/weak monsoon.
           <br/>
           (ii) Insurance of crops will save farmers from committing suicide. The unexpected rain in the months of March and April this year devastated the standing crops in the field. The nature’s fury aggravated the miseries of the farmers some of whom could not bear and committed suicide.

           1. The Chipko movement began in two or three villages of Uttarakhand on refusal of permission to villagers to fell ash trees for making agricultural tools, and allotted the same land to sports manufacturers for commercial uses.
           <br/>
           2. The villagers protested against the practices of logging to be permitted by the government.
           <br/>
           3. Villagers used a novel tactic to hug the trees to protect them from being cut down.
           <br/>
           Impact of movement:
           <br/>
           1. It soon spread across many parts of Uttarakhand and larger issues of ecological and economic exploitation were also raised.
           <br/>
           2. Government issued a ban on felling of trees in Himalayan region for fifteen years until green cover was fully restored.
           <br/>
           3. Active participation of women was also a very novel aspect of the movement.
           <br/>
           4. This movement was started with a single issue but became symbol of many such popular movements emerging in different parts of country during 1970s.
