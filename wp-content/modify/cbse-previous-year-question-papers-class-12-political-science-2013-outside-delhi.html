           Why is the policy of non-alignment of India criticized? Explain any two reasons. [4]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           India has played a significant role in shaping the Non-aligned movement which began as a collective and constructive response of the newly liberated masses of Asia, Africa, Caribbean and Latin America. The movement is responsible for inculcating self-esteem to these newly liberated countries and to a great extent is responsible for the creation of more just and equitable world order. NAM has failed to help promote peace and many of its members have been involved in internal and external violence (for example NAM could not stop or prevent the civil war in Cambodia, or the war between Iran and Iraq). NAM has also been unable to bear on lingering disputes such as the conflict and the problems in Kashmir, causing tensions between Pakistan and India or in Cyprus which is resulting in tensions between Turkey and Greece.

           Explain any four factors which make the European Union a highly influential organization. [4]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Any four factors which make the European Union a highly influential organization:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Its share of world trade is three times larger than that of the U.S.
           </li>
           <li>
            Its military power is the second largest in the world. It is the world’s second most important source of space and communication technology.
           </li>
           <li>
            Its currency Euro poses a threat to the dominance of the U.S. dollar.
           </li>
           <li>
            Before 2019, 2 members of Eu-Britain and France were permanent members of UN Security Council. At present, France continues to single-handedly held the steering wheel of power and influence.

           Question 23.
           <br/>
           Explain the hegemony of United States as a hard power.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The bedrock of contemporary US power ‘ lies in the overwhelming superiority of its military power. American military dominance today is both absolute and relative. In absolute terms, the US today has military capabilities that can reach any point on the planet accurately, in real time, thereby crippling the adversary while its own forces are sheltered to the maximum extent possible from the dangers of war. The military dominance of the US is not just based on higher military spending, but on a qualitative gap, a technological chasm that no other power can at present conceivably span. There are five commands of US military and these are not limited to the area of the United States only. In fact, it extends to include the whole world. This clearly shows the US Hegemony as a Hard Power.

           Question 24.
           <br/>
           Describe India’s relation with China from Independence to 1962. [4]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           India began its relations with China on a friendly note and signed the Panchsheel treaty based on five principles of peaceful co-existence in 1954. The China invasion of India in 1962 strained the relations, dented India’s image and also that of Nehru and the congress. The war alerted the Indian leadership about the development of isolated regions of North East India. The growing rift between China and Soviet Union resulted in the split of the Communist Party of India and marked the formation of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).

           Question 26.
           <br/>
           Explain any four factors responsible for the development of globalization. [4]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Information technology: The Internet has transformed commerce by creating new ways for retailers and their customers to complete transactions. Internet-based communication system made things easier.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) World Trade organization: The World Trade Organization plays a vital role in reducing barriers to trade in services and goods. Globalisation has encouraged countries to negotiate trade agreements but this has been possible only because of the role by World Trade organisation Trade agreements and trade blocs among countries. Countries engaging in trade agreements increase access to foreign markets of their products.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Human migration: Human migration involves physical movement of humans from one area to another. Since World War I, the cost of migration has continued to decline which has made it easier for individuals to travel to other nations. Reasons that people choose to move their families to another country include wars, political conflicts or seeking better employment opportunities. Globalisation as a process is boosted because of this migration.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) Transportation: Transportation is necessary to connect international trade with domestic consumption and production. Improvements in transportation have made it possible to deliver fresh items quickly to other countries, which has made globalisation possible.

           Question 27.
           <br/>
           Who founded the Swatantra Party in 1959? Describe any three policies and programmers of this party. [4]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Swatantra Party was an Indian conservative political party that existed from 1959 to 1974. It was founded by C. Rajagopalachari, the party stood out from other parties in terms of its position on economic issue.
           <br/>
           (i) The party wanted the government to be less involved in controlling the economy. It believed that prosperity could only be achieved through individual freedom.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The Party clearly and openly declared its opposition to “Socialism”: which it described as “State Capitalism”, and its mission was to “Save Freedom”, “Preserve Family Economy”, “Restore Fundamental Rights” and to provide the country “A Democratic Alternative”. “For Farm, Family” and Freedom” became the signature slogan of the Swatantra Party.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) It was critical of the development strategy of the state intervention in the economy, centralized planning, nationalization and the public sector. Instead it favoured expansion of private sector.

           <br/>
           Explain India’s nuclear policy. [4]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           India always considered the NPT as discriminatory and refused to sign it. When India conducted its first nuclear test, it was termed as a peaceful explosion. India argued that it was committed to the policy of using nuclear power only for peaceful purpose. Nehru had always put his faith in science and technology for rapidly building a modern India. A significant component of his industrialisation plans was the nuclear programme initiated in the late 1940s under the guidance of Homi J. Bhabha. India wanted to generate atomic energy for peaceful purposes. Nehru was against nuclear weapons. So he pleaded with the superpowers for comprehensive nuclear disarmament.

           What reasons, do you think, were responsible for the declaration of emergency in 1975? Examine any two reasons. [4]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Two reasons responsible for the declaration of emergency:
           <br/>
           (i) During the period of 1973-75, political unrest against the Indira-led government was at its peak. The Supreme Court found many initiatives of the government unconstitutional. The opposition parties led by Jay Prakash Narayan announced a nationwide Satyagraha for Indira’s resignation on grounds that she had used the services of government servants in her election campaign. This threatened to bring the government activities to a standstill.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) The government cited threats to national security, as a war with Pakistan had recently been concluded and the strikes and protests had hurt the economy of the country. Due to internal threats and disturbances, the government decided to declare an emergency.

           <br/>
           The collapse of communism was followed in most of these countries by a painful process of transition from an authoritarian socialist system to a democratic capitalist system. Privatization of state assets and corporate ownership patterns were to be immediately brought in. [6]

           The two superpowers were keen on expanding their spheres of influence in different parts of
           <br/>
           the world. In a world sharply divided between the two alliance systems, a state was supposed to remain tied to its protective super-power to limit the influence of the other superpower and its allies. Most countries of Western Europe sided with the US and those of Eastern Europe joined the Soviet camp.

           Question 32.
           <br/>
           Explain any three environmental concerns in global politics. [6]
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Explain the concept of globalisation and any two reasons for resistance to it.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The growing focus on environmental issues within the arena of global politics was firmly consolidated at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in June 1992. This was also called the Earth Summit. Major three environmental concerns in global politics are :
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) Throughout the world, cultivable area is barely expanding any more, and a substantial portion of existing agricultural land is losing fertility. Grasslands have been over-grazed and fisheries over-harvested. Water bodies have suffered extensive depletion and pollution, severely restricting food production.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Natural forests which help stabilize the climate, moderate water supplies, and harbour a majority of the planet’s biodiversity on land are being cut down and people are being displaced. The loss of biodiversity continues due to the destruction of habitat in areas which are rich in species.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) A steady decline in the total amount of ozone in the Earth’s stratosphere (commonly referred to as the ozone hole) poses a real danger to ecosystems and human health. Certain gases like Carbon dioxide, Methane, Hydro-fluoro carbons etc. are considered at least partly responsible for global warming — the rise in global temperature which may have catastrophic consequences for life on Earth.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Resistance to globalisation:
           <br/>
           The worldwide movement toward economic, financial, trade, and communicational integration is Globalisation. In fact it is the process of international integration arising from the interchange of world views, products, ideas, and other aspects of life. It is not always positive; it can have negative consequences for the people. Globalization need not be only about the economic issues, nor is the direction of influence always from the rich to the poor countries.
          </p>
          <p>
           All over the world, the old ‘welfare state’ is now giving way to a more minimalist state that performs certain core functions such as the maintenance of law and order and the security of its citizens. However, it withdraws from many of its earlier welfare functions directed at economic and social well-being. In place of the welfare state, it is the market that becomes the prime determinant of economic and social priorities.
          </p>
          <p>
           Economic globalisation usually involves greater economic flows among different countries of the world. Some of this is voluntary and some forced by international institutions andpowerfulcountri.es. This flow or exchange can take various forms: commodities, capital, people and ideas. Globalization has involved greater trade in commodities across the globe.
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) Those on the left argue that contemporary globalisation represents a particular phase of global capitalism that makes the rich richer and the poor poorer. Weakening of the state leads to a reduction in the capacity of the state to protect the interest of the poor, and thus is why globalisation should be resisted.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Critics of globalisation from the political weight express anxiety over political, economic and cultural effects. Politically, they fear the weakening of the state; economically, they want to return to self-reliance and protectionism, at least in certain areas of economy culturally, they are worried that t traditional culture will be harmed and people will lose their age-old values and ways.

           “Congress had remained a social and ideological, coalition for a long period.” Justify the statement. [6]

           OR
           <br/>
           Access the outcome of early phase of planned development in India.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Congress Party evolved from its origins in 1885 as a pressure group for the newly educated, professional and commercial classes to a mass movement in the twentieth century. This laid the basis for its eventual transformation into a mass political party and its subsequent domination of the political system. Thus the Congress began as a party dominated by the English speaking, upper caste, upper middle-class and urban elite. But with every Civil Disobedience Movement, it launched, its social base widened. Peasants and industrialists, urban dwellers and villagers, workers and owners, middle, lower and upper classes and castes, all found space in the Congress. Gradually, its leadership also expanded beyond the upper caste and upper class professionals to agriculture based leaders with a rural orientation.
          </p>
          <p>
           By the time of Independence, the Congress was transformed into a rainbow like social coalition broadly representing India’s diversity in terms of classes and castes, religions and languages and various interests. In this sense the Congress was an ideological coalition as well. It accommodated the revolutionary and pacifist, conservative and radical, extremist and moderate and the right, left and all shades of the centre. The Congress was a ‘platform’ for numerous groups, interests and even political parties to take part in the national movement.

           OR
           <br/>
           The major outcomes of the three objectives that were identified in Independent India, the third objective proved most difficult to realize. Execution of land reforms did not take place effectively in most parts of the country; political power remained in the hands of the landowning classes; and big, industrialists continued to benefit and thrive while poverty did not reduce much. The early initiatives r for planned development were at best realizing the goals of economic development of the country and well-being of all its citizens. The inability to take ‘ significant steps in this direction in the very first stage was to become a political problem. Those who benefited from unequal development soon became politically powerful and made it even more difficult to move in the desired direction.
          </p>
          <p>
           In this period the foundations of India’s future economic growth were laid. Some of the largest developmental projects in India’s history were undertaken during this period. These included mega-dams like Bhakhra-Nangal and Hirakud for irrigation and power generation. Some of the heavy industries in the public sector—steel plants, oil refineries, manufacturing units, defense production etc. were started during this period. Infrastructure for transport and communication was improved substantially.

           (i) During this period the government made conscious attempts to project socialist credentials. In contrast to the one programme of the opposition of ‘Indira Hatao’, she put forward positive programme captured in the famous slogan ‘Garibi Hatao’.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Indira Gandhi vigourously campaigned for implementing the existing reform laws and undertook further land ceiling legislation.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Not only this, in order to end her dependence on the other political parties and to strengthen her party’s position in the Parliament and seek a popular mandate in her programmes, Indira Gandhi’s government recommended the dissolution of the Lok Sabha in December 1970.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) The crisis in East Pakistan and the Indo-Pak war leading to the establishment of Bangladesh added one more feather to the popularity of Indira Gandhi.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) In this way, Indira Gandhi and her government was seen not only as protector of the poor and the underprivileged but also as a strong government.
          </p>
          <p>
           (vi) Indira Gandhi through her positive programme—Garibi Hatao, focused on the growth of the public sector, removal of disparities in income and opportunities and the abolition of princely privileges.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           (i) The elections came after the end of the Emergency that Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had imposed in 1975; it effectively suspended democracy, suppressed the opposition, and took control of the media with authoritarian measures. The opposition called for a restoration of democracy and Indians saw the election results as a repudiation of the Emergency.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Gandhi had become extremely unpopular for her decision and paid for it during the elections. On 23 January, she called for fresh elections and released all political prisoners.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Four Opposition parties, the Congress (Organization), the Jan Sangh, the Bharatiya Lok Dal and the Socialist Party, decided to fight the elections under a single banner called the Janata alliance. The alliance used the symbol allocated to Bharatiya Lok Dal as their symbol on the ballot papers.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) The Janata alliance reminded voters of the excesses and human rights violations during the Emergency, like compulsory sterilization and imprisonment of political leaders.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) The structural factors allowed voters to express their grievances, notably their resentment of the emergency and its authoritarian and repressive policies.
          </p>
          <p>
           (vi) One grievance often mentioned was the forced ‘Nasbandi’ (vasectomy) campaign in rural areas. The middle class also emphasized on the curbing of freedom of speech throughout the country.

           Question 35.
           <br/>
           What are popular movements? Describe any four benefits of popular movement. [6]
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Highlight any three issues on which a broad agreement has emerged among most of the political parties in India.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A popular movement is a sustained collective action over time. Such action is aimed against the state and takes shape into demand for a change in state policy or practice. Any such collective action is marked by some degree of organizations. Any popular movement must have a social orientation. Thus, it can be said briefly that popular movements often arise with the aim of bringing about changes on a public issue.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            It helps us to understand better the nature of democratic politics.
           </li>
           <li>
            These movements came up to rectify some problems in the functioning of party politics and as integral part of our democratic politics.
           </li>
           <li>
            They represented new social groups where economic and social grievances were not redressed in the realm of electoral politics. Popular movements ensured effective representation of diverse groups and their demands.
           </li>
           <li>
            Popular Movements suggests new forms of active participation and thus broadened the idea of participation in Indian democracy.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           OR
           <br/>
           In the midst of severe competition and many conflicts, a consensus appears to have emerged among most parties:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Agreement or new economic policies. Most parties believe that these policies would lead the country to prosperity and a status of economic power in the world.
           </li>
           <li>
            Acceptance of the political and social claims of the backward classes/castes. As a result, all political parties now support the reservation of seats for the ‘Backward classes” in education and employment.
           </li>
           <li>
            Acceptance of the role of state-level parties in the governance of the country. The distinction between state level and national level parties has reduced considerably.
           </li>
           <li>
            Emphasis on pragmatic considerations rather than ideological positions and political alliances. Coalition politics has shifted the focus of political parties from ideological differences to “Power sharing arrangement”.
           </li>
          </ul>
