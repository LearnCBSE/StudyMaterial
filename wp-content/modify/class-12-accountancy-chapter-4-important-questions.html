          </h2>
          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           What is meant by‘gaining ratio on retirement of a partner (Delhi 2019)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The ratio in which the continuing partners acquire the outgoing partner’s share is called as gaining ratio.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Aman, Yatin and Uma were partners and were sharing profits and losses in the ratio of 5 : 3 : 2. Uma retired and her share was taken over by Aman and Yatin 5 : 3 in ratio. Calculate gaining ratio of Aman and Yatin. (Compartment 2018)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Calculation of Gaining Ratio
           <br/>
           Uma’s share = \(\frac{2}{10}\)
           <br/>
           Aman gams = \(\frac{5}{8} \times \frac{2}{10}=\frac{10}{80}\)
           <br/>
           Yatin gams = \(\frac{3}{8} \times \frac{2}{10}=\frac{6}{80}\)
           <br/>
           Gaining ratio of Aman and Yatin = 10 : 6 = 5 : 3
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           X, Y and Z are partners sharing profits in the ratio of \(\frac{1}{2}\), \(\frac{2}{5}\) and \(\frac{1}{10}\). Find the new ratio of remaining partners, if Z retires. (Delhi 2014)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Old ratio of X : Y : Z = \(\frac{1}{2} : \frac{2}{5} : \frac{1}{10}=\frac{5}{10} : \frac{4}{10} : \frac{1}{10}\)
           <br/>
           = 5 : 4 : 1
           <br/>
           Z retires, after striking of the retiring Parmer’s ratio, remaining ratio will be new profit sharing ratio, i.e. 5 : 4.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           X, Y and Z were partners sharing profits in the ratio of \(\frac{1}{2}\), \(\frac{3}{10}\) and \(\frac{1}{5}\) X retired from the firm. Calculate the gaining ratio of the remaining partners. (All India 2014)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Old ratio of X : Y : Z = \(\frac{1}{2}: \frac{3}{10}: \frac{1}{5}=\frac{5}{10}: \frac{3}{10}: \frac{2}{10}\)
           <br/>
           = 5 : 3 : 2
           <br/>
           X retired, after striking of the retiring partner’s ratio, remaining ratio will be new profit sharing ratio, i.e. 3 : 2,
           <br/>
           New profit sharing ratio = Y : Z = 3 : 2
           <br/>
           Gaining Ratio = New Share – Old Share
           <br/>
           Y = \(\frac{3}{5}-\frac{3}{10}=\frac{6-3}{10}=\frac{3}{10}\)
           <br/>
           Z = \(\frac{2}{5}-\frac{2}{10}=\frac{4-2}{10}=\frac{2}{10}\)
           <br/>
           Gainingratio = 3 : 2

           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Give any one distinction between sacrificing ratio and gaining ratio. (All India 2012)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The difference between sacrificing ratio and gaining ratio is stated below
           <br/>
           Sacrificing ratio:
           <br/>
           It is the ratio in which old partners agree to sacrifice their share of profit in favour of new partner(s).
          </p>
          <p>
           Gaining ratio:
           <br/>
           It is the ratio in which continuing partners acquire the share of profit from outgoing partner(s).
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 6.
           <br/>
           (i) K, L and Z are partners sharing profits in the ratio of 4 : 3 : 2 respectively. L retired and surrendered \(\frac{1}{9}\)th of his share of profit to K and remaining in favour of Z. Calculate the new profit sharing ratio of K and Z.
           <br/>
           (ii) Arun, Varun and Charan are partners sharing profits in the ratio of \(\frac{1}{2}\), \(\frac{3}{10}\) and \(\frac{1}{5}\) respectively. Varun retired from the firm and Arun and Charan decided to share future profits in 3 : 2 ratio. Calculate gaining ratio of Arun and Charan. (All Indio (C) 2014)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Old ratio between K, L and Z = 4 : 3 : 2.
           <br/>
           Share surrendered in favour of K by L
           <br/>
           = \(\frac{3}{9} \times \frac{1}{9}=\frac{3}{81}\)
           <br/>
           Share surrendered in favour of Z by L
           <br/>
           <img alt="Reconstitution of Partnership Firm Retirement Death of a Partner Class 12 Important Questions and Answers Accountancy Chapter 4 Img 1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-147843" height="121" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Reconstitution-of-Partnership-Firm-Retirement-Death-of-a-Partner-Class-12-Important-Questions-and-Answers-Accountancy-Chapter-4-Img-1.png" width="258"/>
           <br/>
           ∴ New ratio = 39 : 42 or 13 : 14
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           (ii) Old ratio between Arun, Varun and Charan
           <br/>
           = \(\frac{1}{2}: \frac{3}{10}: \frac{1}{5}\) = 5 : 3 : 2
           <br/>
           New ratio between Arun and Charan = 3 : 2
           <br/>
           Gaining Ratio = New Share – Old Share
           <br/>
           <img alt="Reconstitution of Partnership Firm Retirement Death of a Partner Class 12 Important Questions and Answers Accountancy Chapter 4 Img 2" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-147844" height="104" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Reconstitution-of-Partnership-Firm-Retirement-Death-of-a-Partner-Class-12-Important-Questions-and-Answers-Accountancy-Chapter-4-Img-2.png" width="253"/>

           Question 7.
           <br/>
           Aman, Bimal and Deepak are partners sharing profits in the ratio of 2 : 3 : 5 . The goodwill of the firm has been valued at ₹ 37,500. Aman retired, Bimal and Deepak decided to share profits equally in future. Calculate gain/sacrifice of Bimal and Deepak on Aman’s retirement and also pass necessary journal entry for the treatment of goodwill. (All India 2019)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Calculation of Sacrificing or Gaining Ratio
           <br/>
           Sacrificing Ratio = Old share – New share
           <br/>
           Bimal = \(\frac{3}{10}-\frac{1}{2}=\frac{3-5}{10}=\left(\frac{2}{10}\right)\); Deepak = \(\frac{5}{10}-\frac{1}{2}=\frac{5-5}{10}\) = Nil
           <br/>
           Aman’s Share of Goodwill = 37,500 × \(\frac{2}{10}\) = ₹ 7,500

           <br/>
           P, Q and R were partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio of 5 : 4 : 3. Their capitals were ₹ 40,000, ₹ 50,000 and ₹ 1,00,000 respectively. State the ratio in which the goodwill of the firm amounting to ₹ 1,20,000 will be adjusted on the retirement of R. (All India (C) 2010)

           <br/>
           State the need for treatment of goodwill on the retirement of a partner. (All India 2010)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           At the time of retirement, retiring partner sacrifices his share of profit in favour of continuing partners, so the remaining partners compensate the retiring partner a share of the firm’s goodwill.

           2. Calculation of Share of Goodwill
           <br/>
           Guru’s share of goodwill = 3,60,000 × \(\frac{1}{8}\) = ₹ 45,000
           <br/>
           Kavi gains = 3,60,000 × \(\frac{9}{40}\) = ₹ 81,000
           <br/>
           Ravi sacrifices = 3,60,000 × \(\frac{2}{40}\) = ₹ 18,000
           <br/>
           Kumar sacrifices = 3,60,000 × \(\frac{2}{40}\) = ₹ 18,000

           Working Notes:
           <br/>
           1. Calculation of New Profit Sharing Ratio and Gaining Ratio
           <br/>
           Old ratio of Aijun, Bheem and Nakul = 14 : 5 : 6
           <br/>
           Bheem surrenders in favour of Arjun = \(\frac{5}{25}\)th share, Arjun’s new share = \(\frac{14}{25}+\frac{5}{25}=\frac{19}{25}\)
           <br/>
           New ratio of Aijun and Nakul = 19 : 6
           <br/>
           Gaining Ratio = New Share – Old Share
           <br/>
           Arjun = \(\frac{19}{25}-\frac{14}{25}=\frac{19-14}{25}=\frac{5}{25}\); Nakul = \(\frac{6}{25}-\frac{6}{25}=\frac{6-6}{25}\) = Nil
          </p>
          <p>
           2. Calculation of Bheem’s Share of Goodwill
           <br/>
           Actual average profit = \(\frac{50,000+55,000+60,000}{3}\) = ₹ 55,000; Normal profit = ₹ 30,000
           <br/>
           Super Profit = Average Profit – Normal Profit = 55,000 – 30,000 = ₹ 25,000
           <br/>
           Firm’s goodwill = 25,000 × 2 = ₹ 50,000
           <br/>
           Bheem’s share of goodwill = 50,000 × \(\frac{5}{25}\) = ₹ 10,000 (to be contributed by Arjun alone)

           Working Notes:
           <br/>
           1. Calculation of Gaining Ratio
           <br/>
           Gaining Ratio = New Share – Old Share
           <br/>
           Yasmin = \(\frac{3}{5}-\frac{3}{10}=\frac{6-3}{10}=\frac{3}{10}\); saloni = \(\frac{2}{5}-\frac{3}{10}=\frac{4-3}{10}=\frac{1}{10}\)
           <br/>
           Gaining ratio = 3 : 1
          </p>
          <p>
           2. Provision for Bad Debts:

          </p>
          <p>
           3. Calculation of Sameer’s Share of Goodwill
           <br/>
           Firm’s goodwill = ₹ 5,40,000
           <br/>
           Sameer’s share = 5,40,000 × \(\frac{4}{10}\) = ₹ 2,16,000

           Working Notes:
           <br/>
           1. Calculation of Gaining Ratio
           <br/>
           Gaining Ratio = New Share – Old Share
           <br/>
           J = \(\frac{3}{5}-\frac{5}{10}=\frac{6-5}{10}=\frac{1}{10}\); K = \(\frac{2}{5}-\frac{2}{10}=\frac{4-2}{10}=\frac{2}{10}\)
           <br/>
           Gaining ratio = 1 : 2
          </p>
          <p>
           2. Adjustment for Goodwill Firm’s goodwill = ₹ 1,02,000
           <br/>
           H’s share of goodwill = 1,02,000 × \(\frac { 3 }{ 10 }\) = ₹ 30,600 will be debited to gaining partners, i.e. J and K in gaining ratio, i.e. 1 : 2
           <br/>
           J’s share = 30,600 × \(\frac { 1 }{ 3 }\) = ₹ 10,200; K’s share = 30,600 × \(\frac { 2 }{ 3 }\) = ₹ 20,400
          </p>
          <p>
           3. Adjustment of Capital
           <br/>
           J’s capital after adjustment = 1,36,800
           <br/>
           (+) K’s capital after adjustment = 38,400
           <br/>
           Total capital of new firm = ₹ 1,75,200
           <br/>
           J’s adjusted capital = 1,75,200 × \(\frac { 3 }{ 5 }\) = ₹ 1,05,120; K’s adjusted capital = 1,75,200 × \(\frac { 2 }{ 5 }\) = ₹ 70,080

           Working notes:
           <br/>
           1. Calculation of Gaining Ratio
           <br/>
           Gaining Ratio = New Share – Old Share
           <br/>
           Leena = \(\frac{3}{5}-\frac{2}{7}=\frac{21-10}{35}=\frac{11}{35}\); Naresh = \(\frac{2}{5}-\frac{3}{7}=\frac{14-15}{35}= \frac{1}{35}\) sacrifice
          </p>
          <p>
           2. Calculation of Share of Goodwill
           <br/>
           Madan’s share of goodwill = 5,60,000 × \(\frac { 2 }{ 7 }\) = ₹ 1,60,000 to be contributed by Leena alone. As she is the only gaining partner, she will compensate to Naresh also.
          </p>
          <p>
           3. Calculation of Capital of Partners in New firm
           <br/>
           New profit sharing ratio = 3 : 2
           <br/>
           Leena’s capital = 32,00,000 × \(\frac { 3 }{ 5 }\) = ₹ 19,20,000; Naresh’s capital = 32,00,000 x \(\frac { 2 }{ 5 }\) = ₹ 12,80,000

           <br/>
           1. Calculation of Gaining Ratio
           <br/>
           Gaining Ratio = New Share – Old Share
           <br/>
           Xavier = \(\frac{2}{3}-\frac{4}{9}=\frac{6-4}{9}=\frac{2}{9}\); Zaman = \(\frac{1}{3}-\frac{2}{9}=\frac{3-2}{9}=\frac{1}{9}\)
           <br/>
           Gaining ratio = 2 : 1
          </p>
          <p>
           2. Adjustment of Goodwill:
           <br/>
           Yusuf’s share of goodwill = 54,000 x \(\frac { 3 }{ 5 }\) = ₹ 18,000 to be contributed in gaining ratio, i.e. 2 : 1
           <br/>
           Xavier will pay =18,OOO x \(\frac { 2 }{ 3 }\) = ₹ 12,000; Zaman will pay = 18,000 x \(\frac { 1 }{ 3 }\) = ₹ 6,000

           Question 48.
           <br/>
           Dinkar, Navita and Vani were partners sharing profits and losses in the ratio of 3 : 2 : 1. Navita died on 30th June, 2017. Her share of profit for the intervening period was based on the sales during that period, which were ₹ 6,00,000. The rate of profit during the past four years had been 10% on sales. The firm closes its books on 31st March every year.
           <br/>
           Calculate Navita’s share of profit. (All india 2019)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Total sales = ₹ 6,00,000 (1st April, 2017-30th June, 2017)
           <br/>
           Finn’s profit on sales = 600000 × 10% = ₹ 60,000
           <br/>
           Navita’s share of profit = 60000 × \(\frac { 2 }{ 6 }\) = ₹ 20,000

           Question 49.
           <br/>
           Jayant, Kartik and Leena were partners in a firm sharing profits and losses in the ratio of 6 : 2 : 3. Kartik died and Jayant and Leena decided to continue the business. Their gaining ratio was 2 : 3. Calculate the new profit sharing ratio of Jayant and Leena. (CBSE 2018)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Jayant’s old share = \(\frac { 5 }{ 10 }\) Jayant’s gaining share = \(\frac{2}{5} \times \frac{2}{10}=\frac{4}{50}\)
           <br/>
           Jayant’s New Share = Old Share + Gaining share = \(\frac{5}{10}+\frac{4}{50}=\frac{25+4}{50}=\frac{29}{50}\)
           <br/>
           Leena’s old share = \(\frac { 3 }{ 10 }\); Leena’s gaining share = \(\frac{3}{5} \times \frac{2}{10}=\frac{6}{50}\)
           <br/>
           Leena s new share = \(\frac{3}{10}+\frac{6}{50}=\frac{15+6}{50}=\frac{21}{50}\)
           <br/>
           New profit sharing ratio = Jayant : Leena = 29 : 21

           Question 57.
           <br/>
           A, B and C are partners in a firm whose books are closed on 31st March each year. B died on 30th June, 2009 and according to the agreement, the share of profit of a deceased partner up to the date of the death is to be calculated on the basis of the average profits for the last five years.
           <br/>
           The net profits for the last 5 years have been 2005 : ₹ 14,000; 2006 : ₹ 18,000; 2007 : ₹ 16,000; 2008 : ₹ 10,000 (loss) and 2009 : ₹ 16,000. Calculate B’s share of profita upto the date of death and pass necessary journal entry. (All India; 2010)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Calculation of B’s Share of Profit
           <br/>
           Last 5 years’ total profit = 14,000 + 18,000 + 16,000 – 10,000 + 16,000 = ₹ 54,000
           <br/>
           Average profit = \(\frac { 54,000 }{ 5 }\) = ₹ 10,800
           <br/>
           B’s Share of profit = 10,800 × \(\frac { 1 }{ 3 }\) × \(\frac { 3 }{ 12 }\) = 900

           <br/>
           Average profit or goodwill = \(\frac { 1200000 }{ 4 }\) = 3,00,000

           <br/>
           Rekha’s share of profit = 3,40,000 x \(\frac { 4 }{ 10 }\) x \(\frac { 3 }{ 12 }\) = ₹ 34,000

           <br/>
           1. Calculation of Share of Goodwill
           <br/>
           Average profit = \(\frac{1,90,000+1,70,000+1,80,000+1,60,000}{4}\) = 1,75,000
           <br/>
           Goodwill = Average Profit × Number of Years Purchase
           <br/>
           = 1,75,000 x 3 = ₹ 5,25,000
           <br/>
           Karan’s share = 5,25,000 × \(\frac { 3 }{ 10 }\) = ₹ 1,57,500, to be contributed by Arun and Varun in gaining ratio i.e. 4 : 3, Arun will contribute = 1,57,500 x \(\frac { 4 }{ 7 }\) = ₹ 90,000, Varun will contribute = ₹ 1,57,500 x \(\frac { 3 }{ 7 }\) = ₹ 67,500
          </p>
          <p>
           2. Calculation of Profit upto Death
           <br/>
           Average profit = ₹ 1,75,000
           <br/>
           Karan’s share of profit = 1,75,000 x \(\frac { 3 }{ 6 }\) x \(\frac { 6 }{ 12 }\) = ₹ 26,250
           <br/>
           NOTE: As there is no credit balance in capital account of Karan, he will not get interest on capital.

           <br/>
           On 1st January, 2008, Uday and Kaushal entered into partnership with fixed capitals of ₹ 7,00,000 and ₹ 3,00,000 respectively. They were doing good business and were interested in its expansion but could not do the same because of lack of capital. Therefore, to have more capital, they admitted Govind as a new partner on 1st January, 2010. Govind brought . ₹ 10,00,000 as capital and the new profit sharing ratio decided was 3 : 2 : 5. On 1st January, 2012, another new partner Hari was admitted with a capital of ₹ 8,00,000 for 1/10th share in the profits, which he acquired equally from Uday, Kaushal and Govind. On 1st April, 2014, Govind died and his share was taken over by Uday and Hari equally.

           Working Note:
           <br/>
           1. Calculation of A’s Share of Capital
           <br/>
           Total fixed capital of the firm = ₹ 60,000; A’s share = 60,000 x \(\frac { 1 }{ 3 }\) = ₹ 20,000
          </p>
          <p>
           2. Calculation of A’s Share of Goodwill
           <br/>
           Last 3 years profit = 21,200 – 3,200 + 9,000 = ₹ 27,000; Average profit = \(\frac { 27000 }{ 3 }\) = ₹ 9,000
           <br/>
           Firm’s Goodwill = Average Profit x Number of Years Purchase
           <br/>
           = 9,000 x 2 = ₹ 18,000
           <br/>
           A’s share of goodwill = 18,000 x \(\frac { 1 }{ 3 }\) = ₹ 6,000, to be contributed by B and C in their gaining ratio, i.e. 1 : 1. C will contribute = 6,000 x \(\frac { 1 }{ 2 }\) = ₹ 3,000, B will contribute =6,000 x \(\frac { 1 }{ 2 }\) = ₹ 3,000
          </p>
          <p>
           3. Calculation of A’s Share of Profit
           <br/>
           A’s share of profit = 9,000 x \(\frac { 1 }{ 3 }\) x \(\frac { 9 }{ 12 }\) = ₹ 2,250
          </p>
          <p>
           4. Calculation of Interest on A’s Capital
           <br/>
           Interest on A’s capital = 20,000 x \(\frac { 6 }{ 100 }\) x \(\frac { 9 }{ 12 }\) = ₹ 900

          </p>
          <p>
           Working Notes:
           <br/>
           1. Calculation of Seth’s Share of Profit
           <br/>
           Number of days Seth worked for = Jan + Feb + March = 31 + 28 + 14 = 73 days
           <br/>
           Share of Seth’s profit = 60,000 x \(\frac { 73 }{ 365 }\) x \(\frac { 2 }{ 10 }\) = ₹ 2,400
          </p>
          <p>
           2. Calculation of Khanna’s and Mehta’s Capital
           <br/>
           Khanna’s capital after adjustment = 2,45,100
           <br/>
           Mehta’s capital after adjustment = 4,08,500
           <br/>
           Total capital = ₹ 6,53,600
           <br/>
           Khanna’s capital = 6,53,600 x \(\frac { 3 }{ 8 }\) = ₹ 2,45,100 ; Mehta’s capital = 6,53,600 x \(\frac { 5 }{ 8 }\) = ₹ 4,08,500
           <br/>
           So, there is no deficit or surplus in Khanna’s and Mehta’s capital account which is to be adjusted through current accounts.

           Working Notes:
           <br/>
           1. Calculation of Interest on N’s Capital
           <br/>
           Interest on N’s capital = 70,000 x \(\frac { 5 }{ 100 }\) x \(\frac { 73 }{ 365 }\) = ₹ 700
          </p>
          <p>
           2. Calculation of Goodwill
           <br/>
           3 years total profit = 80,000 + 90,000 + 1,00,000 = ₹ 2,70,000
           <br/>
           Average profit = \(\frac { 270000 }{ 3 }\) = ₹ 90,000
           <br/>
           Firm’s Goodwill = Average Profit x Number of Years Purchase = 90,000 x 2 = ₹ 1,80,000
           <br/>
           N’s share of goodwill = 1,80,000 x \(\frac { 1 }{ 3 }\) = ₹ 60,000
          </p>
          <p>
           3. Calculation of N’s Stare of Profit
           <br/>
           N’s share of profit = (90,000 x 2) x \(\frac { 73 }{ 365 }\) x \(\frac { 1 }{ 3 }\) = ₹ 12,000
