           (ii) A regular arrangement of the constituent particles of a crystal in a three dimensional space is called crystal lattice.
           <br/>
           The smallest three dimensional portion of a complete crystal lattice, which when repeated over and again in different directions produces the complete crystal lattice is called the unit cell.

           Question 11.
           <br/>
           State the Kohlrausch law of independent migration of ions. Why does the conductivity of a solution decrease with dilution? [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Kohlrausch law of independent migration of ions : The limiting molar conductivity of an electrolyte (i.e. molar conductivity at infinite dilution) is the sum of the limiting ionic conductivities of the cation and the anion each multiplied with the number of ions present in one formula unit of the electrolyte

           Question 13.
           <br/>
           Explain the principle of the method of electrolytic refining of metals. Give one example. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Electrolytic refining: Here the impure metal is made to act as anode and a strip of the same metal in pure form is used as cathode. When they both are put in suitable electrolyte containing soluble salt of same metal, the more basic metal remains in the solution and the less basic ones go to the anode mud.
           <br/>
           Example: In refining of Cu
           <br/>
           At anode: (oxidation)

           Question 21.
           <br/>
           What are emulsions? What are their different types? Give one example of each type. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Emulsion : The colloidal solution in which both dispersed phase and medium are in liquid state is called emulsion. This is liquid-liquid colloidal system.
          </p>
          <p>
           Different types of emulsions are :
           <br/>
           Emulsions of oil in water in which oil is the dispersed phase and water is the dispersion medium.
           <br/>
           Example : Milk is an emulsion of liquid fat dispersed in water.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) (CH
           <sub>

           )
           <sub>
            3
           </sub>
           P = 0 exists due to presence of empty d-orbitals and thus can expand its covalency upto 6 but (CH

           )
           <sub>

           </sub>
           N = O cann’t expand its covalency due to absence of d-orbitals.
           <br/>
           (ii) The least negative electron gains enthalpy of oxygen is due to small size and more interelectronic repulsion with coming electron.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Due to presence of two H-atoms on N-atom of primary amines, they undergo extensive intermolecular H-bonding while tertiary amines due to the absence of a H-atom on the N-atom, do not undergo H-bonding. As a result, primary amines have higher boiling points than 3° amines.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Aniline being a Lewis base reacts with Lewis acid AlCl
           <sub>
            3

           to form a salt.

           <br/>
           As a result, N of aniline acquires positive charge and hence it acts as a strong deactivating group for electrophilic substitution reaction. Consequently, aniline does not undergo Freidel Craft reaction.

           Define the following terms related to proteins: [3]
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) Peptide linkage

           (ii) Primary structure
           <br/>
           (iii) Denaturation
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Peptide linkage : It is an amide linkage formed between – COOH group of one a-amino acid and NH
           <sub>
            2

           group of the other α-amino acid by loss of a molecule of water. – CO – NH – bond is called Peptide linkage.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Primary structure : Proteins may have one or more polypeptide chains. Each polypeptide in a protein has amino acids linked with each other in a specific sequence which is known as primary structure of protein.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Denaturation of protein : Due to coagulation of globular protein under the influence of change in temperature, change in pH etc., the native shape of the protein is destroyed and biological activity is lost and the protein so formed is called denaturated proteins and the phenomenon is denaturation.

           Dr Satpal organized a ‘health camp’ for the poor fanners living in a nearby village. After checkup, he was shocked to see that most of the farmers suffered from cancer due to regular exposure to pesticides and many were diabetic. They distributed free medicines to them. Dr Satpal immediately reported the matter to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). On the suggestions of NHRC, the government decided to provide medical care, financial assistance, setting up of super-speciality hospitals for treatment and prevention of the deadly disease in the affected villages all over India.

           (b) A solution of glucose (molar mass = 180 g mol
           <sup>
            -1
           </sup>
           ) in water is labelled as 10% (by mass). What would be the molality and molarity of the solution? (Density of solution = 1.2 g mL

            -1
           </sup>
           )
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) (i) Molarity is the number of moles of solute dissolved in one litre of solution.
           <br/>
           (ii) Molal elevation constant may be defined as the elevation in boiling point when the molality of solution is unity i.e. 1 mole of solute is dissolved in 1 kg of the solvent.
           <br/>
           (b) For urea, concentration = \(\frac{15}{60}\) moles/lt.
           <br/>
           For glucose, concentration = \(\frac{w}{180}\)moles/lt.
           <br/>
           ∵ Solutions are isotonic
           <br/>
           ∴ \(\frac{w}{180}\) = \(\frac{15}{60}\) ∴ w = \(\frac{15 \times 180}{60}\) = 45 g

           Or
          </p>
          <p>
           (a) It shows positive deviation due to weaker interactions between acetone and ethanol- ethanol interactions.
           <br/>
           (b) 10% glucose means 10 g in 100 g solution or, 90 g of water = 0.090 kg of water
           <br/>
           ∴ Molality = \(\frac{10}{180 \times 0.090}\) = 0.617 m
           <br/>
           100 g of solution = \(\frac{100}{1.2}\) mL = 83.33 mL = 0.08333 L
           <br/>
           ∴ Molality = \(\frac{10}{180 \times 0.0833}\) = 0.67 M

           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Why is adsorption always exothermic? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Adsorption is accompanied by decrease of randomness. For the process to be spontaneous, ∆G must be negative.
           <br/>
           Hence, according to equation ∆G = ∆H — T∆S, ∆G can be -ve only if ∆H is negative.

           Question 17.
           <br/>
           Write the principle behind the froth floatation process. What is the role of collectors in this process? [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Principle:
           <br/>
           Froth floatation process : This method is used for removing gangue from suiphide ores. In this powdered ore is mixed with collectors (e.g. pine oils, fatty acids etc.) and froth stabilisers (e.g. cresols, aniline) which enhance non-wettability of the mineral particles and froth stabilisation respectively. As a result of which ore comes with froth and gangue remain in the solution.
           <br/>
           Role : Collectors e.g. pine oils, fatty acids etc. enhance non-wettability of the mineral particles.

           (iii) Essential amino acids
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Nucleotide : A nucleotide contains all the three basic components of nucleic acids, i.e. a phosphoric acid group, a pentose sugar and a nitrogenous base. These are formed by estenfication of C
           <sub>

           <br/>
           (iii) Essential amino acids: Amino acids which the body cannot synthesize are called essential amino acids.
           <br/>
           Examples : Valine, leucine etc. Therefore they must be supplied in diet.
