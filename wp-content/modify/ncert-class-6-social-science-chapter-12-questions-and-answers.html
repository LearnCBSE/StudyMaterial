           Question 1.
           <br/>
           What are urban local bodies and what are their functions?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           As per Constitution we have local government structures in urban areas called Tirban local bodies’. According to the size and population of the cities we have:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Municipal Corporation: Cities with a population above 10 lakhs have a Municipal Corporation. They are also known as ‘Mahanagar Nigam’.
           </li>
           <li>
            Municipal Council: Cities with population between 1 and 10 lakhs, the highest body is called as Municipal Council. They are also called ‘Nagar Palika’.
           </li>
           <li>
            Nagar Panchayat: Towns with smaller populations below 1 lakh have Nagar Panchayat.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           The functions of the Urban bodies includes the construction and maintenance of infrastructure, burial ground, garbage collection and disposal, water supply, running of primary schools and healthcare system, collecting local taxes and fines and many other essential services.

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Why are they important in governance and democracy?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Urban local bodies are form of local government in urban areas that take care of daily needs like water supply, garbage disposable, maintenance of parks and burial grounds and others. These decisions are collectively taken with the participation of local people of the same areas. With the one-third reservation of women in urban bodies, it has widened the concept of participatory democracy. Their existence has made the burden of central and government lighter and more effective.

           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Why is a city like Kolkata, Chennai or Mumbai more complex and diverse than a village or a town? (Page 174)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           City like Kolkata, Chennai or Mumbai are more complex and diverse than a village or a town because it has
           <br/>
           huge and diverse population coming from different states, different religion, caste, economic background. These are the’ place with huge job opportunities, better infrastructure such as local bus service, local trains and Metro. Diverse people stay together and share their respective culture, food habits, festivals clothing and traditional life styles. These features make cities like Kolkata and Mumbai more diverse and complex.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           With your classmates, make a list of diverse communities residing in any city that you are familiar with. How many were you able to list? What else do you observe in the list? (Page 174)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Hint Based…Response can vary according to cities, towns and villages.
           <br/>
           Let us take an example of Delhi. Delhi is the capital city of India and people from almost all kind of diversity reside here: For example, we can see people from Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Manipur, Tripura, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Bihar, UP and others.
          </p>
          <p>
           Even people from foreign countries like Nepal, Bangladesh, Kenya, Britain, French stays in Delhi.
           <br/>
           Observation: Delhi is a cosmopolitan cities with huge diversity, people from across caste, gender, religion, region and economic background stays peacefully here. It makes Delhi a culturally rich city.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Similarities:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Governance: Both the pancha¬yati raj system and urban local governments are forms of decentralised for local areas like villages and cities respectively. They are responsible for taking care of people’s needs and ensuring basic services to the people in their areas.
           </li>
           <li>
            Members are chosen through elections held after five years.
           </li>
           <li>
            One-third seats are reserved for women in both the set ups.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Differences: Panchayati raj is a three- tier system looking at the need of people in rural areas, whereas urban local bodies are either single or two-tier structure looking at the administration of urban areas.
           <br/>
           The panchayati bodies have less resources as compare to urban bodies.
          </p>

           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Indore in Madhya Pradesh has been awarded the cleanest city in India under the Swachh Survekshan government scheme for seven years in a row. What could have been the role of Indore citizens in this achievement? (Page 1 79)

           Answer:
           <br/>
           All governments work for the welfare and happiness of the people. Indore’s local bodies have been delivering the best services and citizens have taken their role in positive and affirmative manners.

They have volunteered up themselves in solving many issues like not littering on road, avoiding the use of plastics, using more of public transports system. Through regular campaigns they encourage people, take care of their cities and to be part of solution.
