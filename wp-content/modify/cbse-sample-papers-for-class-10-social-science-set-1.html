           <br/>
           (A) The Spanish conquerors won America with not conventional military weapon but with germs like smallpox which spread deep into the continent before any European could reach there.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           (B) “Traders and travelers introduced new crops to lands they travelled. “Substantiate this statement with illustrations
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            America’s original inhabitants had no immunity against these diseases that came from Europe. This disease erased the whole community, leading to conquest. This biological warfare in the mid-sixteenth century made it easy for the Spanish to overpower the Americans.
           </li>

          <p>
           OR

           </li>
           <li>
            It is believed that noodles travelled West from China to become Spaghetti. Perhaps Arab Traders took Pasta to fifth century Cecily and Island now in Italy,

            Many of our common foods such as potatoes, soya, groundnuts, maize, tomatoes, chilies, sweet potatoes, and so on were not known to our ancestors until about five centuries ago. These foods were only introduced in Europe and Asia after Christopher Columbus accidentally discovered the vast continent that would later become known as America. Many of our common foods came from America’s original inhabitants – the American Indians.

           Mention any four reasons to prove that India is a federal country.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The following are the reasons which prove that India is a federal country.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Division of Powers: The Constitution of India demarcates the powers of the Central and State governments, and both have their separate areas of jurisdiction. The Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution lists the Union List, State List, and Concurrent List, which define the powers and responsibilities of the Central and State governments.
           </li>
           <li>
            Independent Judiciary: India has an independent judiciary with the power of judicial review.
            <br/>
            The Supreme Court of India is the highest judicial authority in the country and has the power to interpret the Constitution and resolve disputes between the Central and State governments.
           </li>
           <li>
            Representation of States: The Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament, represents the States and Union Territories of India. The members of the Rajya Sabha are elected by the elected members of the Legislative Assemblies of the States and Union Territories.
           </li>
           <li>
            Special Status to States: Some States in India enjoy special status and have been granted more autonomy than others. For example, Jammu and Kashmir have their own Constitution and a separate flag, and Nagaland has its own constitutions and a special status under Article 371A of the Indian Constitution. These factors contribute to India being a federal country where power is divided between the Central and State governments.

           Question 27.
           <br/>
           How can we say that globalization has been advantageous to consumers as well as producers? Give reasons. (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           We can say that globalization has been advantageous to both consumers as well as producers due to the following reasons
           <br/>
           Globalization has led to an intense increase in industrial competition. As a result, producers are competing over each other to provide better and cheaper services to the consumers. This has also resulted in a reduction in the prices.
          </p>
          <p>
           With the initiation of globalization, producers now have actively free access to international markets. Also. they can avail more easily of the credit facilities forwarded in terms of capita’ and technology. For instance in the case of the electronics goods and garments industry.
          </p>
          <p>
           Consumers have more chances of goods and services as compared to earlier times, especially in modern digital technological equipment like cell phones, cameras, etc.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) The Indian Constitution has a three-fold distribution of legislative power, which contains three lists: The Union List, the State List, and the Concurrent List. The subjects that are included in the Union List are those that are under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Union Government. Some of the subjects that are included in the Union List are:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Defense of the country
           </li>
           <li>
            Foreign affairs and relations
           </li>
           <li>
            Banking, currency, and coinage
           </li>
           <li>

           Question 29.
           <br/>
           Evaluate the various impacts of First World War on the economy of Britain. (3)
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Do you agree that agriculture in India takes place in the unorganised sector? Give three points. (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The impact of First World War on Britain’s economy were as follows
           <br/>
           (i) Britain which was a leading economy of the world before the First World War faced a prolonged crisis. While Britain was preoccupied with war, industries had developed in Japan and India. After the war, Britain found it difficult to recapture its earlier position.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Britain has borrowed liberal’y from the USA for its war time expenditure, thus at the end of the war, Britain was burdened with huge external debt.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) After the war, production in Britain contracted which led to huge job losses. In 1921, one in every five British workers was out of work. Anxiety and uncertainty about work became an enduring part of the post-war time.
          </p>
          <p>
           Or
           <br/>
           Yes, Indian agriculture is mostly concentrated in the unorganized sector. This is justified through the following points
           <br/>
           (i) Agriculture in India faces the problem of disguised unemployment which means more people are employed than needed So this shows that agriculture is unorganized.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Farmers are employed during harvesting and sowing season while the rest of the time they are unemployed, So, the problem of underemployment shows that agriculture is unorganized.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Most of the farmers depend on moneylenders. rich farmers and relatives for taking loans instead of banks. Then they have to pay high interest, which means that agriculture in India is an unorganized sector.

           <br/>
           The hazards of mining or the impacts of mining on the health of the miners and the environment are given below:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The dust and noxious fumes inhaled by miners make them vulnerable to pulmonary diseases.
           </li>
           <li>
            The risk of collapsing mine roofs.
           </li>
           <li>
            Inundation and fires in coal mines are a constant threat to miners.
            <br/>
            The fact that mining is one of the most dangerous jobs, mining usually hurts the environment with the production of a lot of waste.
           </li>
           <li>
            Disruption to the local flora and fauna, and contamination of local water sources.

            They are inexhaustible and renewable. They are also considered as clean sources of energy.
           </li>
           <li>
            Optimal use of resources of energy minimizes environmental impact and non-conventional resources produce minimum secondary waste
            <br/>
            compared to use conventional sources.
           </li>
           <li>
            The growing consumption of energy has resulted in the country becoming increasingly depend on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas. Rising prices of oil and gas and their potential shortages have raised uncertainties about the security of energy supply in future., which in turn has serious repercussions on the growth of the national economy.
           </li>
           <li>
            Natural gas is considered an environmentally friendly fuel because of low carbon dioxide emissions. It does not cause air pollution or environmental degradation, thus, it is the fuel for present century.
           </li>
           <li>
            Renewable energy resources technologies provide an excellent opportunity for mitigation of greenhouse gas emission and reducing global

           The significance of secondary sector in Indian economy are as follows
           <br/>
           Secondary sector involves the industrial production. Industrial activities utilise the materials produced in the primary sector. In the process, it creates massive employment of various scales. It also induces service sector like transport, market, etc to flourish. As all the sectors of economy are interdependent, secondary sector has a great contribution for the sustainance and growth of other sectors.
          </p>
          <p>
           The secondary sector induces growth and productivity to primary sector and helps in flourishing of teiliary sector,

          <ul>
           <li>
            It produces instruments and appliances that directly help primary sector for better production.
           </li>
           <li>
            It absorbs excess labour from the primary sector and reduces disguised unemployment.
           </li>
           <li>
            It also contributes significantly to the GDP of India and employment basket.

           The features of alluvial soil are as follows
           <br/>
           Formation Alluvial soil is made-up of silt, sand and clay. It is deposited by three important Himalayan river systems-the Indus, the Ganga and the Brahmaputra. It is bigger and coarser in the upper reaches of the river and becomes finer as the river
           <br/>
           flows down.
          </p>
          <p>
           Distribution/Area This soil is prevalent in the river valleys of the Northern plains (Indus, Ganga, Brahmaputra), strips in Gujarat and Rajasthan. as well as in the Eastern coastal plains in the deltas of rivers of the Peninsular plateau (Mahanadi, Krishna,
           <br/>
           Kaveri).
          </p>
          <p>
           Classification According to their age, alluvial soil can be classified as (Bangar) old alluvial and Khadar (new alluvial). Khadar has higher concentration of Kankar and contains more tine particles than Bangar.
          </p>
          <p>
           Nutrients/Minerals This soil is rich in nutrients like potash, phosphoric acid, and lime, which is suitable for growing paddy, wheat, sugarcane, and other cereal and pulse crops.

           Question 34.
           <br/>
           Read the given source below and answer the following questions: (4)
           <br/>
           It is said of “passive resistance” it is the weapon of the weak, but the power which is the subject of this article can be used only by the strong. This power is not passive resistance; indeed, it calls for intense activity. The movement in South Africa was not passive but active … ‘Satyagraha is not physical force. Satyagraha does not inflict pain on the adversary; he does not seek his destruction … In the use of satyagraha, there is no ill will whatever. ‘Satyagraha is pure soul force. Truth is the very substance of the soul. That is why this force is called satyagraha. The soul is informed with knowledge. In it burns the flame of love. … Nonviolence is the supreme dharma …’ It is certain that India cannot rival Britain or Europe in force of arms. The British worship the war god and they can all of them become, as they are becoming, bearers of arms. The hundreds of millions in India can never carry arms. They have made the religion of non-violence their own.
           <br/>
           In his famous book Hind Swaraj (1909) Mahatma Gandhi declared that British rule was established in India, with the cooperation of Indians, and had survived only because of this cooperation. If Indians refused to cooperate, British rule would collapse within a year.
          </p>
          <p>
           (a) Why did Gandhiji say that passive resistance is not the weapon of the weak?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Gandhiji said” passive resistance is not the weapon of the weak because it calls for intense activity with a lot of inner strength.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) “Satyagraha is pure soul-force”. Substantiate this statement in 20 words.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (b) Truth is the very substance of the soul that is informed with knowledge and thus this force is called satyagraha.
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) What according to Mahatma Gandhi is the best weapon to use to collapse British rule in India?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Mahatma Gandhi in his book Hind Swaraj declared that through noncooperation(Satyagraha) only British rule could collapse in India as they could build their empire only with the cooperation of Indians.

           Question 35.
           <br/>
           Read the given extract and answer the following questions.
           <br/>
           The distribution pattern of the Railway network in the country has been largely influenced by Physiographic, economic, and administrative factors. The Northern plains with their vast level land, high population density, and rich agricultural resources provided the most favorable conditions for their growth. However, a large number of rivers requiring construction of bridges across their wide beds posed some obstacles, in the hills’ terrains of the peninsular region, railway tracts arc laid through low hills, gaps or tunnels.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Himalayan mountainous regions too are unfavourable for the construction of railway lines due to high relief, sparse population and lack of economic opportunities. Likewise, it was difficult to lay railway lines on the sandy plain of Western Rajasthan, swamps of Gujarat, forested tracks of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, and Jharkhand. The contiguous stretch of Sahyadri could be crossed only through gaps or passes (Ghats).
          </p>
          <p>
           In recent times, the development of the Konkan railway along the West coast has facilitated the movement of passengers and goods in this most important economic region of India. It has also faced several problem such as sinking of track in some stretches and landslides.
          </p>
          <p>
           Today, the railways have become more important in our National economy than all other rncans of transport put together. However, rail transport suffers from certain problems as well. Many passengers travel without tickets. Thefts and damaging of railway property has not yet stopped completely. People stop the trains, pull the chain unnecessarily and this causes heavy damage to the railway.
           <br/>
           (i) State the factors which influence the railway network in India. (1)
           <br/>
           (ii) Constructing the railways in the Peninsular region, Himalayan region, Rajasthan and Gujarat is a diflicult task.
           <br/>
           State any two reasons which are responsible behind this. (2)
           <br/>
           (iii) Railways are important part of our national economy, but still it is facing several problems. State any two reasons behind this.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Factors which are largely responsible to influence the railway network in India are physiographic. economic and administrative factors.
           <br/>
           (ii) It is difficult to construct railway lines in the Peninsular region, Himalayan region. Rajasthan and Gujarat. The reasons for this are The Peninsular region and the Himalayan region are hilly and mountainous regions. Peninsular region has undulating topography where railway tracts are laid through low hills, gaps or tunnels. On the other hand, the Himalayas have high relief, sparse population and lack of economic opportunities. Rajasthan has sandy plains and Gujarat has swampy lands thus, to construct railway lines there is a difficult task.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) It is true that railways have become more important in our national economy, but still this transport is facing several problems.
          </p>
          <p>
           The reasons for this are
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Many passengers travel by trains without tickets.
           </li>
           <li>
            This incurs heavy loss of rail budget.
           </li>

           Question 36.
           <br/>
           Read the source given below and answer the questions that follow: (4)
           <br/>
           For comparing countries, their income is considered to be one of the most important attributes. Countries with higher income are more developed than others with less income. This is based on the understanding that more income means more of all things that human beings need. Whatever people like, and should have, they will be able to get with greater income. So, greater income itself is considered to be one important goal. Now, what is the income of a country? Intuitively, the income of the country is the income of all the residents of the country. This gives us the total income of the country. However, for comparison between countries, total income is not such a useful measure. Since, countries have different populations, comparing total income will not tell us what an average person is likely to earn. Are people in one country better off than others in a different country? Hence, we compare the average income which is the total income of the country divided by its total population. The average income is also called per capita income. In World Development Reports, brought out by the World Bank, this criterion is used in classifying countries. Countries with per capita income of US$ 49,300 per annum and above in 2019, are called high income or rich countries and those with per capita income of US$ 2500 or less are called low-income countries. The rich countries, excluding countries of Middle East and certain other small countries are generally called developed countries.
           <br/>
           1. Explain the significance of per capita Income.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Per capita income enables comparisons between countries and provides insights into the relative economic performance and living standards across different nations. Per capita income also serves as an important indicator of the standard of living in a country.
          </p>
          <p>
           2. What are the classifications of countries based on per capita income, and which entity is responsible for determining these classifications?”
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The courtiers are classified into “High-income or Rich countries and low-income countries based on their per capita Income. If it is US $ 49,300 per annum they will be classified as rich country and if the per capita income is US$ 2500 per annum it will be called a poor country. World Bank determines this classification.
