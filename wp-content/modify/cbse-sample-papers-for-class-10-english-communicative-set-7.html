           I. Read the following passage. (12 m)
          </p>
          <p>
           1. I got posted in Srinagar in the 1980s. Its rugged mountains, gushing rivers and vast meadows reminded me of the landscapes of my native place – the Jibhi Valley in Himachal Pradesh. Unlike Srinagar that saw numerous tourists, Jibhi Valley remained clouded in anonymity. That’s when the seed of starting tourism in Jibhi was planted. I decided to leave my service in the Indian Army and follow the urge to return home.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           2. We had two houses – a family house and a traditional house, which we often rented out. I pleaded with my father to ask the tenant to vacate the house so that I could convert it into a guesthouse. When my family finally relented, I renovated the house keeping its originality intact, just adding windows for sunlight.
          </p>
          <p>
           3. I still remember the summer of 1992 when I put a signboard outside my first guesthouse in Jibhi Valley! The village residents, however, were sceptical about my success. My business kept growing but it took years for tourism to take off in Jibhi Valley. Things changed significantly after 2008 when the government launched a homestay scheme. People built homestays and with rapid tourism growth, the region also changed rapidly. Villages turned into towns with many concrete buildings. Local businesses and tourists continued putting a burden on nature.
          </p>
          <p>
           4. Then, with the 2020-21 pandemic and lockdown, tourism came to a complete standstill in Jibhi Valley. Local people, who were employed at over a hundred homestays and guesthouses, returned to their villages. Some went back to farming, some took up pottery and some got involved in government work schemes. Now, all ardently hope that normalcy and tourism will return to the valley soon. In a way, the pandemic has given us an opportunity to introspect, go back to our roots and look for sustainable solutions.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           5. For me, tourism has been my greatest teacher. It brought people from many countries and all states of India to my guesthouse. It gave me exposure to different cultures and countless opportunities to learn new things. Most people who stayed at my guesthouse became my repeat clients and good friends. When I look back, I feel proud, yet humbled at the thought that I was not only able to fulfill my dream despite all the challenges, but also to play a role in establishing tourism in the beautiful valley that I call home.

           Respected Sir/Ma’am,
          </p>
          <p>
           This is to inform you that I am PQR of Class X of your school. I have written this mail to request a fee concession as the financial condition of my family is not good. My father is the only earning member in the family and recently had to be hospitalised due to an accident. So, I will be unable to pay my school fees.
           <br/>
           Therefore, I request you to grant me full concession in school fees. I will be highly obliged to you.
          </p>
          <p>
           Thanking you
           <br/>
           Yours obediently

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           During our recent school excursion to the Taj Mahal, I was spellbound by its majestic beauty. The Taj, an ivory-white marble mausoleum, stands as an architectural masterpiece and symbol of eternal love. Its symmetrical design and intricate details, including delicate marble inlay work and Quranic calligraphy, showcase the brilliance of Mughal architecture. The central dome and four towering minarets create a perfect harmony of form and function. The serene Yamuna River adds to its charm. As I stood before this UNESCO World Heritage site, I felt the history and love that envelops it, making the Taj Mahal an unforgettable wonder of the world.

           Sir/Ma’am
          </p>
          <p>
           Through the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I would like to draw the attention of the common masses to the waste of food that happens in Indian weddings. It is not unknown to us that weddings in India have become more extravagant in recent years. It is strange how Indians spend their life’s j savings on their weddings. One of the main features of the lavish wedding is the various types of food one can find there. Today, no wedding is complete without different cuisines offered to the guests.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is quite shocking that on the one hand, India is a host to one of the biggest armies of starving people in the world, on the other, we witness a large-scale wastage of food.
          </p>
          <p>
           Such wastage can be monitored if the size of the servings is limited. Moreover, the host should be responsible for giving the caterers, the exact number of the expected guest list. Moreover, the guests should confirm their presence so that the food is prepared accordingly and there is no wastage. Further, the leftover food can be distributed to the poor to avoid the wastage.
          </p>
          <p>
           I hope my letter will awaken the people and they will try to minimize the wastage in future.
          </p>
          <p>
           Thanking you
          </p>

           This is to inform you that I, am PQR a student of your prestigious school. The purpose of writing this letter is to request you to arrange co-curricular activities at regular intervals.
          </p>
          <p>
           While I agree that education should be our primary focus in college, it is also not wrong to point out that too much focus on academics has made many students stressed. Plaving nothing to entertain us during the college hours makes our day dull and after some point, all studies become ineffective. Hence, I request you to introduce some co-curricular activities at regular time intervals so that we can refresh our minds and then study effectively.

           Kindly understand and oblidge.

           (a) Junk the Fast Food: Choose Health and Happiness -By Anita
           <br/>
           Fast food, with its tantalizing tastes and convenience, has become an integral part of our modern lives. However, as Anita discovered through her doctor’s words, the consequences of indulging in it can be more devastating than we might think.
           <br/>
           Fast food, typically characterized by high levels of salt, sugar, unhealthy fats, and low nutritional value, poses significant risks to our health. Regular consumption can lead to obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and a host of other health problems.
           <br/>
           But there’s hope. Anita’s decision to renounce fast food serves as an inspiring example for us all. In its place, we can opt for healthier alternatives like homemade meals, salads, and fresh fruits. These not only taste great but also nourish our bodies.
           <br/>
           The benefits of bidding farewell to fast food are immense. Improved health, increased energy levels, and a longer, happier life await those who make the switch. Anita’s commitment to raising awareness about this issue is commendable, as it encourages us all to make informed choices.
           <br/>
           In conclusion, let’s join Anita in her mission to “Junk the Fast Food.” It’s a small step for our taste buds but a giant leap for our well-being.

           (b) “Blooming Connections: The Vital Role of Community Gardens in Urban Areas” -By Rohini
           <br/>
           In the bustling heart of urban landscapes, community gardens have emerged as sanctuaries of green tranquillity, where the essence of sustainability and human connection thrive. Bhopal, like many cities, has witnessed the resurgence of community gardens, and their importance cannot be overstated.
           <br/>
           Firstly, community gardens empower urban residents to reconnect with nature. Amidst the concrete jungles, these pockets of green serve as havens, offering a respite from the daily grind. Tending to plants, nurturing seedlings, and watching them flourish provide a profound sense of serenity and reconnection with the earth.
           <br/>
           Secondly, these gardens offer a solution to food security issues. Residents can grow their organic produce, reducing their reliance on mass-produced, often less nutritious options. This not only promotes healthier lifestyles but also fosters a sense of self-reliance and empowerment.
           <br/>
           Moreover, community gardens are catalysts for building relationships. They bring together diverse individuals who share a common love for gardening.
           <br/>
           Neighbors become friends as they swap gardening tips and share their harvests, fostering a close-knit, supportive community.
           <br/>
           In conclusion, community gardens in urban areas like Bhopal are much more than plots of land; they are green lungs, food providers, and hubs of connection. They remind us that amidst the urban rush, nature, and meaningful relationships can thrive if we nurture them.

           <br/>
           Answer Any Five of the following six questions in about 30-40 words each. (5 × 2 = 10)
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) Why did Ali go daily to the Post Office early in the morning? (The Letter) (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Ali regularly went to the Post Office early in the morning with the hope of receiving a letter from his only daughter Miriam. She was married and had left his house five years ago. She had not come even once to meet Ali. So, Ali expected a letter from her.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) In his sonnet, Not Marble, Nor the Gilded Monuments what does the poet say about the vanity of rich men? (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The poet says that rich men try to get their statues erected and monuments made so that they would be remembered forever, but none of these survive the ravages of time and the men are forgotten.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Why did the news of the ‘Miracle Recovery’ shock Michael? (Virtually True) (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Michael was shocked after reading the ‘Miracle Recovery’ story because the name of the person who recovered was Sebastian Shultz whom he thought he knew. He had been playing his games with a person with the same name and thought everything was real.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) Why did Calpurnia try to prevent Caesar from going to the Senate House? Did she succeed in her attempt? (Julius Caesar) (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Calpurnia prevented Caesar from going to the Senate House because she feared something miserable would happen to him. She felt this because of her dream in which she saw Caesar’s statue with many spots, from which blood was oozing out.
           <br/>
           No, she did not succeed because Decius Brutus very cunningly convinced Caesar to go to the Senate House.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) What impression do you form of the sculptor through his work? (Ozymandias) (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The colossal statue of Ozymandias gives a clear indication of the sculptor’s skill. He had very beautifully carved out every detail of the king’s face. Even when the statue was lying in ruins, one could not easily make out the arrogant expression on it.
          </p>
          <p>
           (vi) State one aspect that might have led the narrator to think that the boys must be saving to emigrate to America. (Two Gentlemen of Verona) (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The narrator thinks that the boys must be saving to emigrate to America because the boys did a lot of work. They not only sold fruits and newspapers but also worked as shoeshine boys, tourist guides, and errand boys.

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Answer ANY ONE of the following two questions in about 150 words. [8]
           <br/>
           (A) Henry, I’ve been thinking about that bureau of grandfather’s that’s in his bedroom. You know I always wanted to have it after he died. Victoria is deeply anguished at her mother’s remark. As Victoria write a letter to a friend expressing your feelings on how your mother is behaving in a greedy manner highlighting the values her mother should have possessed.
           <br/>
           (Dear Departed)
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           (B) The Frog and the Nightingale” is a poem written by Vikram Seth, while ‘Snake1 is a poem written by D.H. Lawrence. These two poems are distinct works by different authors and belong to different literary traditions, but they do share some thematic similarities, particularly in their exploration of the relationship between nature and human intervention. Bring out two points of similarity between these two poems.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (A) Dear Jeanette
           <br/>
           I am very upset today as I saw my mother, whom I take to be my ideal, behave irresponsibly. It was a difficult time for us as we believed that my grandfather was dead. But instead of being upset, my parents especially my mother were busy pinching his things. She wanted the bureau in his room, and the clock, and has already passed on grandfather’s slippers to my father. I was rather shocked at this behavior of hers and am unable to believe their reaction. I was saddened by this. I had never thought even in my dreams about such a reaction by my parents.
           <br/>
           I think they should behave responsibly. They should have felt sorrow that a soul had departed and should have shown respect to that departed soul. I wish I could convey my thoughts to my parents, but I know they will not listen to me. My heart feels lightened after sharing my thoughts and emotions with you.
           <br/>
           Yours sincerely
           <br/>
           Victoria
          </p>
          <p>
           OR
          </p>
          <p>
           (B) The point of similarities between, The Frog and the Nightingale and Snake can be brought by referring to the following:
           <br/>
           1. Nature and the Natural World: Both poems focus on the natural world and its inhabitants. ‘The Frog and the Nightingale’ features a frog and a nightingale, while ‘Snake’ centers on a snake. The poets use vivid descriptions and sensory imagery to bring these creatures and their environments to life.
           <br/>
           2. Human Intervention: Both poems touch upon the theme of human intervention in the natural world. In ‘The Frog and the Nightingale,’ the frog’s manipulation of the nightingale’s talent serves as a metaphor for exploitation and commercialization. In ‘Snake,’ the speaker must decide whether to allow the snake to drink from his water trough, highlighting the human tendency to impose our will on nature.
           <br/>
           While these thematic similarities exist, it’s important to note that the two poems have distinct styles, tones, and messages. Vikram Seth’s ‘The Frog and the Nightingale’ is a fable-like poem with a moral lesson, whereas D.H. Lawrence’s ‘Snake’ is a more introspective and complex exploration of humans and instincts.
