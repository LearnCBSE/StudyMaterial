            Bone marrow transplantation.
           </li>
           <li>
            Gene therapy (not permanent cure).
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Why do children cured by enzyme replacement therapy for adenosine deaminase deficiency need periodic treatment? (All India 2015)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Children cured by enzyme replacement therapy for adenosine deaminase deficiency need periodic treatment because in such type of treatment genetically engineered lymphocytes are used and these cells are mortal.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 6.
           <br/>
           State the role of C-peptide in human insulin. (All India 2014)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The C-peptide is an extra stretch of the peptides that connect the A and B-polypeptide chains of insulin in prohormone. During processing to release mature and functional insulin, this C-peptide is removed.

           Name the source used to produce hapatitis-B vaccine using rDNA technology. (Delhi 2015C)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The source of hepatitis-B vaccine is yeast. Recombinant DNA technology has allowed the production of antigenic polypeptides of pathogen in bacteria or yeast. Vaccines produced using this approach allow large scale production and hence greater availability for immunisation.

           Question 12.
           <br/>
           Write the functions of
           <br/>
           (i) cry IAc gene
           <br/>
           (ii) RNA interference (RNAi) (Outside Delhi 2015C)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) cry IAc codes for toxic insecticidal protein as inactive protoxins in Bacillus thuringiensis. This toxin kills the cotton bollworm.
           <br/>
           (ii) RNA interference is associated with silencing of specific ntRNA and is a method of cellular defence in eukaryotes.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 13.
           <br/>
           What is gene therapy? Name the first clinical case in which it was used. (Delhi 2014)
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Name the disease that was first to get the gene therapy treatment. Write the cause of the disease and the effect it has on the patient. (Delhi 2014C, 2013)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Gene therapy is a corrective therapy or technique of genetic engineering that is used to replace a faulty or non-functional gene with a normal healthy functional gene.
          </p>
          <p>
           The first clinical gene therapy was given to a 4 year old girl with ADA (Adenosine Deaminase) deficiency in 1990. It is caused due to the deletion of the gene coding for ADA, which adversely . affects the functioning of imnune system.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 14.
           <br/>
           Why does Bt toxin not kill the bacterium that produces it, but kills the insect that ingests it? (Delhi 2014)
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Why do the toxic insecticidal proteins secreted by Bacillus thuringiensis kill the insect and not the bacteria itself? (Foreign 2010)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Bt toxin does not kill bacteria because in bacteria it exists in inactive state.
           <br/>
           When Bt toxin is ingested by an insect, it gets converted into its active form due to the alkaline pH of the gut.
           <br/>
           The activated toxin binds to the surface of the epithelial cells of the midgut and creates pores. Water enters through these pores and causes swelling and lysis of cells in insect body.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 15.
           <br/>
           Explain how Eli Lilly, an American company, produced insulin by recombinant DNA technology. (Foreign 2014)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Steps involved in insulin production by Eli Lilly company are as follows
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            DNA sequences corresponding to the two polypeptide, A and B-chains of insulin were synthesised in vitro.
           </li>
           <li>
            They were introduced into plasmid DNA of E. coli.
           </li>
           <li>
            This bacterium was cloned under suitable conditions.
           </li>
           <li>
            The transgene was expressed in the form of polypeptides A and B, secreted into the medium.
           </li>
           <li>
            They were extracted and combined by creating disulphide bridge to form human insulin.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Question 16.
           <br/>
           What do ‘cry genes’ in Bacillus thuringiensis code for? State its importance for cotton crop. (All India 2014C)
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Name the soil bacterium that produces a protein/chemical that is toxic to insect pests. Show with example that these are encoded by different forms of the genes. (All India 2012)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           ‘cry genes’ in Bacillus thuringiensis code for toxic insecticidal proteins called Cry proteins which are encoded by different forms of a gene called cry gene, e.g. cry IAc and cry II Ab control the cotton bollworm whereas cry IAb controls corn borer.
          </p>
          <p>
           Cry proteins when expressed in cotton crops through genetic engineering confer pest resistance against cotton bollworms and prevent damage. As the larva of these insects when feed upon cotton plant parts, the toxin gets activated in their gut, lysing their cells and leads to death thus, making them pest resistant.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
           Question 17.
           <br/>
           Human insulin when synthesised in the body needs to be processed before it can act. Explain giving reasons. (Delhi 2014C)
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Why is proinsulin so called? How is proinsulin different from functional insulin in humans? (All India 2013, 2012C)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Human insulin when initially synthesised in human body consists of three peptide chains-A, B and C. The C-peptide is an extra stretch of amino acids joining the A and B-chains. This is called proinsulin or prohormone. It undergoes processing or splicing to release the functional mature insulin that can carry out its normal functions.
           <br/>
           During processing, the C-peptide is removed. Only A and B-chains contribute to form the functional insulin.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The genetically modified plants are found to be useful as they
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            reduce or minimise the use of agrochemicals, i.e. fertilisers, insecticides, herbicides, etc.
           </li>
           <li>

           (i) State the role of DNA ligase in biotechnology.
           <br/>
           (ii) What happens when Meloidogyne incognita consumes cells with RNAi gene? (Delhi 2012)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) DNA ligase enzyme is used to join two DNA fragments from their ends.
           <br/>
           (ii) When Meloidogyne incognita (parasite) consumes cells with RNA/ gene, parasite cannot survive and the infection is prevented. It is mainly because introduced DNA forms both sense and anti-sense RNA. These two strands being complementary to each other form dsRNA. This dsRNA binds and prevents translation of nematode OTRNA. Thus, the wRNA of nematode is silenced and the parasite cannot survive there. This produces Meloidogyne incognita resistant tobacco plants.

           Question 22.
           <br/>
           Explain how a hereditary disease can be corrected. Give an example of the first successful attempt made towards correction of such disease. (Delhi 2011)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Hereditary disease can be corrected by gene therapy. It is a collection of methods that allow correction or replacement of defective genes. The first gene therapy was given in 1990 to a 4 year old girl with Adenosine Deaminase (ADA) deficiency. It is caused due to the deletion of gene for adenosine deaminase.
           <br/>
           The treatment involves following steps
          </p>
          <ul>

           Question 23.
           <br/>
           How does recombinant DNA technology help in detecting the presence of mutant gene in cancer patients? (All India 2o11c)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A single-stranded DNA or RNA, tagged with a radioactive molecule (probe) is allowed to hybridise with its complementary DNA in a clone of cells followed by detection using
           <br/>
           autoradiography. The clone having the mutated gene will not appear on photographic film, because probe will not be complementary with mutated gene thus, helpful in defecting the presence of mutated gene in cancer patients.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 24.
           <br/>
           Why is the introduction of genetically engineered lymphocytes into an ADA deficiency patient not a permanent cure? Suggest a possible permanent cure. (Delhi 2010)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The genetically engineered lymphocytes have a definite lifespan. Hence, the patient requires periodic infusion of genetically engineered lymphocytes, so the cure is not permanent. The cure can be permanent, if the gene isolated from marrow cells producing ADA is introduced into the cells at early embryonic stages.

           Question 27.
           <br/>
           How has the use of Agrobacterium as vectors helped in controlling Meloidogyne incognita infestation in tobacco plants? Explain in correct sequence. (2018)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Several nematodes infect a wide variety of plants and animals including human beings.
           <br/>
           A nematode Meloidogyne incognita infects the roots of tobacco plants which reduces the production of tobacco.
           <br/>
           The strategy adopted to prevent this infection is based on the process of RNA interference (RNAi). RNA; mechanism takes place in all eukaryotic organisms as a method of cellular defence.
          </p>
          <p>
           This method involves the following steps
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Silencing of a specific mRNA due to the complementary dsRNA molecule that binds to and prevents translation of the mRNA.
           </li>
           <li>
            Agrobacterium vectors are used to introduce nematode specific genes into the host plant. It produces both sense and antisense RNA in the host cells.
           </li>
           <li>
            These two RNAs are complementary to each other and form a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that initiates RNAi and hence, silence the specific mRNA of the nematode.
           </li>
           <li>
            The parasite cannot survive in a transgenic host, therefore the transgenic plant gets itself protected from the parasite.

           Explain the application of rDNA technology to produce insulin. (Delhi 2015C)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Bt cotton plants are the transgenic plants that express a Bacillus thuringiensis gene called cry gene. This gene, encodes for protein crystals having insecticidal properties against insects of group Lepidoptera, Diptera and Coleoptera. Inside the bacterium, these proteins remain inactive and do not harm the bacteria. However, these inactive crystals can get activated in the alkaline pH of the gut of insects upon ingestion.
          </p>
          <p>
           After activation, these crystals can bind to the receptors present on the membranes of gut epithelial cells. Due to this binding, the membrane swells and pores are created on them. These pores lead to bursting of cell and soon the lepidopteran dies due to starvation.

           The plants, bacteria, fungi and animals whose
           <br/>
           genes have been altered are called Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). GM plants are useful in many ways.
           <br/>
           Genetic modification has done the following changes to the phenotypic expression of the plants,

           Name the genes responsible for making Bt cotton plants resistant to bollworm attack. How do such plants attain resistance against bollworm attacks? Explain. (Delhi 2012)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Biotechnology had hepled in generating plant varieties against the pests that destroy the cotton balls, i.e. cotton bollworms and cotton borer.
           <br/>
           Bt cotton is created by using some strains of a bacterium. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt is short form).
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            This bacterium produces protein that kills certain insects such as lepidopterans (tobacco budworm and armyworm), coleopterans (beetles) and dipterans (flies and mosquitoes).
           </li>
           <li>
            Bacillus thuringiensis forms protein crystals during a particular phase of their growth. These crystals contain a toxic insecticidal protein.
           </li>
           <li>
            Bt toxin protein exists as inactive protoxin in bacteria, but once an insect ingests this inactive toxin, it is converted into an active form due to the alkaline pH of the gut, which solubilises the crystals.
           </li>
           <li>
            The activated toxin binds to the surface of midgut epithelial cells and creates pores that cause cell swelling and lysis leading to death of insect.
           </li>
           <li>
            Specific Bt toxin genes were isolated from Bacillus thuringiensis and incorporated into several crop plants.
           </li>
           <li>
            Most Bt toxins are insect-group specific. The toxin is coded by a gene named cry. For example, the proteins encoded by the genes cry IAc and cry IIAb control the cotton bollworms and cry IAb controls corn borer.

           Question 33.
           <br/>
           Why is molecular diagnosis preferred over conventional methods? Name any two techniques giving one use of each. (Delhi 2016C)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Using conventional methods of diagnosis (serum and urine analysis), early detection of diseases is not possible. To overcome this problem, some molecular diagnosis techniques were developed that provide early detection of diseases. These are as follows
           <br/>
           (i) Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) helps in early detection of diseases or pathogens by the amplification of their nucleic acid.
           <br/>
           PCR can amplify nucleic acids of pathogens even when their concentration is very low.
           <br/>
           This technique can be used for detecting HIV in suspected AIDS patients, genetic mutations in suspected cancer patients and in identifying genetic disorders.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) is based on the principle of antigen-antibody interaction. Infection by pathogen can be detected by the presence of antigens (proteins, glycoproteins, etc.) or by detecting the antibodies synthesised against the pathogen.
          </p>

           Question 34.
           <br/>
           How has RNAi technique helped to prevent the infestation of roots in tobacco plants by a nematode Meloidogync incognita? (Delhi 2016)
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           How did the process of RNA interference help to control the nematode from infecting the roots of tobacco plants. (Foreign 2014)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A nematode Meloidogyne incognita infects the roots of tobacco plants, which reduces the production of tobacco. The strategy adopted to prevent this infection is based on the process of RNA interference (RNAf). RNAi takes place in all eukaryotic organisms as a method of cellular defence. This method involves silencing of a specific mRNA due to complementary rfsRNA molecule that binds to and prevents translation of mRNA.
           <br/>
           Thus, resulting into the death of the nematode.

           Name the host plant and its part that Meloidogyne incognita infects. Explain the role of Agrobacterium in the production of dsRNA in the host plant. (Delhi 2014C)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The nematode Meloidogyne incognita infects the roots of tobacco plants.
           <br/>
           The Agrobacterium is used as vectors carrying nematode specific genes to be introduced in host plant. These genes when expressed inside host plant produce sense and anti-sense RNA strands, complementary to nematode’s functional mRNA. This binding results in the formation of double-stranded RNA and inhibiting or silencing the translation of RNA specified. This process is called RNA interference.
