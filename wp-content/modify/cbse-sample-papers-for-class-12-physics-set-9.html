           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When the input voltage is equal to or less than 5 V, diode will be reverse biased. It will offer high resistance in comparison to resistance (R) in series. Now, diode appears in open circuit. The input /waveform is then passed to the output terminals. The result with sine wave input is to dip off all positive going portion above 5 V.
          </p>
          <p>
           If input voltage is more than + 5 V, diode will be conducting as if forward biased offering low resistance in comparison to R. But there will be no voltage in output beyond 5 V as the voltage beyond + 5 V will appear across R.
          </p>
          <p>
           When input voltage is negative, if there will be opposition to 5 V battery. In p-n junction, if input voltage becomes more than – 5 V, the diode will be reverse biased. It will offer high resistance in comparison to resistance R in series. Now, junction diode appears in open circuit. The input waveform is then passed on to the output terminals.
           <br/>
           The output waveform is shown here in the figure

           (i) Resistivity of a conductor is given by ρ =
           <br/>
           (a) Resistivity ρ ∝ \(\frac{1}{n}\), where n is the number density of free electrons.

           Question 21.
           <br/>
           Show that spherical mirror formula is applicable to a plane mirror. [2]
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           An infinitely long rod lies along the axis of concave mirror of focal length f. The near end of the rod is at a distance x &gt; f from the mirror f, then what will be the length of the image of the rod? [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The spherical mirror formula is given by
           <br/>
           \(\frac{1}{u}\) + \(\frac{1}{v}\) = \(\frac{1}{f}\) ………(i)
           <br/>
           For a plane mirror, R = ∞
           <br/>
           ∴ f = \(\frac{R}{2}\) = ∞
           <br/>
           From Eq. (i), we get
           <br/>
           \(\frac{1}{u}\) + \(\frac{1}{v}\) = \(\frac{1}{∞}\) = 0
           <br/>
           ⇒ \(\frac{1}{v}\) = latex]\frac{-1}{u}[/latex] ⇒ V = -u
           <br/>
           As, u is negative, v becomes positive.
           <br/>
           Thus, image is formed behind the mirror at the same distance as the object is in front of it. This happens in a plane mirror and hence, spherical mirror formula is applicable to plane mirror.
           <br/>
           Also, note that magnification, m = \(-\frac{v}{u}\) is 1.
          </p>
          <p>
           Or
          </p>
          <p>
           Using mirror formula,
           <br/>
           \(\frac{1}{f}\) = \(\frac{1}{v}\) + \(\frac{1}{u}\)
           <br/>
           Here,
           <br/>
           ⇒ u = -u, v = ?, f = -f
           <br/>
           \(-\frac{1}{f}\) = \(\frac{1}{v}\) – \(\frac{1}{u}\)
           <br/>
           or \(\frac{1}{v}\) = \(\frac{1}{-f}\) + \(\frac{1}{u}\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ v = \(\frac{-f u}{-f+u}\)
           <br/>
           Length of the image = \(\frac{-f u}{-f+u}\) – f
           <br/>
           = \(\frac{f u+f^2-f u}{-f+u}\) = \(\frac{f^2}{u-f}\)

           Question 22.
           <br/>
           If both the number of protons and neutrons are conserved in a nuclear reaction like
           <br/>
           \({ }_6 \mathrm{C}^{12}\) + \({ }_6 \mathrm{C}^{12}\) → \({ }_{10} \mathrm{Ne}^{20}\) + \({ }_2 \mathrm{He}^4\)
           <br/>
           In what way is the mass converted into energy? Explain. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The sum of masses of nuclei of product element is less than sum of masses of reactants and hence, loss of mass takes place during the reaction. This difference of mass of product element and reactant is converted into energy and liberated in the form of heat.
           <br/>
           Here, sum of masses of \({ }_{10} \mathrm{Ne}^{20}\) and \({ }_2 \mathrm{He}^4\) is less than the sum of two \({ }_6 \mathrm{C}^{12}\) and conversion of this mass defect is used to produce energy.

           Question 23.
           <br/>
           Use Gauss’ law to derive the expression for the electric field between two uniformly charged parallel sheets with surface charge densities σ and -σ, respectively. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Let us consider two uniformly charge parallel sheets carrying surface charge densities + σ and – σ respectively and are separated by a small distance from each other.
          </p>
          <p>
           By Gauss’ law, it can be proved that, electric field intensity due to a uniformly charged infinite plane
           <br/>
           sheet as nearby is given by E = \(\frac{\sigma}{2 \varepsilon_0}\)
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 12 Physics Set 9 with Solutions 13" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-156806" height="173" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-12-Physics-Set-9-with-Solutions-13.png" width="133"/>
           <br/>
           The electric field is directed normally outward from the plane sheet, if nature of charge on sheet is positive and normally inward, if charge is of negative nature. Let \(\hat{r}\) represents unit vector directed from positive plate to negative plate.
           <br/>
           Now, electric field intensity (EFI) at any point P between the two plates is given by
           <br/>
           (i) E
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           = + \(\frac{\sigma}{2 \varepsilon_0}\) \(\hat{r}\) [due to positive plate]
           <br/>
           (ii) E
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           = + \(\frac{\sigma}{2 \varepsilon_0}\) \(\hat{r}\) [due to negative plate]
           <br/>
           ∴ New EFI at point P,
           <br/>
           E = E
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           + E
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           = \(\frac{\sigma}{2 \varepsilon_0}\) \(\hat{r}\) + \(\frac{\sigma}{2 \varepsilon_0}\) \(\hat{r}\) = \(\frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_0}\) \(\hat{r}\)
           <br/>
           Thus, uniform electric field is produced between the two infinite parallel plane sheet of charge which is directed from positive plate to negative plate.

           ϕ = B∆S = Bly
           <br/>
           The rate of change of magnetic flux linked with the coil is given by
           <br/>
           \(\frac{d \phi}{d t}\) = \(\frac{d}{d t}\) (Blv)
           <br/>
           = Bl \(\frac{d y}{d t}\) = Blv
           <br/>
           where, v is the velocity with which the coil is pulled out of the magnetic field.
           <br/>
           If e is the induced emf, then according to Faraday’s law,
           <br/>
           e = – \(\frac{d \phi}{d t}\) or e = – Blv
           <br/>
           From Fleming’s right hand rule, the current due to induced emf will flow from the end R toQ, i.e. along SROP in the coil. This induced electromotive force (emf) Blv is called motional emf.

           (i) (a) The ray diagram for the formation of the image of the mobile phone is shown below. The image of the part which is on the plane perpendicular to principal axis will be on the same plane. It will be of the same size only at C.
           <br/>
           i.e., B’C = BC.
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 12 Physics Set 9 with Solutions 18" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-156812" height="128" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-12-Physics-Set-9-with-Solutions-18.png" width="175"/>
           <br/>
           Here, magnification of each part of the mobile phone can’t be uniform due to different locations of phone.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) We may think that the image will now show only half of the object, but considering the laws of reflection to be true for all points of the remaining part of the mirror, the image will be that of the whole object.
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 12 Physics Set 9 with Solutions 19" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-156813" height="154" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-12-Physics-Set-9-with-Solutions-19.png" width="238"/>
           <br/>
           However, as the area of the reflecting surface has been reduced, the intensity of the image will be low, i.e. half.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) (a) The rays of light travelling parallel to the principal axis, after reflection from a concave mirror meet at a single point only, If the beam of light is narrow or if the mirror is of small aperture. In case, a wide beam of light falls on a concave mirror of large aperture, the rays after reflection from the mirror do not come to focus at a single point. Therefore, it follows that, if the aperture of the concave mirror is small, the image formed will be sharper.

           Two metal spheres, one of radius R and the other of radius 2R, both have same surface charge density a. They are brought in contact and separated. What will be new surface charge densities on them? [5]

           Answer:
           <br/>
           Radius of sphere A = R
           <br/>
           Surface charge density on sphere A = σ
           <br/>
           Radius of sphere B = 2R
           <br/>
           Surface charge density on sphere B = a

           Let after the contact, the charge on A be Q’

           and the charge on B be Q’

           .
           <br/>
           According to the conservation of charge, the charge before contact is equal to charge after contact.

           As they are in contact, so they have same potential.
