           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the following text. [10 Marks]
           <br/>
           1. Hiking is a great source of pleasure to us besides being beneficial for our health. Once we leave the crowded streets of a city and go out for a walking tour away from the mad world, we feel free. The open air has a bracing effect on the mind. The congestion of the city, the uproar and tumult, the intolerable noise of traffic, the hectic daily routine, all these are forgotten and the mind is at ease. We then feel like running, leaping, singing, and laughing. We travel merrily mile after mile in the company of friends and associates.
           <br/>
           2. Hiking takes us amid nature. The sight of waterfalls, flowers, streams, trees, and bushes is pleasing. A connection is established between us and nature. (Various sounds of nature, like the murmur of a brook or the song of a bird, acquire a new meaning and significance to us.)
           <br/>
           3. You enjoy the beauty of nature. Minute observations like a snake casting its slough, a mouse peeping out of its hole, a squirrel leaping about on the branches of a tree, a bird flying past us, all these are noticed and they arouse our interest. We have no business worries, no fear of the examination, no anxiety about the home. We have leisure to stand, to walk, and talk. It is more thrilling and pleasurable to hike in a mountainous region than in the plains. The excitement of climbing up to the top of a hill, the adventure of coming down a slope, the grandeur of sunset behind a mountain – All these sights lend a rare charm and interest to our journey.
           <br/>
           4. We walk along a zigzag motor road or cut across a mountain path in search of adventure. We may have bright sunny weather or might get caught in a shower of rain. We may look below us into the yawning chasm or up at the mountain peak. The feeling of unlimited freedom makes our hearts leap with joy.
           <br/>
           5. Hiking is one of the healthiest sports. It ensures a complete escape from the urgent and busy activities of life and therefore gives solace to our brain. It regains its lost energy and can do twice as much work as before.
           <br/>
           6. The fresh air, beautiful mountains, majestic trees, and chirping sound of birds make one’s mind and soul at peace with nature.
          </p>

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Read the following text. (10)
           <br/>
           1. Celebrities advertising products is nothing new it has been part of our lives for years. Back in the 2000s, you couldn’t sit through a commercial break without seeing the teen pop icon of that time, Britney Spears, endorsing Pepsi. The Pepsi legacy was later continued by the most celebrity Beyonce. She was paid millions to promote the carbonated drink, which outraged health advocacy groups. Many concerned people questioned her ethics, as to why she was supporting a drink that plays a major role in causing obesity.
          </p>
          <p>
           2. With the growing importance of social media in a shopper’s purchase journey, companies are evolving and stepping up the endorsement game across different channels. With celebrities vouching for promoting their products, brands can increase awareness, trust, and familiarity, which are important variables in the purchase decision-making process.
          </p>
          <p>
           3. Consumers feel more sympathetic towards a brand if their products are promoted by a celebrity they admire or relate to. It’s a simple psychological effect: people believe that purchasing a product that’s promoted by a celebrity they admire, will allow them to emulate the celebrity’s desired traits or attract similar people into their lives. They will associate the celebrities’ success, beauty, athletic skill, etc. with a particular product.
          </p>
          <p>
           4. Research by Nielson conducted in 2015 broke down the level of trust in advertising formats by different generations. It found that celebrity endorsements resonate more strongly with Generation Z (ages 15 – 20) and Millennial (ages 21 – 34) audiences. Brands are taking advantage of that by increasingly utilizing the social media communities of celebrities. Social media is a way for consumers, in particular, those of younger demographics, to engage and build Intimate connections with the celebrities they follow, making it the place for these celebrities to plug a company or a product on their personal social media accounts.
          </p>
          <p>
           5. While celebrity endorsements certainly help to attract consumers, their direct influence on the consumers’ purchasing decisions is inconclusive. As consumers are becoming better educated and have faster access to information, blind faith in celebrity endorsement is beginning to wane. They will be attracted to a brand because of a celebrity but they will quickly move away if the product does not perform. It’s the quality of your product that will keep consumers coming back, not a celebrity link.
          </p>
          <p>
           6. A brand needs to tell the consumer why a product makes sense for them as individuals and what problem they can solve with it, not solely rely on a real-life Barbie doll, athlete or pop-culture icon. If they can’t, their products will lose value over time and consumers will be the first ones to turn their backs.

           Subject : Request to organise Traffic Rules Awareness Drive.
          </p>
          <p>
           Sir/Ma’am
           <br/>
           Through this letter, I, a concerned citizen of Lucknow wish to bring your attention to the rising indifference among the riders of our city towards road safety and awareness of traffic rules. Recently, I came across several posters of an extremely hazardous event being organised in the city for motorbike and car racing. Such events have become a major problem in Lucknow. The lives of thousands of riders, bystanders and pedestrians are endangered by the irresponsible behaviour of the careless riders who participate in such events.
          </p>
          <p>
           Such events are mainly organised in the Gomti Nagar area by some local mechanic shops.In these events several bike riders are seen racing their vehicles, jeopardising many lives. We can also witness an increasing trend of over-speeding in almost all areas of the city.
          </p>
          <p>
           The problem does not end with over-speeding. Many teenagers below the age of 18 are driving their parents’ vehicles without a valid driver’s licence. Also, no use of the traffic signals and signal timers is seen despite the installation of CCTV cameras in the areas.
          </p>
          <p>
           Thus, there is a pressing need to educate the riders of the city and make them aware of traffic rules and stop such events from being organised.

           Subject : Creating Awareness towards Health and Hygiene
          </p>
          <p>
           Sir/Ma’am
           <br/>
           Through the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I wish to draw the attention of the concerned authorities towards the negligent attitude of people towards basic health and hygiene. Recently, I participated in a Health camp in a remote village near Delhi. There I was surprised to find that the villagers are not paying any attention to sanitation and personal hygiene which is leading them to ill health. They had no idea regarding the various basic hygiene practices that will promote good health. Their condition is despairing and in need of immediate attention. This problem can be overcome by organising Health Camps in these areas where we can make these villagers aware of the importance of a healthy lifestyle by employing discussions or health checkups by specialists.
           <br/>
           A small dispensary can also be set up there for their routine check-up. They must be taught that cleanliness is next to godliness. Youngsters can volunteer to create awareness amongst the downtrodden. A little effort on our part will save these villagers from contracting serious diseases.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Saving the Endangered Species
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Maintaining a balance in the ecosystem is of paramount importance for a sustainable environment. The environment must be preserved and conserved so that we can continue benefitting from it. Within the ecosystem, it is equally important to take care of and preserve the flora and fauna. However, today, the environment and its flora and fauna is being degraded by the activities of humans and this has led to the extinction of many species.
           <br/>
           Human activities like poaching and hunting of wild animals are one of the major causes of the extinction of many species, including the tiger, the national animal of India. Increasing human population has led to an increase in the number of houses required and in turn, this has led to deforestation to make way for more construction. However, this also reduces the natural habitat available for the animals to live and survive in, leading to their extinction. Further, climate change is also making the natural environment unfriendly for many animal species to thrive in.
           <br/>
           To maintain a balance in the ecosystem, it is very important to preserve and conserve the various species. This can be done by ensuring that enough actions are taken to conserve and protect the natural habitat of these animals and avoid deforestation. The government must put into action strict laws and policies that make hunting and poaching of animals a punishable offense.
           <br/>
           Efforts by humans and governments can go a long way in maintaining a healthy ecosystem.

           (B) A survey was conducted by your school on how many children walk down to school, how many use their transport, how many use the school bus, and how many come in private vans. The findings are given below.
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 10 English Set 3 with Solutions 1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-131172" height="426" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learninsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-English-Set-3-with-Solutions-1-2.png" width="459"/>
           <br/>
           Based on the pie-chart given above write a paragraph analyzing the information on ‘Preference of Private vans to school buses’. Think of reasons for this preference by some parents is it more convenient and safer. (100-120 words) [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Preference of Private Vans to School Buses
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Commuting to and from school is an activity that is a major consideration for many parents. Whenever a student has to join school, their commuting is a major concern for almost all parents. These days, many schools provide school vans for the transportation of students safely and soundly. Some parents also consider dropping and picking children on their own.
           <br/>
           A recent survey highlighted the fact that most parents prefer private vans to school buses. Almost 30% of students commute using private vans and an equal number use school buses. But with the number of school buses that schools make available, this number is very low. Many parents consider private vans to be safer as compared to school buses. Many parents think that the condition of private vans is much better than school buses and therefore they prefer sending their children in private vans. Moreover, private van owners also provide many facilities that school buses do not. This makes the parents opt for private vans. Many parents are also observed comparing drivers of private vans and school buses and concluding that private van drivers drive better and in a much safer manner and follow traffic rules as opposed to school buses. Private vans also pick up and drop students at their doorsteps which may not be the case in school buses. This makes private vans a more convenient option and therefore a preferred mode of transport.

           B. It was only when I began to learn that my boyhood freedom was an illusion when I discovered as a young man that my freedom had already been taken from me, that I began to hunger for it.
           <br/>
           At first, as a student, I wanted freedom only for myself, the transitory freedoms of being able to stay out at night, read what I pleased and go where I chose. Later, as a young man in Johannesburg, I yearned for the basic and honourable freedoms of achieving my potential, of earning my keep, of marrying and having a family — the freedom not to be obstructed in a lawful life.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The speaker mentions some freedoms as transitory because the freedoms we enjoy are momentary and keep changing with time. He had different perceptions of freedom at different stages of his life.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) From where does the speaker’s hunger for freedom begin? (1)

           Custard, the dragon is teased as Percival by Ink, Blink, and Mustard for his timidity. They teased him as Percival because, unlike Custard, he was a courageous knight of King Arthur.
           <br/>
           Custard on the other hand, was meek and always cried for a nice safe cage.

           Question 9.
           <br/>
           (A) What were the factors which contributed in making Ebright a scientist?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Richard Ebright had some innate character traits that are the prerequisites for the making of a scientist. He had, besides an intelligent mind, the curiosity to seek information, keen observing powers, perseverance, patience as well as self-discipline, which are the basic requirements for any scientific research. And the credit also goes to his mother for recognizing his inclinations and curiosity. She not only encouraged and supported him but also provided the required stimulus through books and other materials.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Dr. Herriot was shocked to see Tricki’s condition. He knew that the latter would soon be hospitalized as he was unable to move. He had become hugely fat, like a bloated sausage and his tongue lolled from his jaws. He understood the very cause of Tricki’s condition and knew that the situation would not be changing any time soon.

           (C) Why was Matilda Loisel always unhappy?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Matilda Loisel was very pretty. She considered herself to be born for a luxurious life but the reality was different from her dreams. In reality, she was married to a petty clerk and had to lead a very simple life. Her fantasy, over over-ambitiousness, made her unhappy. Matilda’s desire to belong to the affluent section of society was responsible for her downfall. If she had accepted her condition with a smile and without any complaints, she would not have had to live 10 long years of her life in such abject poverty.

           Answer ANY ONE of the following two questions, in about 100 – 120 words. (1 × 6 = 6)
           <br/>
           A. Imagine you are a senior journalist covering this event of the trees moving.
           <br/>
           Pen down a 120-word submission for the weekly newspaper column titled-‘Change’.
           <br/>
           Include a brief account of your observation as well as your opinion.
           <br/>
           You may begin like this
           <br/>
           Sr. Correspondent, The U.S. Chronicle
           <br/>
           It was a movement to behold! The trees….
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           B. You have been asked to present an article on death and suffering. You need to draft this article concerning the teachings of Buddha in ‘The Sermon at Benares’ Draft the article in 100 – 120 words.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A. Change
           <br/>
           Sr. Correspondent, The U.S. Chronicle
          </p>
          <p>
           It was a movement to behold! The trees along with their leaves, twigs, bough, and roots were struggling hard to free themselves. It was a historical movement. Everyone around was perhaps shocked and embarrassed by the sudden and unexpected happenings. It appeared as if every part of the confined trees rose in revolt and struggled hard to free itself. The roots and leaves strived to break free.
          </p>
          <p>
           Small twigs become hard due to overwork. Long cramped boughs were trying to break open the roof and come out. The confined trees put in artificial glass houses wanted to be free. They were shuffling hard to come out in the open as they were suffocated with the limited space available. The fact the trees are revolting shows the urgent need for man to stop.
          </p>
          <p>
           Humans must understand the negative impact of their actions on nature and mend their ways before it is too late. Nature is getting angrier day by day and man’s, existence on this planet is in danger. Thus, it is the foremost duty of every citizen to work for the protection of the environment.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           B. Death and Suffering
          </p>
          <p>
           Death and suffering, as per Buddha, are part and parcel of life. No one in the world can avoid this truth. One certainly has to meet one’s end one day.
          </p>
          <p>
           According to the teachings of Buddha, whoever has come into this world has to die one day.
           <br/>
           Thus, in the hour of grief for a loved one who has died, one must remain calm and composed. If one doesn’t do so, the hour of grief would be more painful to bear. Those persons who are wise never complain or lament over their loss. They never try to bring back their loved ones who are dead, as Gotami wanted to. They accept the truth and this helps in overcoming their sorrow. By overcoming their sorrow, they become blessed. So, wisdom is in the fact that people should not get distressed by pain, suffering, or death.

           Anger Doesn’t Resolve, It Destroys
           <br/>
           By Aradhna X-C
          </p>
          <p>
           Griffin in footprints without feet, sets the house on fire when he was thrown out. He was so angry that he sets fire to this house without giving a single thought to it. His landlord had threatened him to evacuate the house. So he wanted to take revenge on him. But one must realise that anger and revenge are in no way a solution to any problem. It is an old saying that kindness pays, rudeness never. Anger can never resolve any problem. It rather aggravates it. It is always better to keep cool when someone is angry. Despite anger being a healthy and normal emotion, it must be under one’s control. It should not be allowed to escalate, uncontrollable anger leads to high blood pressure and anxiety. Parents are the role models of their children so they should not yell or scream at them. First, they should keep their cool so that the child follows them.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Rajvir had been invited to spend his vacations with his classmate Pranjol, whose father was the manager of a tea estate in Assam. He was quite excited about the trip and had gathered a considerable amount of relevant information, i.e., where tea originated and how it became such a popular beverage. He informed that about 80 crore cups of tea are consumed daily and that the name ‘tea’ itself has originated from the Chinese language. He narrated two popular legends about the origin of tea.
           <br/>
           Rajvir exhibits an important value trait, which is the prerequisite to gaining knowledge – curiosity, and eagerness to know. Moreover, he is not a passive learner but is proactive in collecting prior information to any real experience. He likes to do his homework thoroughly before going to a place. This is something very appreciable and children should develop this habit of finding out about the place they are going to visit. These are extremely desirable traits for all learners.
