          </p>
          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the following text. (10)
           <br/>
           1. The conquest of happiness has meant different facts to different generations. Our forefathers took pride in scholarship, a spirit of sacrifice and solicitude for the welfare of others. Gone are those days. Today we live only for ourselves. We are jealous of the advancement of our neighbours. We end up tense and unhappy.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           2. The term ‘happy’ has a variety of meanings. It stands for the lucky, fortunate, content, glad or apt. Happiness lies within the mind of the individual. No amount of external wealth may be helpful in making him happy.
          </p>
          <p>
           3. Our forefathers had lifestyles, very much different from those we have today. Their life was
           <br/>
           based mainly on the concept of ‘Simple living and high thinking.’ People were satisfied with whatever they obtained after working hard. Excessive material wealth did not mean much for them. They aimed at deriving mental satisfaction and enrichment from whatever they did.
          </p>
          <p>
           4. The structural framework of our forefathers’ families was different from those of ours. They lived in a cohesive joint family structure where they were happier than we. They cared for each other. The siblings grew up with their cousins. The bond qf love which they shared cannot be easily found in the nuclear family of the day. The family provided an emotional cushioning effect against tension and stress. However, in the nuclear family, we are detached from the feelings towards our kith and kin. At times even the cousins do not recognise one another, when they happen to be self-centered- Disputes in the family may lead to divisions. This may finally destroy the family psyche.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           5. The joint family system provided a proper environment for the child to grow up. The value of respect, tolerance, responsibility, integrity, etc. were internalised in the child. In the long run, they became better human beings, compared to those in the present generation. Our forefathers felt happiest if their children became ‘honest’ human beings. But today we are happy only if we attain our coveted material ends. We are ready to resort to any means to attain that end. Our . philosophy of life has turned out totally Machiavellian.
          </p>
          <p>
           6. Our forefathers had a vision to make India the best. To attain their ambitions, they were ready to make all sorts of personal sacrifices. Their happiness lay in that of the millions of Indian brothers and sisters. On the other hand, today people are ready to migrate to the West, to enjoy a comfortable life. They run away from the evils of the Indian society without trying to remedy them. Often they become successful in foreign lands. But in the process, they become alienated from their motherland. The nostalgic feeling of their childhood and the relationship they left lingered on which cannot make them happy. Distance from their ailing parents is a worrying factor and keeps them perturbed. It is not easy for them to return, as their children will not be able to adjust to the Indian environment and the way of life. Thus, in our generation, tradition and modernity have intermingled to form our special system.

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Read the following text. (10)
          </p>
          <p>
           1. The Arctic is warming more than twice as fast as the rest of the world, and some scientists believe that thawing permafrost ground – frozen since the last Ice Age – is about to release enormous amounts of climate-warming emissions. In the coldest regions of planet Earth, ice binds together soil, rock, sand, and organic matter. This layer of permafrost can begin just centimeters below the Earth’s surface. Places anywhere cold enough to keep the ground frozen year-round for at least two years count as permafrost. About a quarter of the Northern Hemisphere contains permafrost.
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 10 English Set 5 with Solutions 1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-102231" height="296" loading="lazy" src="https://www.cbsetuts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-English-Set-5-with-Solutions-1.png" width="346"/>
          </p>
          <p>
           2. Warmer temperatures in the Arctic are causing snow and ice to disappear. As ice covering the sea shrinks back, it exposes darker waters that absorb solar radiation rather than reflecting it back out in the atmosphere. This is called the albedo effect, and it helps explain why the Arctic region is warming so much faster than the rest of the world. This chart shows how much average surface air temperatures have changed at different latitudes since 1960.
          </p>
          <p>
           3. The Siberian Arctic town of Verkhoyansk in June registered a record-high temperature of 38 degrees Celsius (100.4 Fahrenheit) during a prolonged heat wave. Record fires have also engulfed vast swathes of Siberian Russia, emitting more carbon dioxide than Switzerland or Norway in a year.
          </p>
          <p>
           4. The boreal forests of the Arctic have evolved to survive and thrive from occasional fires that would naturally occur every few decades or centuries in the region. But the more recent fires are different, scientists say. They are starting months earlier than they ever have before, and are smoldering through the winter as underground ‘zombie fires.’
          </p>
          <p>
           5. The more intense fires are also burning up peat hogs. A forest might grow back in a few decades and reabsorb the carbon it released when it burned; a peat bog is the accumulation of thousands of years of partial decomposition.
          </p>
          <p>
           6. The best way to prevent permafrost from thawing is to limit climate change by reducing fossil fuel emissions and protecting forests, scientists say. But once permafrost thaws, there’s nothing that can be done to stop the carbon from being released. (Source: The true picture)
          </p>
          <p>
           Answer the following questions, based on the passage above:
           <br/>
           (i) Complete the following analogy appropriately, based on your understanding of paragraphs 1 &amp; 2. We can say that with increasing global temperature the permafrost thaws to release climate-warming emissions which is causing snow and ice to disappear in the Arctic. This is leading to ……………………….
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           ‘Albedo effect’ means as the ice covering the sea shrinks back, it exposes darker waters that absorb radiation rather than reflecting it out in the atmosphere which is why the Arctic region warming much faster than the rest of the world.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Fill in the blanks with the appropriate option from those given in brackets, based on your understanding of paragraph 2.
           <br/>
           The statement that, ‘warmer temperatures in the Arctic are causing snow and ice to disappear’ is a (fact/opinion) because it is exposing the darker waters to …………………… (reflection/ absorption of heat).
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           fact; absorption of heat
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Justify the following, in about 40 words.
           <br/>
           While boreal forests can survive according to the passage, yet the problem of carbon emission can spin off control.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The boreal forests have evolved to survive and thrive on occasional fires which remove the thick forest floor mat of old forests so that new young forests can begin. But if the fires are more intense then they can even start burning peat bogs. Peat bogs generate more carbon emissions while generating very little energy compared to coal. Thus carbon emissions can spin out of control.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) Infer one reason for the following, based on information in the given passage. The Arctic region is warming so much faster than the rest of the world.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           As ice covering the sea shrinks back, it exposes darker waters that absorb solar radiation rather than reflecting it out in the atmosphere causing the Arctic region to warm faster. This is called the albedo effect.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) In the given figure there has been a considerable rise in temperature due to ‘thawing of permafrost’ in the Northern Hemisphere, while the Antarctic region is comparatively much better in keeping the temperature well under the freezing point of water. State one reason for this.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In the southern hemisphere, there’s far less ground to freeze, so the thawing of permafrost is very less compared to North Hemisphere, so with very less possibility of carbon emission due to very less thawing of permafrost the temperature rise is negligible nearer the South Pole. When permafrost is frozen, plant material in soil-called organic carbon can’t decompose, or rot. As permafrost thaws, microbes begin decomposing this material. This process releases greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane to the atmosphere.
          </p>
          <p>

           Subject: Request to employ more constables at the Beatbox
           <br/>
           Sir,
           <br/>
           This is to bring to your kind attention that the police beat box near our locality has very few constables. They often let off people who look suspicious and refuse to work efficiently. The residents face a lot of problems because of this and many cases of robbery have been reported from the resident’s end lately.
          </p>
          <p>
           At times the nearest beatbox doesn’t have anyone who could come to the rescue. The situation is worsening and people are scared to step out. We would be highly obliged if more constables were deployed and the entry and exit points were checked regularly. It is a humble request from all the residents and we hope to get some relief soon.
          </p>
          <p>
           Thanking you,
           <br/>
           You rs sincerely,
           <br/>

           The Editor,
           <br/>
           The Times of India,

           Delhi
           <br/>
           Subject: Need for English communication
           <br/>
           Sir,
           <br/>
           Through the columns of this esteemed daily, I would like to stress the importance of English communication in English which is a very significant aspect of today’s daily life. Communicating in English has become necessary for everyone whether a student or a professional. English is a global language that can be a medium of communication anywhere and everywhere so it should be stressed right from the beginning.
          </p>
          <p>
           Though all learners in our country study English in all classes, they do not focus on improving their communication skills which go a long way ahead in their future. To seek a good job, they have to join classes for improving the same. If the importance is made apparent right at the basic stages along with other subjects, students can excel in language learning and thereby go for all-round development in the future. Numerous good candidates fail to get hired by a company due to a lack of communication in English. Therefore, right from the initial stages, parents and teachers should emphasize communication in English. I hope this will serve as an awareness to all.
          </p>
          <p>
           Thanking you,
           <br/>
           Yours Faithfully.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Global weather has been undergoing a drastic change and global warming is responsible for creating arctic meltdowns. The pie chart represents the various sectors responsible for climate change. According to the chart, energy and electricity generation accounts for the largest percentage in its contribution in global warming, which is 33%. This can be attributed to the burning of fossil fuels to generate electricity, which releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The transportation sector comes in second with 27%, which includes emissions from vehicles such as cars, trucks, and airplanes.
          </p>
          <p>
           The industry sector follows closely at 19%, which involves manufacturing processes and the use of energy for heating and cooling. Agriculture, commercial, and residential sectors contribute 7%, 7%, and 6% respectively. The remaining 1% can be attributed to other miscellaneous activities. Overall, the chart highlights the need for urgent measures to be taken by governments and individuals to reduce emissions and mitigate climate change.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The chart provides an insight into the online activities of social media users in India, classified by age group. The highest percentage of all age groups use social media to get news. The percentage of teenagers engaging in online games is the highest among all age groups, with 81%. Searching for people and profiles online is not that popular among any of the age groups, but users in their 20s lead this cohort as networking seems to be important to them.
          </p>
          <p>
           Users in their teens and above are more focused on buying products online, with the highest percentage among them being 73%. It is interesting to note that the percentage of users engaged in product research increases with age, with the highest percentage being among those in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. However, the percentage of users engaged in downloading activities decreases with age.
          </p>
          <p>
           In conclusion, the chart indicates that social media is an important platform for getting news and staying connected with people for all age groups in India. Online gaming is most popular among teenagers, while product research and online buying are more prevalent among older age groups.

           A. Changing Tastes of Music Lovers
           <br/>
           Classical music that had stood the test of time is losing its popularity. Based on the sales record of the shop given in the table, Indian classical music is the least popular among music lovers. More records of classical music and western music are sold then the cassettes. Western music holds a slight edge ever classical music. Indian film music is loved the most by music lovers as is evident from the sale of records and cassettes in the three months under review. During January and February it was at least 13 times more popular than Indian classical music and 7 times more popular than Western music.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           B. The modern time is all about the social media junkies wherein people not only post about their lives but also earn from doing so. What is more astounding is that it is not limited to a particular age group but includes people from all sections of life. A recent survey released its data providing information about the proportion of people using social media according to the age group for India for the year 2020.
          </p>
          <p>
           According to the data, the largest category of digital communicators was the group aged 13 to 25, which accounted for 40% of the total users as expected by all. 35% of people falling in the age group of 26-35 found the second position in the usage of social media in India. While we might expect these categories to be active on social media, what came as a surprise is people between 46 and 55 years of age contributed 10% and people aged 36 to 45 made up 18 percent of active social media users. People older than 55 also spent their time on social media sites scrolling through images and videos.
          </p>
          <p>
           From the given data, it can be easily said that the general trend of India’s social media users during 2020 was that people from all walks of life use social media but it is used the most in the age group of 13-25.

          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) What did the Buddha do after he had attained enlightenment? Why? (The Sermon at Benaras) (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Buddha attained enlightenment after meditating for seven days under a big tree. As he got wisdom under that tree, he called it the Bodhi Tree. He decided to share his understandings and preachings with people so that he can make them free from their sorrows.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Write the message given by the poet of the poem ‘Fire and Ice’. (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The message that the poet is trying to give is that nothing in this world is eternal. The poet first concludes that the world must end in fire after considering his personal experience with desire and passion, the emotions of fire. But at the same time, ice or hatred can also bring total destruction to this world. We should thus, not forget this supreme reality and keep ourselves away from all selfish matters.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iv) Certain qualities like bravery and courage are situational and spontaneous.
           <br/>
           Express your views regarding this statement with reference to the poem The Tale of Custard The Dragon’ (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           It is true that qualitites like bravery and courage are spontaneous and can only be apparent when someone is actually put in a dangerous situation. Out of all of Belinda’s pets, only Custard did not boast of his bravery. Yet, when they faced real danger, it was only Custard, who had the courage to face it. He proved his bravery by facing the pirate and killing him. Custard looked for comfort all the time but this did not mean that he was a coward.
          </p>
          <p>
           (v) What does courage mean to Nelson Mandela? (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Mandela says that courage is not the absence of fear but it is the triumph over fear. The brave man is not the one who does not feel afraid. But, he is the one who conquers that fear.

           Answer ANY TWO of the following three question, in about 40 – 50 words. (2 × 3 = 6)
           <br/>
           (i) What was Liosel’s reaction to his wife’s desire for a new dress? (3)
           <br/>

           <br/>
           The Loisels had been invited to a party at the Minister’s residence. When Matilda told her husband that she wanted a new dress to wear, first of all he asked her to wear whatever she possessed.

          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) “But there was one thing I could do-collect things”. What collection did Ebright make? When did he start making the collection? (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When young, Ebright felt he could neither play football nor baseball but there was one thing which he could do and that was collecting things. So, he started collecting things. He had a wonderful assortment of monarch butterflies, fossils, rocks and coins.

          <p>
           (iii) What was Tricki’s ailment? How did it worry Mrs. Pumphrey? (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Mrs. Pumphrey gave Tricki little extra between meals i.e., malt, cod-liver oil, etc. He was not given any physical exercise. This was the reason for Tricki’s ailment. Tricki became very fat and inactive. It made Mrs. Pumphrey so much worried that she had to call the veterinary surgeon, Dr. Herriot for his treatment.

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Answer ANY ONE of the following two question, in about 100 – 120 words. (1 × 6 = 6)
           <br/>
           A. Do you agree that the story The Black Aeroplane is a mystery story? Justify.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           B. ‘The Tale of Custard the dragon’ highlights the fact that Appearances can be deceptive’. Based on the poem, write a speech on this topic in about 100-120 words.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A. Yes, I agree that this is a mystery story. The narrator was flying his old Dakota plane on a clear night sky. The flying was easy in the quite sky. However, very suddenly and mysteriously he saw black storm clouds in the sky. He had limited fuel, so he could neither fly over the clouds nor go back to Paris. So, he entered the storm clouds. Inside the storm clouds, everything was dark. The narrator could not see anything outside the plane. Again mysteriously, all the equipment of the plane had stopped working and the narrator was lost.
          </p>
          <p>
           Suddenly, a mysterious black plane with no lights came. Its pilot guided him through the black clouds. He took him out of a dangerous situation and led him to safely. After the narrator had landed, he wanted to thank the pilot for helping him. But he was surprised to know that only his aeroplane was seen on the radar. Hence, The Black Aeroplane’ is a mystery story.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           B. Good Morning everyone
           <br/>
           Respected Principal and honourable teachers; today, I’d like to speak on the topic ‘Appearances can be deceptive’. I recently read a poem titled The Tale of custard the Dragon’ which highlighted this fact. In the poem, Custard was mocked by everyone in the house for his cowardice. His mistress Belinda and her other pets always made fun of Custard.
          </p>
          <p>
           Moreover, they claimed themselves to be brave. However, when a pirate breaks into Belinda’s house, Belinda and her other pets got ve.ry frightened. It is Custard who charges at the pirate and eats him alive all at once.
          </p>
          <p>
           Therefore, we should never judge someone from their appearances without fully getting to know then. Judging someone in this manner may turn out to be wrong and unfair. I hope my talk made sense with you!
           <br/>
           Thank You!
          </p>

           Question 11.
           <br/>
           Answer ANY ONE of the following two questions, in about 100-120 words, (1 x 6 = 6)
           <br/>
           A. “Bholi is a child different from others. This difference makes her an object of neglect and laughter.” Elaborate. (Bholi)
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           B. What would have happened to Matilda if she had confessed to her friend that she had lost her necklace? (The Necklace)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The present day society is conditioned in such a manner that it does not tolerate differences very easily. This is exactly the reason why Bholi had spent a childhood of suffering in seclusion. Bholi is not like others. She is slow for her age, stammers when she speaks and is covered with pock-marks. As a result, she has to suffer a lot. Her parents ignore her and mistreat her. She is ignored and neglected by her very family who think of her only as a burden. People laugh at her and children imitate her when she speaks. As a result, she has no confidence or self esteem. However, with education, Bholi rises above her distinctiveness and mockery from other people and shows that she deserves the same love and respect that others do.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           B. If Matilda had confessed to her friend that she had lost her necklace, she might have been in lesser trouble than what she faced after having replaced the necklace. Her friend would have been angry with her and most probably would have asked Matilda to replace it. She would have given her the details from where she bought the necklace and how much it had cost her.
          </p>
          <p>
           Matilda would thus have known that the jewels in the necklace were not real diamonds. It would have cost her a far lesser amount to replace it. Matilda would thus have saved herself and her husband from all the trouble they went through.
