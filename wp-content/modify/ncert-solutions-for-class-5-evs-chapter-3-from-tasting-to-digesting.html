           </span>
           Sense of smell helps in getting the complete taste of a food. In case of medicine, closing the nose, will somewhat mask the taste of medicine. This may be the reason why we are told to close our nose while taking a medicine.

           Lot of sweating happens when you play outdoor games. This results in loss of water, sugar and salt from the body. This can sap your energy. Glucose solution quickly replenishes lost water and sugar. That is why Nitu’s teacher used to tell the girls to have glucose while they were playing hockey.
