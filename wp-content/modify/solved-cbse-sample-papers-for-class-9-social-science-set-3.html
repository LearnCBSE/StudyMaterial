           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Russia had to face shocking and demoralising defeats at several fronts.
           <br/>
           Russia’s army lost 7 million soldiers by 1917. Huge destruction of crops and buildings led to over 3 million refugees in Russia. The situation discredited the Tsar. Many industries producing essential goods were closed down. Able¬bodied men were serving in war leading to shortage of labour. Large supplies of grain were supplied to the army leading to scarcity of food. Bread and flour became scarce. Riots at bread shops and ration shops became frequent.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 9:
           <br/>
           Explain three main features of the Nazi cult of motherhood.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Though Hitler said that ‘in my state the mother is the most important citizen,’ it was not true. In Nazi Germany, all mothers were not treated equally. Women who bore racially desirable children were awarded, while those who bore racially undesirable children were punished. Women who bore ‘desirable’ children were entitled to privileges and rewards. They were given special treatment in hospitals and concessions in shops and on theatre tickets and railway fares.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 10:
           <br/>
           Why are most of the peninsular rivers draining into the Bay of Bengal? Give reasons. Name the two rivers draining into the Arabian Sea.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The main water divide in Peninsular India is formed by the Western Ghats, which runs from north to south close to the western coast. Most of the major rivers of the Peninsula such as the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Kaveri flow eastwards and drain into the Bay of Bengal. These rivers make deltas at their mouths. There are numerous small stream flowing west of the Western Ghats. The Narmada and the Tapi are the only long rivers, which flow west into the Arabian Sea.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 11:
           <br/>

                The Himalayan rivers are perennial in nature. They are fed by the melting snow and glaciers of the lofty ranges supplemented by monsoon rains. Hence, the rivers flow throughout the year.
               </li>
               <li>
                The Himalayan rivers have long course from their sources in the mountains to the sea.

               <li>
                The Himalayan rivers rise in the Himadri, Himachal or Shivalik section of the Himalayas and form the Northern Plains with their deposition of alluvium.

                The Peninsular rivers are non-perennial in nature. They are fed by monsoon rains and have heavy flow during rainy season followed by reduced flow during dry season. So, they are seasonal rivers.
               </li>
               <li>
                The Peninsular rivers have shorter and shallower courses as compared to their Himalayan counterparts.

               <li>
                Most of the rivers of Peninsular India originate in the Western Ghats and flow tow ards the Bay of Bengal. However, some of them originate in the Central Highlands and flow towards west.

           Question 12:
           <br/>
           Name three longitudinal divisions of the Himalayas. State one characteristic feature of each.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Himalayas consists of three sections comprising parallel ranges running from west to east. The nothern-most section is known as the Greater or Inner Himalayas. On account of its permanent snow cover and glaciers the section is also termed as Himadri. It is the most continuous section. The average height of these ranges is 6000 metres.
           <br/>
           To the south of Himadri lie the rugged ranges of the Lesser Himalayas or the Himachal. Their average width is 50 km. The average height ranges between 3700 and 4500 metres.
           <br/>
           The outermost range of the Himalayas is called the Outer Himalayas or the Shivaliks. They extend over a width of 10-50 km. They are discontinuous ranges. Their average height is between 900 and 1100 metres. They are composed of unconsolidated sediments, gravel and alluvium.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 13:
           <br/>
           What do you understand by the principle of ‘universal adult franchise’? How does it ensure political equality in a country?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           It means giving the right to vote, to get elected or elect representatives of legislative bodies without discrimination on the basis of caste, class, gender or race.
           <br/>
           It ensures political equality because any adult citizen can elect or get elected to the legislature. Every adult citizen has one vote and each vote has one value. All citizens have equal right to elect and get elected as representatives.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 14:
           <br/>
           “The preamble of Indian Constitution provides a philosophy and values of
           <br/>
           Constitution.” Explain any three values that you derive from it.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Justice : Citizens cannot be discriminated on the grounds of caste, religion and gender. Social inequalities have to be reduced. Government should work for the welfare of all, especially of the disadvantaged group.
           <br/>
           (ii) Equality : All are equal before the law. The traditional social inequalities have to be ended. The government should ensure equal opportunity for all.
           <br/>
           (iii) Liberty : There are no unreasonable restrictions on the citizens in what they think, how they wish to express their thoughts and the way they wish to follow up their thoughts in action.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 15:
           <br/>
           Discuss the powers and functions of the Parliament.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Parliament is the final authority for making laws in the country. It can also change laws and make new ones in their place. It exercises control over those who run the government. In India, this control is direct and full. It also controls the finances and the budget. It is the highest forum of discussion and debate on public issues and national policies.
           <br/>
           The Parliament plays a pivotal role in the elections of the Prime Minister, President and the Vice-President. The cabinet headed by the Prime Minister is responsible to the Lok Sabha and has to resign in case it loses die confidence of the Lok Sabha. The Parliament is also responsible for impeachment of judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts of India.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 16:
           <br/>
           Give a brief account of inter-state disparities of poverty in India. Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) In 20 states and union territories, the poverty ratio is less than the national average.
           <br/>
           (ii) In the states of Odisha, Bihar, Assam, Tripura and Uttar Pradesh, poverty percentage is more than 35. So, poverty is a serious problem in these states. Along with rural poverty, urban poverty is also high in these states.
           <br/>
           (iii) While in the states like Kerala, Jammu and Kashmir, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh there is significant decline in poverty.
           <br/>
           (iv) States like Punjab and Haryana have succeeded in reducing poverty with the help of high agricultural growth rate.
           <br/>
           (v) In West Bengal, land reform measures have helped in reducing poverty.

           Question 17:
           <br/>
           Write a note on the role of cooperatives in providing food and related items.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The cooperatives are playing an important role in food security in India, especially in the southern and western parts of the country. The cooperative societies set up shops to sell goods to the poor people at lower prices. For example, out of all fair price shops operating in Tamil Nadu, nearly 94 per cent are being run by the cooperatives. In Delhi, Mother Dairy is providing milk and
           <br/>
           vegetables to the consumers at controlled prices which is decided by the Delhi government. Amul is another example in this regard. It has brought about the White Revolution in the country. There are many more cooperatives and NGOs working intensively towards this direction.

           Question 18:
           <br/>
           Give three reasons why small farmers have to arrange capital by borrowing.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Small farmers have no extra or surplus money to invest in farming. They consume whatever they produce.
           <br/>
           (ii) They need to buy seeds, fertilisers and pesticides for agriculture.
           <br/>
           (iii) They need to arrange for irrigation and repair farm implements and tools. Banks don’t
           <br/>
           (iv) provide them credit. So they have to borrow from moneylenders and relatives.

           Question 19A:
           <br/>
           Mention the various uses of forests.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Forests give us varieties of things to satisfy our different needs — fuel, fodder, leaves, trees suitable for building ships or railways, trees that can provide hard wood. Forest products like roots, fruits, tubers, herbs are used for medicinal purposes, wood for agricultural implements like yokes, ploughs, etc. Forests provide shelter to animals and birds. They also add moisture to atmosphere. Rainfall is trapped in forest lands.
           <br/>
           Forests are the chief habitat of all forms of flora and fauna. Apart from causing rainfall, being an important link in the food chain system, maintaining much- needed ecological balance, forests have great aesthetic value. The flora and fauna like flowers of various hues and colours and birds have inspired poets and artists since time immemorial.
           <br/>
           Forests lend beauty to our environment.

           Question 19B:
           <br/>
           How did the pastoralists cope with the changes introduced during the colonial period?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Under colonial rule the life of the pastoralists changed completely. Their grazing grounds became less, their movements were regulated, the revenues they had to pay increased, their trade and crafts and agricultural produce declined. The pastoralists adjusted with these changes. They reduced the number of cattle in their herds. They discovered new pastures. Some bought land and began to lead a settled life. Some poor peasants borrowed money to survive. In due course of time, they lost their cattle and sheep and became labourers.

           Question 19C:
           <br/>
           Which innovations helped farmers to increase agricultural production in England?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           First, new lands were brought under cultivation, landlords sliced up pasture lands, carved up open fields, cut up forests, took over marshes. The farmers started growing turnips and clover as they discovered that these crops improved the soil and made it more fertile. Turnip was also good fodder for the cattle. So, they became part of cropping system.
           <br/>
           They also realised that nitrogen was important for crop growth. Turnip and clover restored the nitrogen and made the soil fertile again.

           Question 20A:
           <br/>
           How was the Maasai Society divided in precolonial period? How did the arrangement change because of the colonial policies?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           During colonial period Maasai society was divided into two categories — warriors and elders. The Elders formed the ruling group. They met in councils held from time to time to discuss affairs of the communities and resolve the disputes. The warriors consisted of young people whose main work was protection of the tribe. They defended their communities and organised cattle raids. Young men were recognised as a members of the warrior class after proving their ability.
           <br/>
           After the colonial period the British made certain changes. The British appointed chiefs of various subgroups of Maasai. They were responsible for various affairs of the tribe. The British also imposed restrictions on raidings and wars. As a result of the British policies the chiefs accumulated wealth as they had regular income to buy land and cattle. In course of time they started trading and lived in towns. The chiefs managed to survive but other poor pastoralists were subjected to a lot of hardship.

           What was the effect of plantations on forests of India?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Large areas of natural forests were also cleared to make way for tea, coffee and rubber plantation. There were growing demands for these commodities in Europe. British traders expected a lot of profits in exporting these to Europe. The colonial government took over the forests, and gave vast areas to European planters at cheap rates. These areas were cleared of forests, enclosed and planted with tea or coffee or rubber.

           <br/>
           Describe the ‘Open Field System’ prevailing in England in the 18th and early 19th centuries.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In large parts of English countryside vast stretches of land were open.
           <br/>
           Peasants cultivated on strips of land around their villages. In the beginning of cropping season, each village was allotted a strip of land. There strips were located in different places and were of different quality. Every villager was allotted a mix of good and bad plots. Beyond the cultivated strips of land, lay the common land or open pastures. All villagers had access to the common land where they grazed their cattle, collected firewood and fruits from common land. The common lands were essential for survival of poor peasants. The resources from common forests supplemented their income, sustained their cattle and helped the poor tide over lean periods.

           Question 21:
           <br/>
           What is the difference between (a) ‘flora’ and ‘fauna’ and (b) ‘natural vegetation’ and ‘planted vegetation’?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In any given region whatever types of plants grow in a period, due to particular physical characteristics of that region, it is called ‘flora’. It includes everything from bushes to high plants, from grass to floral plants. ‘Fauna’ is used to describe all sorts of big and small animals found in any particular region over a particular period of time.
           <br/>
           ‘Natural vegetation’ is grown naturally in any region due to the climate, soil, relief and land of any particular region. It grows without the help of any external factor. When any type of plant or vegetation is grown in any region by human beings, it is called ‘planted vegetation.’ It is controlled by human beings at every stage.

           Question 22:
           <br/>
           How can you say that the President occupies the position of a nominal head of the State?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The President is not elected directly by the people. She or he can never claim the kind of direct popular mandate that the Prime Minister can. This ensures that she or he remains only a nominal executive. All the powers of the President are actually exercised by the Prime Minister of India. The Constitution gives vast powers to the President. But he/she exercises them only on the advice of the Council of Ministers. The President can ask the Council of Ministers to reconsider its advice. But if the same advice is given again, she or he is bound to act according to it. Similarly, when the bill comes to the President for signatures she / he can return it to the Parliament with her / his advice but when the bill comes for her / his signatures again, she / he’ has to sign it, whether the Parliament agrees to her / his advice or not. The President also has a few discretionary powers, particularly in the appointment of the Prime Minister.

           Question 23:
           <br/>
           Explain the Right against Exploitation.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Constitution mentions three specific evils and declares these illegal. First, the Constitution prohibits ‘traffic in human beings.’ Traffic means selling and buying of human beings for immoral purposes. Second, our Constitution also prohibits forced labour or begar in any form. It also bans ‘bonded’ labour. ‘Begar’ is a practice where the worker is forced to render service to the ‘master’ free of charge or at a nominal remuneration. Finally, the Constitution also prohibits child labour. No one can employ a child below the age of 14 to work in any factory or mine or in any other hazardous work, such as railways and ports. Using this as basis, many laws have been made to prohibit children from working in industries such as beedi making, firecrackers and matches, printing and dyeing.

           Question 24:
           <br/>
           Describe the national level Food for Work programme.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The national Food for Work programme was launched on November 14,2004 in 150 most backward districts of the country with the objective of intensifying the generation of supplementary wage employment. The programme is open to all rural poor who are in need of wage employment and desire to do manual unskilled work. It is implemented as a 100 per cent centrally sponsored scheme and the foodgrains are provided to states free of cost. The collector is the modal officer at the district level and has the overall responsibility of planning, implementation, coordination, monitoring and supervision. For 2004-05, Rs 2020 crore was allocated for the programme in addition to 20 lakh tonnes of foodgrains.

           Question 25:
           <br/>
           How is attainment of food security related to hunger? Differentiate between chronic and seasonal hunger.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Attainment of food security involves eliminating current hunger and reducing the risks of future hunger.
           <br/>
           Chronic hunger is a consequence of diets persistently inadequate in terms of quantity and/or quality. Poor people suffer from chronic hunger because of their very low income and in turn inability to buy food even for survival. Seasonal hunger is related to cycles of food growing and harvesting. This is prevalent in rural areas because of the seasonal nature of agricultural activities and in urban areas because of the casual labour, for example, there is less work for casual construction labour during the rainy season. This type of hunger exists when a person is unable to get work for the entire year. Fortunately, the occurrence of both types of hunger has declined in India recently.
