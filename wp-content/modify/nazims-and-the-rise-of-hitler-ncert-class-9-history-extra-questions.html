Even sports was used to nurture a spirit of violence and aggression among children. Hitler believed boxing made children iron-hearted, strong and masculine.

           Question 7.
           <br/>
           What was the Nazis ideology regarding motherhood ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In Nazi Germany, children were repeatedly told that women were radically different from men. It was preached that the fight for equal rights for men and women was wrong and it would destroy the society. The boys were taught to be aggressive, masculine and steel-hearted. The girls were taught to become good mothers. They were supposed to rear pure-blooded Aryan children and maintain the purity of the race. They had to distance themselves from Jews, look after the home, and over and above teach their children the Nazi values.

           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The victory of Nazism in Germany led to the destruction of democracy and establishment of dictatorship.
           </li>
           <li>
            It also led to the militarism and preparation for the war.
           </li>
           <li>
            In Germany, all other political parties were banned except the Nazi Party.
           </li>
           <li>

           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Why did the USA show unwillingness to get involve in the Second World War initially ? Why did it change its attitude afterwards ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The USA had resisted involvement in the war. It was unwilling to once again face all the economic problems that the First World War had caused. But it could not stay out of the war for long. Japan was expanding its power in the east. It had occupied French Indo-China and was planning attacks on US naval bases in the Pacific.
          </p>
          <p>
           When Japan extended its support to Hitler and bombed the US base at Pearl Harbor, the US entered the Second World War. The war ended in May 1945 with Hitler’s defeat and the US dropping of the atom bomb on Hiroshima in Japan.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           At the end of the Second World War the International Military Tribunal was set up in Nuremberg to prosecute Nazi War Criminals.

           Question 11.
           <br/>
           What is hyperinflation ? What were the factors that led to hyperinflation in Germany ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Hyperinflation is a situation when prices rise phenomenally high. This situation occurred in Germany in 1932 due to following reasons :
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Germany had fought the war largely on loans and had to pay war reparations in gold. This depleted gold reserves at a time resources were scarce.
           </li>
           <li>
            In 1923 Germany refused to pay, and the French occupied its leading industrial area, Ruhr, to claim their coal. Germany retaliated with passive resistance and printed paper currency recklessly. With too much printed money in circulation, the value of the German mark fell.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Question 12.
           <br/>
           Explain the factors which led to the rise of Hitler in Germany.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The factors which led to the rise of Hitler in Germany were :
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Germany was compelled to sign the treaty by which she had to pay a huge war indemnity. This treaty created the feeling of dissatisfaction among the people of Germany. The Weimar Republic was regarded as a symbol of national disgrace. Hitler assured the Germans about the restoration of the old prestige, so they became his followers.
           </li>
           <li>
            Germany had to face a Great Economic crisis after the First World War. Many soldiers were no more in service, so they became unemployed. Trade and commerce were ruined. In 1929, there was, however, a great slump in Europe. Germany was in the grip of unemployment and starvation. The prices rose and the value of money fell.
           </li>
           <li>
            The Germans had no faith in democracy. It was against their culture and tradition. They, at once, gave support to a strong man of action like Hitler who could turn their dreams into reality.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Question 13.
           <br/>
           What were the provision of the famous Enabling Act ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           On 3 March 1933, the famous Enabling Act was passed. The provisions of the Enabling Act were given below :
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            This Act established dictatorship in Germany. It gave Hitler all powers to sideline Parliament and rule by decree.
           </li>
           <li>
            All political parties and trade unions were banned except for the Nazi Party and its affiliates. The state established complete control over the economy, media, army and judiciary.
           </li>
           <li>
            Special surveillance and security forces were created to control and order society in ways that the Nazis wanted.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Question 14.
           <br/>
           What promises did Hitler make to the German people ? How did he mobilise them ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Hitler was a powerful speaker. His passion and his words moved people. He promised to build a strong nation, undo the injustice of the Versailles Treaty and restore the dignity of the German people.
          </p>
          <p>
           He promised employment for those looking for work, and a secure future for the youth. He promised to weed out all foreign influences and resist all foreign ‘conspiracies’ against Germany.
          </p>
          <p>
           Hitler devised a new style of politics. He understood the significance of rituals and spectacle in mass mobilisation. Nazis held massive rallies and public meetings to demonstrate the support for Hitler and instil a sense of unity among the people. The Red banners with the Swastika, the Nazi salute, and the ritualised rounds of applause after the speeches were all part of this spectacle of power.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 15.
           <br/>
           From whom did Hitler borrow his racist ideology ? Explain.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Hitler borrowed his racist ideology from thinkers like Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer.
           <br/>
           (b) Darwin was a natural scientist who tried to explain the creation of plants and • animals through the concept of evolution and natural selection. Darwin never
           <br/>
           advocated human intervention in what he thought was a purely natural process of selection.
           <br/>
           (c) Herbert Spencer later added the idea of survival of the fittest. According to this idea, only those species survived on earth that could adapt themselves to changing climatic conditions.
           <br/>
           However, his ideas were used by racist thinkers and politicians to justify imperial rule over conquered peoples.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 16.
           <br/>
           Describe the effect of Great Economic depression on Germany ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The effect of Great Economic depression on Germany were :
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The German economy was the worst hit by the Great Economic depression. By 1932, industrial production was reduced to 40% of the 1929 level. Workers lost their jobs or were paid reduced wages.
           </li>
           <li>
            The number of unemployed touched an unprecedented 6 million. Men could be seen on streets with placards saying,’ Willing to do any work’. As jobs disappeared, youth took to criminal activities, and total despair became common place.
           </li>
           <li>
            There were deep anxieties and fears in people. The middle classes, especially salaried employees and pensioners, saw their savings diminish when the currency lost its value.
           </li>
           <li>
            The large mass of peasantry was badly affected by a sharp fall in agricultural prices.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Question 17.
           <br/>
           ‘In my state the mother is the most important citizen.’ Discuss this statement made by Hitler.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Though Hitler said that in my state the mother is the most important citizen, it was not true.
           <br/>
           (b) All mothers were not treated equally. Women who bore racially desirable children were awarded, while those who bore racially undesirable children were punished.
           <br/>
           (c) Women who bore ‘desirable’ children were entitled to privileges and rewards. They were given special treatment in hospitals and concessions in shops and on theatre tickets and railway fares.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The following steps were taken by Hitler for the destruction of democracy :
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            A mysterious fire that broke out in the German Parliament building in February, 1933 indefinitely suspended civic rights. It is said that the fire was broken out by Hitler’s supporters, while Hitler blamed his political enemies for it. The Fire Decree of 28 February, 1933 indefinitely suspended civic rights such as freedom of expression, speech, press and assembly that had been guaranteed by the Weimar Constitution.
           </li>
           <li>
            After that Adolf Hitler turned on his enemy, i.e., the Communists of Germany, most ‘ of the communists were quickly packed off to the newly established concentration camps.
           </li>
           <li>
            The repression of the Communists was severe. Their membership was in thousands. They were, however, only one among the 52 types of victims persecuted by the Nazis across the country.
           </li>
           <li>
            On 3rd March, 1933, the famous Enabling Act was passed. This Act established dictatorship in Germany. It gave Adolf Hitler all political and administrative powers to sideline German Parliament and rule by decree.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The victory of Nazism produced far reaching effects on Germany :
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Hitler tried to pull his country out of the Economic Crisis that had befallen on Germany as a result of her defeat in the First World War.
            <br/>
            Different types of industries were set up to provide work to the workmen. Trade was encouraged with the same aim in mind.
           </li>
           <li>
            Hitler inspired to make Germany a powerful country and enhanced his military power in all possible ways.
           </li>
           <li>
            All political parties except the Nazi Party were banned. And, then a Reign of Terror was let loose in Germany. Assassinations of anti-Nazi leaders took place on a large scale.
           </li>
           <li>
            The Communist Parties were also banned.
           </li>
           <li>
            Trade unions were suppressed.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           What did Hitler do to overcome the economic crisis that badly hit the German economy ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           After establishing his dictatorship in Germany,he took major steps towards the economic reconstruction.
           <br/>
           Hitler assigned the responsibility of economic recovery to the economist Hjalmar Schacht who aimed at full production and full employment through a state-funded work-creation programme.
          </p>
          <p>
           In foreign policy also, Hitler acquired quick successes. He pulled out of the League of Nations in 1933, reoccupied the Rhineland in 1936, and integrated Austria and Germany in 1938 under the slogan, One people, One empire, and One leader.
          </p>
          <p>
           He then went on to wrest German speaking Sudentenland from Czechoslovakia and gobbled up the entire country. In all of this he had the unspoken support of England, which had considered the Versailles verdict too harsh. These quick successes at home and abroad seemed to reverse the destiny of the country.
          </p>
          <p>
           Hitler chose war as the way out of the approaching economic crisis. Resources were to be accumulated through expansion of territory. In September 1939, Germany invaded Poland. This started a war with France and England. In September 1940, a Tripartite Pact was signed between Germany, Italy and Japan, strengthening Hitler’s claim to , international power.
          </p>
          <p>
           Hitler now moved to achieve his long-term aim of conquering Eastern Europe. He wanted to ensure food supplies and living space for Germans. He attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941. In this historic blunder Hitler exposed the German western front to British aerial bombing and the eastern front to the powerful Soviet armies.

           Germany had to pay war reparation after its defeat in the First World War. But Germany refused to pay the reparation and France occupied Ruhr to claim Germany’s coal. In retaliation Germany printed paper currency recklessly. As a result, the value of German mark collapsed and prices of goods soared.

           Question 5.
           <br/>
           What brought about the Great Economic Depression?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           There was some financial stability between 1924 and 1928. Short term loans from the USA helped industrial recovery in Germany. In 1929, when the Wall Street Exchange crushed, the US withdrew all the loans. People rushed in to sell their shares as they thought that the prices would go down drastically. It was said that on the 24
           <sup>
            th
           </sup>
           October alone about 13 million shares were sold. This brought about the Great Economic Depression.
          </p>
          <p>
           The national income of the US fell by nearly 50% between 1929 and 1932. The factories were shut down, exports fell, farmers were affected badly and the speculators withdrew their money from the market. All these affected not only the US but the entire world.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 6.
           <br/>
           How did the Great Economic Depression affect Germany?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           As in the USA and the rest of the world, the Great Economic Depression had adverse effect on Germany and its people. The industrial production came down to less than 40% compared to 1929.
           <br/>
           Workers either lost their jobs or were paid less.
           <br/>
           About 6 million people were left without any employment.
           <br/>
           As jobs disappeared the youth took to criminal activities.
           <br/>
           Total despair, a deep anxiety and fear became common place in people.
           <br/>
           The saving of salaried people and the pensioners began to diminish when the value of money went down.
           <br/>
           Small businessmen, self employed and the retailers were ruined.
           <br/>
           Big business was not possible.
           <br/>
           The sharp fall in agricultural prices affected the peasants to a great extent.
           <br/>
           Women were in deep despair as they could not feed their children properly.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 7.
           <br/>
           What were the powers that were given to the Police Forces in the Nazi State?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The newly organised Police Forces , in the Nazi State, were given so much powers that people could be detained in Gestapo torture chambers, they could be rounded up and sent to concentration camps, or be deported or arrested without any legal procedure. The police force could function with such unwieldy authority that the Nazi state was known as the most dreaded criminal state.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 8.
           <br/>
           What were Hitler’s Foreign Policies?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Hitler’s Foreign Policies were a great success. He pulled out of the League of Nations in 1933. He reoccupied the Rhineland , which was confiscated by the French ,in 1936. In 1938 Hitler integrated Austria and Germany under the slogan, One people, One empire, and One leader.
          </p>
          <p>
           He then captured the German-speaking Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia, and soon gobbled up the entire country.
           <br/>
           In all of his foreign activities Hitler had the unspoken support of England, which had considered the Versailles verdict too harsh. These quick successes Hitler had at home and abroad reversed the destiny of the country.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 9.
           <br/>
           What was the historic blunder Hitler committed in 1941?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In June 1941, Hitler attacked the Soviet Union. The German western front was exposed to British aerial bombing and the eastern front was crushed by the powerful Soviet Red Army at Stalingrad. Thus the Soviet established its leadership over entire Eastern Europe for the next 50 years. This was the historical blunder committed by Hitler.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 10.
           <br/>
           What was the reaction of the common people to Nazism?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The common people reacted positively to Nazism. They saw the world through Nazi eyes and spoke their mind in the Nazi language. The common man felt anger and hatred when he saw the Jews. They marked the houses of the Jews and reported about suspicious neighbours.
           <br/>
           They believed that Nazism would bring prosperity and general well-being.
           <br/>
           A large majority of Germans were passive onlookers and were scared to differ or protest.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 11.
           <br/>
           What were the terms given by the Nazis when they wanted to convey the words ’kill’ or ‘murder in their official communications ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Nazis used the words ‘special treatment or final Solution’ to convey mass killing of the Jews. The words , ‘selection or disinfection’ was used for the elimination of the disabled and to deport people to the Gas Chambers the Nazis used the word ‘evacuation’.
           <br/>
           Gas Chambers were called ‘disinfection areas’. These chambers looked like a bath rooms with fake showerheads.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 12.
           <br/>
           How were women treated in Nazi Germany?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Women in the Nazi Germany were treated as important citizens. Motherhood was glorified, but not all mothers were not treated equally. The women who bore desirable children were awarded. They were given favoured treatment in hospitals and concessions in theatres and shops. Those who bore undesirable children were condemned and punished severely.
          </p>
          <p>
           Honour Crosses were given to women who produced more children. Women with 4 children were given a Bronze cross, women with 5 were given a Silver cross , while women who bore 8 children and more were given a Gold cross.
           <br/>
           Aryan women who deviated from the given code of conduct were severely punished
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 13.
           <br/>
           What was expected of the youth in Nazi Germany?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           All the young men above the age of 18 years were expected to serve in the armed forces and enter one of the Nazi organisations.
           <br/>
           At the tender age of 10 they had to join ‘Jungvolk’ – Nazi youth groups for children below 14 years of age. At 14 years of age they enrolled in the Nazi Youth Organisation called ‘Hitler Youth’.
          </p>
          <p>
           The German youth were educated in the spirit of National Socialism by these youth organisations. They were taught to worship war, glorify aggression and violence , condemn democracy , hate Jews, communists, gypsies and all those who were called ‘undesirable’.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 14.
           <br/>
           Why did the Nazis hate the Jews?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Traditionally the Jews were considered as the killers of Jesus Christ. It was this traditional hostility and the fact that were basically money lenders charging excessive interest that made the Nazis hate the Jews.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 15.
           <br/>
           Why did the German Mark collapse?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Germany had to pay war reparation after its defeat in the First World War. But Germany refused to pay the reparation and France occupied Ruhr to claim Germany’s coal. In retaliation Germany printed paper currency recklessly. As a result, the value of German mark collapsed and prices of goods soared.
          </p>
          <p>
           In December 1923, 1 US dollar was equal to 98,860,000 marks. People had to carry a cart load of currency to buy a loaf of bread. This crisis is known as hyperinflation.
