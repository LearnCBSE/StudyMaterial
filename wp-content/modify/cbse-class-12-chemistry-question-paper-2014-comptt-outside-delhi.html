           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Why is F
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           a stronger oxidising agent than Cl
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Due to low bond dissociation enthalpy and high electronegativity of Fluorine, it has strong tendency to accept electrons and thus get reduced.
           <br/>
           F + e
           <sup>
            –
           </sup>
           → F
           <sup>
            –
           </sup>
           <br/>
           Therefore F
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           acts as strong oxidising agent, while Cl
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           is weak oxidising agent due to low electronegativity.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Homopolymers : Polymers whose repeating structural units are derived from only one type of monomer units are called homopolymers.
           <br/>
           Example : Polyethene, PVC, teflon.
          </p>
          <p>
           Copolymers : Polymers whose repeating structural units are derived from two or more types of monomer molecules are copolymers.

           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Set up Neverest equation for the standard dry cell. Using this equation show that the voltage of a dry cell has to decrease with use.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Cell reaction of a dry cell can be represented as
           <br/>
           Zn + Hg
           <sup>
            2+
           </sup>
           → Zn
           <sup>
            2+
           </sup>
           + Hg (n = 2)
          </p>
          <p>
           Nernst equation E
           <sub>
            cell
           </sub>
           = \(\mathrm{E}_{\text {cell }}^{\circ}\) – \(\frac{0.0591}{2}\) log \(\frac{\left[\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}\right]}{\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}}\)
           <br/>
           The voltage of dry cell has to decrease because the concentration of electrolyte decreases in the reaction.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 10.
           <br/>
           How does a change in temperature affect the rate of a reaction? How can this effect on the rate constant of a reaction be represented quantitatively?
           <br/>
           Sol.
           <br/>
           The rate constant of a reaction increases with increase of temperature and becomes nearly double for ever, 10°C rise in temperature.
           <br/>
           The effect can be represented quantitatively by Arrhenius equation
           <br/>
           K = Ae
           <sup>
            -Ea/RT
           </sup>
           <br/>
           where Ea = Activation energy of the reaction
           <br/>
           A = Frequency factor
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 11.
           <br/>
           Describe the underlying principle of each of the following processes :
           <br/>
           (i) Recovery of silver from the solution obtained by leaching silver ore with a solution of NaCN.
           <br/>
           (ii) Electrolytic refining of a crude metal.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) NaCN acts as a leaching agent or oxidising agent, thus oxidises Ag to Ag
           <sup>
            +
           </sup>
           which then combines with CN
           <sup>
            –
           </sup>
           ions to form respective soluble complex
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Class 12 Chemistry Question Paper 2014 Comptt (Outside Delhi) with Solutions 3" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-167506" height="46" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 569px) 100vw, 569px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CBSE-Class-12-Chemistry-Question-Paper-2014-Comptt-Outside-Delhi-with-Solutions-3.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CBSE-Class-12-Chemistry-Question-Paper-2014-Comptt-Outside-Delhi-with-Solutions-3.png 569w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CBSE-Class-12-Chemistry-Question-Paper-2014-Comptt-Outside-Delhi-with-Solutions-3-300x24.png 300w" width="569"/>
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Electrolytic refining : Here the impure metal is made to act as anode and a strip of the same metal in pure form is used as cathode. When they both are put in suitable electrolyte containing soluble salt of same metal, the more basic metal remains in the solution and the less basic ones go to the anode mud.
           <br/>
           Example : In refining of Cu
           <br/>
           At anode : (oxidation)
           <br/>
           Cu → Cu

            –
           </sup>
           <br/>
           At cathode : (reduction)
           <br/>
           Cu
           <sup>
            2+
           </sup>
           + 2e
           <sup>
            –
           </sup>
           → Cu
          </p>

           Or
          </p>
          <p>
           Describe the principle involved in each of the following processes
           <br/>
           (i) Zone refining of a metal
           <br/>
           (ii) Vapour phase refining of metals
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>

           (ii) Vapour phase refining :
           <br/>
           Vapour phase refining of inetals Here the metal is converted into its volatile compound and collected elsewhere which then decomposed to give pure metal. The requirements are the metal should form a volatile compound with an available reagent. the volatile compound should be easily decomposable so that recovery is easy.

           Question 13.
           <br/>
           Assign reasons for the following :
           <br/>
           (i) Copper(I) ion is not known to exist in aqueous solutions.
           <br/>
           (ti) Both O

            2
           </sub>
           stabilize high oxidation states of transition metals but the ability of oxygen to do so exceeds that of fluorine.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (z) See Q. 23 (i), 2014 Comptt. (II Outside Delhi). [Page 78
           <br/>
           (i) Cu
           <sup>
            2+
           </sup>
           (aq) is much more stable than Cu
           <sup>
            2+
           </sup>
           (aq). This is because although second ionization
           <br/>
           enthalpy of copper is large but ∆
           <sub>
            hyd
           </sub>
           H for Cu
           <sup>
            2+
           </sup>
           (aq) is much more negative than that for Cu
           <sup>
            +
           </sup>
           (aq) and hence it more than compensates for the second ionization enthalpy of copper. Therefore, many copper (I) compounds are unstable in aqueous solution and undergo disproportionation as follows:
           <br/>
           2Cu
           <sup>
            +
           </sup>
           → Cu
           <sup>
            2+
           </sup>
           + Cu
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Oxygen stabilizes the highest oxidation state even more than fluorine.
           <br/>
           Example : Highest fluoride of Mn is MnF
           <sub>
            4
           </sub>
           whereas highest oxide is Mn

           O
           <sub>
            7
           </sub>
           . It is due to ability of oxygen to form multiple bonds with the metal atoms.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Ambident nucleophile : A nucleophile that can form new bonds at two or more spots in its structure, usually due to resonance contributors.

           can act as a nucleophile with either the S or N attacking.

           (ii) heterogeneous catalysis
           <br/>
           (iii) froth floatation process in metallurgy.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Production of vacuum : In Dewar flasks, activated charcoal is placed between the walls of the flask so that any gas which enters into annular space either due to glass imperfection or diffusion through glass is adsorbed and create a vacuum.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Heterogeneous catalysis : If the catalyst is present in a different phase than that of the reactants, it is called a heterogeneous catalyst and this type of catalysis is called Heterogeneous catalysis.

           (iii) Froth Floatation process : This method is used for removing gangue from suiphide ores.
           <br/>
           In this powdered ore is mixed with collectors (e.g. pine oils, fatty acids etc.) and froth stabilisers (e.g. cresols, aniline) which enhance non-wettability of the mineral particles and froth stabilisation respectively. As a result of which ore comes with froth and gangue remain in the solution.

           Question 23.
           <br/>
           Give reasons for the following :
           <br/>
           (i) Transition metals exhibit a wide range of oxidation states.
           <br/>
           (ii) Cobalt(II) is very stable in aqueous solutions but gets easily oxidised in the presence of strong ligands.
           <br/>
           (iii) Actinoids exhibit a greater range of oxidation states than lanthanoids.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) The variability of oxidation state of transition elements is due to incompletely filled d-orbitals as ns, and (n – 1) d electrons have approximate equal energies.
           <br/>
           (ii) Co
           <sup>
            2+
           </sup>
           ion is easily oxidised to Co
           <sup>
            3+
           </sup>
           ion in presence of a strong ligand because of its higher crystal field energy which causes pairing of electrons to give inner orbital complexes (d
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
           sp
           <sup>
            3
           </sup>
           ).
           <br/>
           (iii) Because of very small energy gap between 5f, 6d and 7s subshells all their electrons can take part in bonding and shows variable oxidation states.

           = 84 g) [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Van’t Hoff factor : It is defined as the ratio of the experimental value of the colligative property to the calculated value of the colligative property
           <br/>
           i = \(\frac{\text { Experimental value }}{\text { Calculated value }}\)
           <br/>
           If there is dissociation of the solute in the solution, the Van’t Hoff factor T will be greater than one i.e. i &gt; 1.
           <br/>
           It means observed colligative property will be greater than calculated value.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Association : If there is association of solute in the solution, the Van’t Hoff factor T’ will be less than one i.e. i &lt; 1. Thus, observed colligative property will be less than the calculated value.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Mole fraction : Mole fraction of a constituent is the fraction obtained by dividing number of moles of that constituent by the total number of moles of all the constituents present in the solution. It is denoted by ‘x’.
           <br/>
           Example: x
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           = \(\frac{\text { No. of moles of } x_1}{\text { Total no. of moles }}\) = \(\frac{n x_1}{n x_1+n x_2}\)
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Molality: Molality of a solution is defined as the number of moles of the solute dissolved in 1000 grams (1 kg) of the solvent. ¡t is denoted by ‘m’.
           <br/>
           zi’ 1000
           <br/>
           m = \(\frac{w×1000}{M×W}\)
           <br/>
           where r = ‘eight of solute in grams
           <br/>
           M = Molecular mass of solute
           <br/>
           W = Weight of solvent in grams
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Raoult’s law: For a solution of volatile liquids the partial vapour pressure of each component of the solution is directly proportional to its mole fraction present in solution.
           <br/>
           P = P°x
           <br/>
           Non-ideal solution shows positive and negative deviations from Raoult’s law.
           <br/>
           → is greater than the corresponding ideal solution of same composition. Such behaviour is called positive deviation.
           <br/>
           Example : Mixtures of ethanol + cyclohexane
           <br/>
           Mixture of acetone + carbon disulphide
          </p>
          <p>
           → Negative deviation from Raoult’s law : When the total vapour pressure will be less than corresponding vapour pressure, then it is termed as negative deviation.
           <br/>
           Example : Chloroform + Acetone
           <br/>
           Chloroform + Diethylether
          </p>

           : It has 2 bond pairs and 3 lone pairs. Therefore according to VSEPR theory it should have Linear structure.

          </p>
          <p>
           (b) (i) Because SF
           <sub>
            6
           </sub>
           is showing steric hindrance due to 6 (six) fluorine atoms which make it unable to react further with any other atom.
           <br/>
           (ii) Due to smaller size of F as compared to Cl, the N – F bond is much stronger than N-Cl bond while bond dissociation energy of F
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           is much lower than that of Cl
           <sub>
            2

           </sub>
           molecule is more than the energy needed to break N

           and F

           molecules into individual atoms. In other words, formation of NF
           <sub>
            3
           </sub>
           is an exothermic reaction.
           <br/>
           The energy released during the formation of NCl
           <sub>
            3
           </sub>
           molecule is less than the energy needed to break N
           <sub>
            2

           (b) (i) H
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           S is more acidic than H

            2
           </sub>
           O.
           <br/>
           (ii) Since both P and N contains lone pairs of electrons but due to small size and high electronegativity of Nitrogen in NH
           <sub>
            3
           </sub>
           , the electron density is much higher than PH
           <sub>
            3
           </sub>
           , therefore it can easily donate electrons and acts as strong Lewis base than PH
           <sub>
            3
           </sub>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) The greater catenation tendency of sulphur is due to two reasons :
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The lone pair of electrons feels more repulsion in O – O bond than S – S bond due to its small size and thus S – S forms strong bond.
           </li>
           <li>
            As the size of atom increases down the group from O to P, the strength of bond increases and therefore catenation tendency also increases.

          </ul>

           <br/>
           What is meant by ‘antiferromagnetism’? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Antiferromagnetism : These substances possess zero Viet magnetic moment because of presence of equal number of electrons with opposite spins.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Define dialysis. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Dialysis : The process of separating the particles of colloids from those of crystalloids by diffusion of the mixture through a parchment or an animal membrane is known as dialysis.
          </p>
          <p>

           in the extractive metallurgy of aluminium from its ore? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The solution of sodium meta-aluminate is neutralized by passing CO
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           when hydrated alumina separates out while sodium silicate remains in the solution.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Why is nitrogen gas very unreactive? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Nitrogen gas is not particularly reactive due to presence of triple bond between two N-atoms. The bond length is very small and hence the bond dissociation energy is very large. As a result of which nitrogen gas is unreactive.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Define conductivity and molar conductivity for the solution of an electrolyte. Discuss their variation with change in temperature. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Conductivity : Conductivity of a solution is defined as the conductance of a solution of 1 cm length and having 1 sq. cm as the area of cross-section. It is represented by K.
           <br/>
           Its unit is S cm

           Question 23.
           <br/>
           Assign reasons for the following : [3]
           <br/>
           (i) Cu(I) ion is not known to exist in aqueous solutions.
           <br/>
           (ii) Transition metals are much harder than the alkali metals.
           <br/>
           (iii) From element to element actinoid contraction is greater than the lanthanoid contraction. .
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Cu
           <sup>
            2+
           </sup>
           (aq) is much more stable than Cu
           <sup>
            +
           </sup>
           (aq). This is because although second ionization enthalpy of copper is large but AhydH for Cu
           <sup>
            2+
           </sup>
           (aq) is much more negative than that for Cu
           <sup>
            +
           </sup>
           (aq) and hence it more than compensates for the second ionization enthalpy of copper. Therefore, many copper (I) compounds are unstable in aqueous solution and undergo disproportionation as follows :
           <br/>
           2Cu
           <sup>
            +
           </sup>
           → Cu
           <sup>
            2+
           </sup>
           + Cu
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) In transitional elements, in addition to metallic bonding there is extra covalent bonding due to presence of unpaired electrons in their ‘d’ orbitals, hence they are much harder.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) The actinoid contraction is greater than lanthanoid contraction due to poorer shielding of 5f electrons as they are extended in space beyond 6s and 6p orbitals whereas 4f orbitals are burried deep inside the atom.
          </p>
          <p>

           (ii) In analytical chemistry, they are used in qualitative analysis in which basic radicals are determined by converting them into suitable complexes with specific colour.
           <br/>

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           A reaction is of second order with respect to its reactant. How will its reaction rate be affected if the concentration of the reactant is (i) doubled (ii) reduced to half? [2]
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Since Rate = K[A]
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
           For second order reaction
           <br/>
           Let [A] = a then Rate = Ka
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) If [A] = 2a then Rate = K (2a)
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
           = 4 Ka
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
           <br/>
           ∴ Rate of reaction becomes 4 times
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) If [A] = \(\frac{a}{2}\) then Rate = K (\(\frac{a}{2}\))
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
           = 4 \(\frac{Ka^2}{4}\)
           <br/>
           ∴ Rate of reaction will be \(\frac{1^th}{4}\)
