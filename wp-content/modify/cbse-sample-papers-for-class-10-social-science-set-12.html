           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Energy can be conserved in different ways. Some of them are as below:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Promotion of energy conservation and increased use of renewable energy sources. The people should be made aware of the fact that energy should be conserved and used sustainably. They should use renewable energy sources.
           </li>
           <li>
            We have to adopt a cautious approach to the judicious use of our limited energy resources. A sustainable use of non-renewable energy resources is very important to conserve them.
           </li>
           <li>
            Use public transport systems instead of individual vehicles. People should use public transport instead of private vehicles to save excess use of fossil fuels.
           </li>
           <li>
            Switch off electricity when not in use. One should switch off electricity when one is not using it. It can save a huge amount of energy in the whole world.
           </li>
           <li>
            Using power-saving devices is another method to conserve energy.
           </li>
           <li>
            One should use non-conventional sources of energy.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           OR
           <br/>
           Some ways to improve the usage of solar energy are as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            it can be improved by reducing the cost of solar panels.
           </li>
           <li>
            The use of efficient solar panel models is another method of improving the usage of solar energy.
           </li>
           <li>
            Rising awareness about the importance of renewable energy is very important. In society, people should be made aware of this fact.
           </li>
           <li>
            Easy installation process. The installation process of solar panels is very easy. People can easily install them in their houses on their own.
           </li>
           <li>
            One should buy solar panels with High Concentrated Photovoltaic (CPV) Cells.
           </li>
           <li>
            One should avoid installing solar panels in shaded areas as it will act as a barrier to the production of solar energy.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           Caste inequalities are still prevailing in India. This can be clear by looking at the following facts
           <br/>
           According to the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). the average economic status of caste groups in India remains the same as was in the past. Most of the rich section belongs to higher castes while people of lower castes are generally poor. Despite the Constitutional prohibition. many people are still considered untouchables in the country. Even now most people marry within their own caste or tribe Political parties often field their candidates in a constituency according to the caste prevailing in that constituency. people also tend to vote on the caste lines.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           There are several reasons why rural people are still dependent on informal sources of credit:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The availability of banks in rural areas is very less due to which people are unable to acquire credit from them.
           </li>
           <li>
            The documentation procedures of the banks are too lengthy and on several occasions, rural people are unable to fulfil the formalities of documents due to which they do not receive loans.
           </li>
           <li>
            One of the most prominent reasons is the absence of collateral and the easiness of securing loans from rich landlords.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Roman Catholic Church kept an Index of Prohibited Books from the mid-sixteenth century. The reasons are as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            It was felt that if there was no control over the printed materials, then rebellion and irrational thoughts might permeate.
           </li>
           <li>
            Many monarchs thought that if there is no control, then printed books could lead to rebels against the state authorities.
           </li>
           <li>
            Many religious prerogatives feared that printed materials could make the people rebel against their religious beliefs and faith.
           </li>
           <li>
            The Roman Catholic Church wielded control over publishers and book retailers. The Church began to maintain an Index of Prohibited Books.
           </li>
           <li>
            In the same way, many writers and artists felt that if nobody exercised control on the printed material, then the prerogatives of the precious publications would be perished.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           OR
           <br/>
           Print culture culminated in the development of nationalism in India. The points are as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Print culture resulted in the publication of most newspapers in vernacular languages. Many journals were published after 1870.
           </li>
           <li>
            These journals and newspapers published cartoons and caricatures refuting the imperial rule and gave comments on social and political issues. The vernacular newspapers such as Kesari and Maratha in Marathi languages were overtly nationalist and reflected on colonial misrule and stimulated nationalist current.
           </li>
           <li>
            The British government advocated repressive policies that led to militant protests. Tilak was incarcerated for reporting on repressive measures in his Kesari in 1908. It resulted in widespread resentment.
           </li>
           <li>
            Print culture encouraged the leaders to pass on the ideas to people across the nation. This initiative brought them closer and assisted in the development of nationalism.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The measures to make formal sector loans beneficial for poor farmers and workers are
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The formal sector like banks and cooperatives should lend more to poor people and workers, particularly in rural areas.
           </li>
           <li>
            The formal sector should provide cheap and affordable credit to the poor people so that repayment ¡s easy.
           </li>
           <li>
            Formal sector should work out other ways of arranging collateral from the poor people.
           </li>
           <li>
            By providing linkage between Self Help Groups and banks, the formal sector of credit can be increased.
           </li>
           <li>
            There should be more cooperatives and banks in rural areas and people should be made aware of their presence.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Or
           <br/>
           The lenders ask for collateral while lending due to the following reasons
           <br/>
           Collateral is an asset that the borrower owns and uses as a guarantee to a lender until the loan is repaid. Lenders ask for collateral as a security against loans. If the borrower fails to repay the loan, the lender has the right to sell the asset or collateral to obtain the amount. For a bank in case of taking collateral, the repayment of the loan becomes easy because banks has no risk of non-performing assets.

           Question 34.
           <br/>
           Read the source given below and answer the questions that follows:
           <br/>
           In Africa, in the 1890s, a fast-spreading disease of cattle plague or rinderpest had a terrifying impact on people’s livelihoods and the local economy. This is a good example of the widespread European imperial impact on colonised societies. It shows how in this era of conquest even a disease affecting cattle, reshaped the lives and fortunes of thousands of people and their relations with the rest of the world. Historically, Africa had abundant land and a relatively small population. For centuries, land and livestock sustained African livelihoods, and people rarely worked for a wage. In late nineteenth-century Africa, there were few consumer goods that wages could buy. If you had been an African possessing land and livestock — and there was plenty of both – you too would have seen little reason to work for a wage.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 34.1
           <br/>
           What was Rinderpest?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Rinderpest was a fast-spreading disease of cattle plague which led to the death of millions of cattle in African continent during the 1890s.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 34.2
           <br/>
           What were the two main sources of African economy for past centuries?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           From several centuries, the African economy was primarily dependent on land and livestock. The African people were rarely seen working for the wages.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 34.3
           <br/>
           How cattle plague affected the situation of people in Africa?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The cattle plague proved to be disastrous for the African people as it led to the death of millions of livestock which were the source of livelihood for them. This resulted in the turning of the African people into labourers by the colonisers who gave meagre wages to the people for large amount of manual work.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 35.
           <br/>
           Read the source given below and answer the questions that follow. Another important feature of the Civil Disobedience Movement was the large-scale participation of women. During Gandhi’s Salt March, thousands of women came out of their homes to listen to him. They participated in protest marches, manufactured salt, and picketed foreign cloth and liquor shops. Many went to jail. In urban areas, these women were from high-caste families. In rural areas, they came from rich peasant households moved by Gandhiji’s call, they began to see service to the nation as a sacred duty of women.
          </p>
          <p>
           Gandhiji was convinced that it was the duty of women to look after home and heart, be good mothers and good wives, and for a long time, the Congress was reluctant to allow women to hold any position of authority within the organisation. It was keen only on their symbolic presence.
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) When did Gandhiji initiate a movement in Champaran in Bihar against the oppressive indigo plantation system? (1)

           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) In 1916, Gandhiji initiated a movement in Champaran in Bihar against the oppressive indigo plantation system.
           <br/>
           (ii) Mahatma Gandhiji launched the Civil Disobedience Movement because Lord Irwin ignored Gandhi’s eleven demands including the abolition of the salt tax. Gandhi ji started a Civil Disobedience Movement with the famous Dandi March.

           <br/>
           Women and students participated in large numbers in this movement, which was a liberating experience for Indian women who were entering public space in such large numbers for the first time. Due to this movement, women started playing an active role in India’s political movements.

           Question 36.
           <br/>
           Read the given source and answer the questions that follow:
           <br/>
           COMMUNITY AND CONSERVATION
           <br/>
           Conservation strategies are not new in our country. We often ignore that in India, forests are also home to some of the traditional communities. In some areas of India, local communities are struggling to conserve these habitats along with government officials, recognizing that only this will secure their long-term livelihood. In Sariska Tiger Reserve, Rajasthan, villagers have fought against mining by citing the Wildlife Protection Act.
          </p>
          <p>
           In many areas, villagers themselves are protecting habitats and explicitly rejecting government involvement. The inhabitants of five villages in the Alwar district of Rajasthan have declared 1,200 hectares of forest as the Bhairodev Dakav ‘Sonchuri’, declaring their own set of rules and regulations which do not allow hunting, and are protecting the wildlife against any outside encroachments.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 36.1
           <br/>
           How are forests related to Communities?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           These local communities directly depend on various components of the forest and wildlife for food, drink, medicine, culture, spirituality, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 36.2
           <br/>
           Explain the aim of ‘The Wildlife Protection Act.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The main objective of the Wildlife Protection Act is to protect the remaining population of endangered species by banning hunting. giving legal protection to their habitats and restricting wildlife trade.
