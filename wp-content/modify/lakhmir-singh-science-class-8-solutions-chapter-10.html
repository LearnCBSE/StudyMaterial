           Question 61.
           <br/>
           Which of the following are endocrine glands?
           <br/>
           Salivary gland, Thyroid gland, Adrenal gland, Sweat gland, Pituitary gland, Sebaceous gland (Oil gland)

           Answer:
           <br/>

           <br/>
           Answer:

           Question 63.
           <br/>
           Who is responsible for the sex of the unborn child: father or mother? Why?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The two chromosomes that determine the sex of the unborn baby are called sex chromosomes named X chromosomes and Y chromosomes. A female has two X chromosomes, while a male has one X and one Y chromosome. The gametes (egg and sperm) have only one set of chromosomes. Thus, in females all the egg cells contain X chromosomes while in males, half sperm have X chromosomes and half sperms have Y chromosomes.
          </p>
          <p>
           When a sperm containing X chromosome fertilizes the egg, the zygote would have XX chromosomes and develop into a female child. If the sperm contributes a Y chromosome to the egg (ovum) at fertilization, the zygote would develop into a male child.
          </p>
          <p>
           Thus, father is responsible for the sex of the baby which is born.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 64.
           <br/>
           What will be the sex of the child born:
           <br/>
           (a) if X chromosome carrying sperm fuses with an egg cell carrying X chromosome?
           <br/>
           (b) if Y chromosome carrying sperm fertilizes an ovum containing X chromosome?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) If X chromosome carrying sperm fuses with an egg cell carrying X chromosome at fertilization, then the zygote will have XX chromosomes and develop into a female child.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) If Y chromosome carrying sperm fuses with an egg cell carrying X chromosome at fertilization, then the zygote will have XY chromosomes and develop into a male child.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Hormones are chemical substances which coordinated the activities of the living organisms. Hormones are made and secreted by ductless glands called endocrine glands in the body. The hormones are released directly into the bloodstream and carried to the target site through blood circulatory system.

           <br/>
           The two chromosomes that determine the sex of the unborn baby are called sex chromosomes named X chromosomes and Y chromosomes.
          </p>
          <p>

           <br/>
           Explain how sex is determined in the unborn baby.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The two chromosomes that determine the sex of the unborn baby are called sex chromosomes named X chromosomes and Y chromosomes. A female has two X chromosomes, while a male has one X and one Y chromosome. The gametes (egg and sperm) have only one set of chromosomes. Thus, in females all the egg cells contain X chromosomes while in males, half sperm have X chromosomes and half sperms have Y chromosomes.

           <br/>
           What are pimples? How are pimples formed?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Pimples are small red spots on the face of a person. Many adolescent boys and girls may get acne and pimples on the face during puberty due to the increased activity of sebaceous glands and sweat glands in the skin.
          </p>
          <p>
           The excess oil secreted by sebaceous glands and sweat secreted by sweat glands get collected in the tiny pores of the skin. The accumulation of oil, sweat and dead skin cells block the tiny pores in the face skin. Then, bacteria grow in the blocked skin pores causing swelling and redness of skin which leads to the formation of pimples.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           Sexual characteristics which are present in babies at birth are called primary sexual characters. They include internal and external sex organs which are present in babies at the time of their birth. The primary sexual characteristics in males are Testes and penis.
           <br/>
           The primary sexual characteristics in females are ovaries and uterus.

           Question 92 B.
           <br/>
           What is meant by ‘secondary sexual characteristics’ in humans? Explain with the help of two examples.

           Question 93.
           <br/>
           Describe menstrual cycle. What is the duration of menstruation cycle in women?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Menstrual cycle begins when a girl reaches the age of puberty. At this age, ovaries release sex hormones in the blood which cause maturation of ova in ovaries. One mature egg or ovum is released by one of the ovaries once in about 28 to 30 days. This is termed as ovulation. Before ovulation, uterus prepares itself to receive the fertilized egg. The inner lining of the uterus becomes thick and soft with lots of blood capillaries in it.
          </p>
          <p>
           If the ovum does not get fertilized, then the inner lining of uterus is not required and hence it breaks down and comes out through the vagina in the form of a bleeding called menstruation.
          </p>
          <p>
           Menstruation occurs once in about 28 to 30 days and it usually lasts for 3 to 5 days.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           If X chromosome carrying sperm fuses with an egg cell carrying X chromosome at fertilization, then the zygote will have XX chromosomes and develop into a female child.
           <br/>
           In the other case, if Y chromosome carrying sperm fuses with an egg cell carrying X chromosome at fertilization, then the zygote will have XY chromosomes and develop into a male child. Thus, father is responsible for the sex of the unborn child.
           <br/>
           (a) Raj Kumar and his wife Sunita have been blessed with a baby girl. It means, X chromosome has been contributed by raj Kumar.
