           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Noise pollution causes:
           <br/>
           (a) Lack of sleep
           <br/>
           (b) Anxiety
           <br/>
           (c) Hypertension

           Question 11.
           <br/>
           Your parents are going to buy a house. They have been offered one on the roadside and another three lanes away from the roadside. Which house would you suggest your parents should buy? Explain your answer.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           I would suggest my parents buy a house three lanes away from the roadside because house on the roadside would be much noisy in both days and night due to running vehicles. Whereas, a house three lanes away would be comparatively quieter as the intensity of noise decreases with the distance between the source and the listener.

           Question 12.
           <br/>
           Sketch larynx and explain its function in your own words.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Larynx is also known as voice box. It is at the upper end of the windpipe. Two vocal cords are stretched across the voice box or larynx in such a way that it leaves a narrow slit between them for passage of air (Fig. 13.12). When lung force air through the slit, the vocal cords vibrate, producing sound. Muscles attached to the vocal cords can make the cords tight or loose.
           <br/>
           <img alt="NCERT Solutions for Class 8 Science Chapter 13 Sound Q12" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-106842" height="201" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Science-Chapter-13-Sound-Q12.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Science-Chapter-13-Sound-Q12.png 360w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Science-Chapter-13-Sound-Q12-300x168.png 300w" width="360"/>
           <br/>
           When the vocal cords are tight and thin, the type or quality of voice is different from that when they are loose and thick.
          </p>

           Question 13.
           <br/>
           Lightning and thunder take place in the sky at the same time and at the same distance from us. Lightning is seen earlier and thunder is heard later. Can you explain why?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The speed of light is more than that of the speed of sound. Thus, due to more speed of light it reaches us before sound. So, lightning is seen earlier and thunder is heard later.

          <p>
           Activity 1 (NCERT Textbook, Page 158)
           <br/>
           Take a metal plate (or a shallow pan). Hang it at a convenient place in such a way that it does not touch any wall. Now strike it with a stick (Fig. 13.1). Touch the plate or pan gently with your finger. Do you feel the vibrations? Again strike the plate with the stick and hold it tightly with your hands immediately after striking. Do you still hear the sound? Touch the plate after it stops producing sound. Can you feel vibrations now?
           <br/>
           <img alt="NCERT Solutions for Class 8 Science Chapter 13 Sound Activity 1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-106829" height="258" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Science-Chapter-13-Sound-Activity-1.png" width="207"/>
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           When we touch the pan gently with our finger after striking we feel the vibration. When we hold the pan tightly after striking it, we do not hear the sound. When the pan stops producing sound it also stops vibrating. Thus, we can conclude that vibrating body produces sound.
          </p>
          <p>
           Activity 2 (NCERT Textbook, Page 758)
           <br/>
           Jake a rubber band. Put it around the, longer side of a pencil box (Fig. 13.2). Insert two pencils between the box and the stretched rubber. Now, pluck the rubber band somewhere in the middle. Do you hear any sound? Does the band vibrate?
           <br/>
           <img alt="NCERT Solutions for Class 8 Science Chapter 13 Sound Activity 2" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-106830" height="195" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Science-Chapter-13-Sound-Activity-2.png" width="253"/>
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Yes, we hear the sound on plucking the rubber band. Also, we find that the band is vibrating. Thus, all vibrating bodies produce sound.
          </p>
          <p>
           Activity 3 (NCERT Textbook, Page 758-759)
           <br/>
           Take a metal dish. Pour water in it. Strike it at its edge with a spoon (Fig. 13.3). Do you hear a sound? Again strike the dish and then touch it. Can you feel the dish vibrating? Strike the dish again. Look at the surface of water. Do you see any waves there? Now hold the dish. What change do you observe on the surface of water? Can you explain the change? Is there a hint to connect sound with the vibrations of a body?
           <br/>
           <img alt="NCERT Solutions for Class 8 Science Chapter 13 Sound Activity 3" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-106831" height="201" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Science-Chapter-13-Sound-Activity-3.png" width="241"/>
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           On striking the metal dish we hear sound and on touching it we feel the dish vibrating. Striking the dish with water we see circular wave are produced. Thus vibrating object produces sound.

           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           We observed that the vibrating part of the musical instrument ektara is stretched string.

           Activity 5 (NCERT Textbook, Page 160)
           <br/>
           Take 6-8 bowls or tumblers. Fill them with water upto different levels, increasing gradually from one end to the other. Now take a pencil and strike the bowls gently. Strike all of them in succession. You will hear pleasant sounds. This is your Jaltarang (Fig. 13.5).
           <br/>
           <img alt="NCERT Solutions for Class 8 Science Chapter 13 Sound Activity 5" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-106833" height="256" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Science-Chapter-13-Sound-Activity-5.png" width="199"/>
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           We can hear a pleasant sound. This is due to different levels of water in the bowls.
           <br/>
           Thus, we find that shorter the length of the vibrating air column, higher is the pitch of the sound produced.

           Activity 6 (NCERT Textbook, Page 161)
           <br/>
           Take two rubber strips of the same size. Place these two pieces one above the other and stretch them tight. Now blow air through the gap between them [Fig. 13.6(a)]. As the air blows through the stretched rubber strips, a sound is produced. You can also take a piece of paper with a narrow slit and hold it between your fingers as shown in [Fig. 13.6(b)]. Now blow through the slit and listen to the sound.
           <br/>
           <img alt="NCERT Solutions for Class 8 Science Chapter 13 Sound Activity 6" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-106834" height="218" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 488px) 100vw, 488px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Science-Chapter-13-Sound-Activity-6.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Science-Chapter-13-Sound-Activity-6.png 488w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Science-Chapter-13-Sound-Activity-6-300x134.png 300w" width="488"/>
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           This activity shows that vocal cords also produce sound in a similar manner when they vibrate.
          </p>
          <p>
           Activity 7 (NCERT Textbook, Page 161)
           <br/>
           Take a metal or glass tumbler. Make sure that it is dry. Place a cell phone in it. Ask your friend to give a ring on this cell phone from another cell phone. Listen to the ring carefully.
           <br/>
           Now, surround the rim of the tumbler with your hands (Fig. 13.7). Put your mouth on the opening between your hands. Indicate to your friend to give a ring again. Listen to the ring while sucking air from the tumbler. Does the sound become fainter as you suck air?
           <br/>
           Remove the tumbler from your mouth. Does the sound become loud again?
           <br/>
           <img alt="NCERT Solutions for Class 8 Science Chapter 13 Sound Activity 7" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-106835" height="293" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Science-Chapter-13-Sound-Activity-7.png" width="235"/>
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           We observed that sound becomes fainter than earlier when we try to suck air. But when we remove tumbler from our mouth the sound again becomes loud. Thus, sound needs a medium to travel.

           Activity 8 (NCERT Textbook, Page 162)
           <br/>
           Take a bucket or a bathtub. Fill it with clean water.
           <br/>
           Take a small bell in one hand. Shake this bell inside the water to produce sound. Make sure that the bell does not touch the body of the bucket or the tub. Place your ear gently on the water surface (Fig. 13.8). Can you hear the sound of the bell? Does it indicate that sound can travel through liquids?
           <br/>
           <img alt="NCERT Solutions for Class 8 Science Chapter 13 Sound Activity 8" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-106836" height="205" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Science-Chapter-13-Sound-Activity-8.png" width="295"/>
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           We can hear the sound of the bell which indicates that sound can travel through liquids.

           Activity 9 (NCERT Textbook, Page 162)
           <br/>
           Take a metre scale ora long metal rod and hold its one end to your ear. Ask your friend to gently scratch or tap at the other end of the scale (Fig. 13.9).
           <br/>
           Can you hear the sound of the scratching? Ask your friends around you if they were able to hear the same sound?
           <br/>
           <img alt="NCERT Solutions for Class 8 Science Chapter 13 Sound Activity 9" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-106837" height="283" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Science-Chapter-13-Sound-Activity-9.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Science-Chapter-13-Sound-Activity-9.png 341w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Science-Chapter-13-Sound-Activity-9-300x249.png 300w" width="341"/>
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Yes, we find that we can hear the sound of the scratch. But, the people standing around us cannot hear the same sound or we can say that it is limping not audible to them.

           Activity 10 (NCERT Textbook, Page 163)
           <br/>
           Take a plastic or tin can. Cut its ends. Stretch a piece of rubber balloon across one end of the can and fasten it with a rubber band. Put four or five grains of dry cereal on the stretched rubber. Now ask your friend to speak”Hurrey, Hurrey”from the open end (Fig. 13.10). Observe what happens to the grain. Why do the grain jump up and down?
           <br/>
           <img alt="NCERT Solutions for Class 8 Science Chapter 13 Sound Activity 10" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-106838" height="307" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Science-Chapter-13-Sound-Activity-10.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Science-Chapter-13-Sound-Activity-10.png 245w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Science-Chapter-13-Sound-Activity-10-239x300.png 239w" width="245"/>
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           The grain jump up and down because of the vibration caused underneath the stretched rubber. Thus when sound waves fall on the eardrum, it starts vibrating back and forth rapidly.
          </p>
          <p>
           Activity 11 (NCERT Textbook, Page 164-165)
           <br/>
           Take a metallic tumbler and a tablespoon. Strike the tablespoon gently at the brim of the tumbler. Hear the sound produced. Now bang the spoon on the tumbler and hear the sound produced again. Is the sound louder when the tumbler is struck hard?
           <br/>
           Now suspend a small thermocol ball touching the rim of the tumbler (Fig. 13.11). Vibrate the tumbler by striking it. See how far the ball is displaced. The displacement of the ball is a measure of the amplitude of vibration of the tumbler.
           <br/>
           Now, strike the tumbler gently and then with some force. Compare the amplitudes of vibrations of the tumbler in the two cases. In which case is the amplitude larger?
           <br/>
           <img alt="NCERT Solutions for Class 8 Science Chapter 13 Sound Activity 11" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-106839" height="296" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Science-Chapter-13-Sound-Activity-11.png" width="260"/>
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           The sound produced is louder when the tumbler is struck hard. The amplitude of vibration of the tumbler is larger when the glass is struck hard.Thus the loudness of sound depends upon the amplitude of vibration.

            Question 1.
           </span>
           <br/>
           Sketch larynx and explain its function in your own words. [NCERT]
           <br/>
           <span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer:
           </span>
           <br/>
           We produce sound in the larynx of our throats. The larynx has two vocal cords, which are folds of tissue with a slit like opening between them. When we speak, air passes through the opening and the vocal cords vibrate to produce sound.

            Question 2.
           </span>
           <br/>
           Lightning and thunder take place in the sky at the same time and at the same distance from us. Lightning is seen earlier and thunder is heard later. Can you explain why ? [NCERT]
           <br/>
           <span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer:
           </span>
           <br/>
           The speed of light is more than the speed of sound. Therefore, even though thunder and lightning take place simultaneously, we see the lightning earlier.

            Question 5.
           </span>
           <br/>
           What is a sonogram ? Why is it preferred to X-rays ?
           <br/>
           <span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer:
           </span>
           <br/>
           Sonogram is image of the internal organs. Ultrasound can pass through the human body and are reflected back. The reflections are recorded by computer and images are generated on the screen.
           <br/>
           Sonogram is not harmful and is therefore used for studying the foetus or stone or tumor in the organs. On the other hand, X-rays can be harmful if humans are exposed for longer time.
