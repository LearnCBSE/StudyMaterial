           Define Tyndall’s effect.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           The ciliary muscles of a normal eye are in their

           (i) most-relaxed
           <br/>
           (ii) most-contracted state. In which of the two cases is the focal length of the eye lens more?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The scattering of a beam of light is called the Tyndall effect. Tyndall effect can be observed when sunlight passes through the canopy of a dense forest. In a dense forest, the mist contains tiny droplets of water, which act as particles of colloid dispersed in air.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           The food length of the eye-lens is more in most-relaxed state.

           <br/>
           Rainbow is an optical natural spectrum, produced by the nature in the sky, in the form of a multicoloured arc. The rainbow is formed due to the dispersion of sunlight by water droplets suspended in the atmosphere after rainfall.

           <br/>
           They refract and disperse the incident sunlight, then reflect it internally and finally refract. Due to the dispersion of light and internal reflection, different colours reach the observer’s eye.
           <br/>
           (a) Define the phenomenon of dispersion.
           <br/>
           (b) What are the different colours seen in a rainbow?
           <br/>
           (c) What do you mean by internal reflection?
           <br/>
           (d) Draw a labelled ray diagram to show the formation of a rainbow.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Dispersion of light When a ray of white light on passing through a prism split into seven colours then this phenomenon is known as dispersion.
           <br/>
           (b) Seven different colours are seen in the rainbow which are violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red.
           <br/>
           (c) When a ray of light is reflected back within a medium then it is known as internal reflection.

           Women are at greater risk for developing abnormal TSH levels during menstruation, while giving birth and after going through menopause. Around 5% of women in the United States have some kind of thyroid problem compared to 3% of men. Despite claims that high TSH increases your risk for heart disease, a 2013 study found no link between high TSH and heart diseases. But a 2017 study showed that older women are especially at risk for developing thyroid cancer if they have high TSH levels along with thyroid nodules.
           <br/>
           (a) A 35 year old woman has TSH level 6.03 mU/L. What change should she bring in her diet to control this level?
           <br/>
           (b) When do women face a greater risk of abnormal TSH level?
           <br/>
           (c) State the consequences of low TSH level.
           <br/>
           (d) Name the mineral that is responsible for synthesis of hormone secreted by thyroid gland.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The woman should include in her diet food rich in iodine, vitamin A, zinc and protein.
           <br/>
           (b) Women are at greater risk for developing abnormal TSH levels during menstruation, while giving birth and after going through menopause.
           <br/>
           (c) Consequences of low TSH level.
           <br/>
           (i) weight-gain even after taking normal diet;
           <br/>
           (ii) dry qnd scaly skin;
           <br/>
           (iii) depression and
           <br/>
           (iv) hairfall.
           <br/>

           (b) List any two practices that can be followed to dispose off the waste produced in our homes.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Cereal Plant → Goat → Human being
           <br/>
           Since only 10% energy is transferred to the next level thus there is a gradual reduction in the amount of energy. So herbivores acquire the highest energy from the producers.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Some harmful chemicals like pesticides, when absorbed by the plants through soil and water, get transferred from first trophic level to the last trophic level of the food chain. As these chemicals are non-degradable, their concentration in the bodies of living organisms at each trophic level progressively increases. This increase in the concentration of harmful chemicals in the body of living organisms at each trophic level of a food chain is called biological magnification. The level of concentration of chemicals is maximum for human beings as they are at the highest trophic level.

           Question 23.
           <br/>
           Give reasons for the following:
           <br/>
           (i) There is either a convergence or a divergence of magnetic field lines near the ends of a current carrying straight solenoid.
           <br/>
           (ii) The current carrying solenoid when suspended freely rests along a particular direction.
           <br/>
           (iii) The burnt out fuse should be replaced by another fuse of identical rating.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) One end of the current carrying solenoid acts like a north pole and the other end acts like a south pole. The magnetic field is stronger near the poles, therefore there is either a convergence (at south pole) or divergence (at north pole) of magnetic field lines near the ends of a current carrying straight solenoid.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) One end of the current carrying solenoid acts like a north pole and the other end a south pole. So, if a current carrying solenoid is suspended freely, it will come to rest pointing in the north and south direction (just like a freely suspended bar magnet).
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) The use of an electric fuse prevents the electric circuit and the appliance from a possible damage by stopping the flow of unduly high electric current. A fuse wire works because of its lower melting point. If a fuse with larger rating is used in an appliance, the fuse wire shall not melt and hence would fail to serve the required purpose.

           Question 27.
           <br/>
           (a) Write the correct sequence of steps followed during journey of oxygen rich blood from lungs to various organs of human body.
           <br/>
           (b) What happens when the system of blood vessels develops a leak?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) When the muscles of all the four chambers of the heart are relaxed, the pulmonary vein brings the oxygenated blood (oxygen-carrying blood) from the lungs into the left atrium of the heart.
           <br/>
           When the left atrium contracts, the oxygenated blood is pushed into die left ventricle through the valve v
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           .
           <br/>
           When the left ventricle contracts, the oxygenated blood is forced into the main artery called ‘aorta’.
           <br/>
           The main artery carries blood to all organs (or parts) of the body like head, chest, arms, stomach, intestines, liver, kidneys, trunk and legs (except the lungs). When the oxygenated blood passes through the capillaries of the body organs, then it gives oxygen to the body cells.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) When the system of blood vessels develops a leak, it would lead to loss of blood and the loss of blood reduces the pressure which would reduce the efficiency of the pumping system. To avoid this, the blood has platelet cells which circulate around the body and plug these leaks by helping to clot the blood at these points of injury.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 28.
           <br/>

           <br/>
           (i) Pollen grain
           <br/>
           (ii) Pollen tube
           <br/>
           (iii) Stigma
           <br/>
           (iv) Female germ cell
           <br/>
           (b) State the significance of pollen tube.
           <br/>
           (c) Name the parts of flower that develop after fertilization into
           <br/>
           (i) Seed
           <br/>

           (c) What is sex selective abortion? How does it affect a healthy society? (State any one consequence)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>

           <br/>
           (b) When the pollen lands on the stigma of its own species, it has to reach the female germ cells which are in the ovary. For this, the pollen tube grows out of the pollen grains and travels through the style to reach the ovary.
           <br/>
           (c) (i) The ovule develops a tough coat and is gradually converted into a seed.
           <br/>
           (ii) The ovary grows and ripens to form a fruit
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           (a) (i) Condoms are used to prevent the unwanted pregnancies during sexual activity,
           <br/>
           (ii) Condoms are used to prevent the spreading of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) like syphilis, AIDS, etc. Thus use of condoms is beneficial for both the sexes involved in a sexual act.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) The oral pills contain hormones which stop the ovaries from releasing ovum into fallopian tube and therefore fertilization cannot occur and unwanted pregnancies can be avoided during sexual activities.
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) Sex selective abortion is the practice of transmitting a pregnancy based on She sex of the unborn child. The killing of the unborn female child is called female foeticide. Female foeticide is reducing the number of girls drastically in some societies of our country. For a healthy society, the male-female sex ratio must be maintained at almost the same level Due to reckless female foeticide, the male-female child sex ratio is declining at an alarming rate in some sections of our country.

           (d) It is impracticable to connect an electric bulb and an electric heater in series because they need currents of widely different values to operate properly. In a series connection, current remains the same and voltage is divided according to the resistance of the appliance. When we put the electric bulb and the electric heater in series then it will divide the voltage which ultimately divides the power double.

           Rishi went to a palmist to show his palm. The palmist used a special lens for this purpose.
           <br/>
           (i) State the nature of the lens and reason for its use.
           <br/>
           (ii) Where should the palmist place/hold the lens so as to have a real and magnified image of an object?
           <br/>
           (iii) If the focal length of this lens is 10 cm and the lens is held at a distance of 5 cm from the palm, use lens formula to find the position and size of the image.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Here, Security mirror = Convex mirror
           <br/>
           Given: Radius of curvature, R = 5 m
           <br/>
           ∴ Focal length, f = \(\frac { R }{ 2 }\) = \(\frac { 5 }{ 2 }\)m
           <br/>
           u = -20 m;
           <br/>
           v = ?
           <br/>
           Size = h
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           = ?
           <br/>
           Nature = ?
           <br/>
           According to mirror formula,
           <br/>
           \(\frac { 1 }{ v }\) + \(\frac { 1 }{ u }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ f }\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ \(\frac { 1 }{ v }\) + \(\frac { 1 }{ -20 }\) = \(\frac { 2 }{ 5 }\)
           <br/>
           \(\frac { 1 }{ v }\) = \(\frac { 2 }{ 5 }\) + \(\frac { 1 }{ 20 }\) = \(\frac { 8+1 }{ 20 }\) = \(\frac { 9 }{ 20 }\)
           <br/>
           ∴ v = \(\frac { 20 }{ 9 }\) = 2.22 m
           <br/>
           ⇒ \(\frac { -v }{ u }\) = \(\frac { -20 }{ 9 }\) × –\(\frac { 1 }{ 20 }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ 9 }\)
           <br/>
           ∴ Image formed is \(\frac { 1 }{ 9 }\) times the object.
           <br/>
           ∴ Image is virtual (as v is +ve) and diminished.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) A dentist uses a concave mirror to see the large images of the teeth of patients because when a tooth is within the focus of a concave mirror, then an enlarged image of the tooth is seen in the concave mirror. Therefore, it becomes easier to locate the defect in the tooth.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           (i) A convex lens of smaller focal length is used as a magnifying glass. It will produce , large magnification and hence the object will appear much bigger when seen through it.
           <br/>
           (ii) The palmist should hold the lens in such a way that palm is between F and 2F points of the lens, then the palm seen through the convex lens appears much bigger in size than it actually is. The image will be real.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Given: Focal length of the convex lens, f = +10 cm
           <br/>
           u = -5 cm;
           <br/>
           v = ?
           <br/>
           As we know, = \(\frac { 1 }{ v }\) – \(\frac { 1 }{ u }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ f }\) (lens formula)
           <br/>
           \(\frac { 1 }{ v }\) – \(\frac { 1 }{ (-5) }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ 10 }\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ \(\frac { 1 }{ v }\) + \(\frac { 1 }{ 5 }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ 10 }\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ \(\frac { 1 }{ v }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ 10 }\) – \(\frac { 1 }{ 5 }\)
           <br/>
           \(\frac { 1 }{ v }\) – \(\frac { 1-2 }{ 10 }\) = \(\frac { -1 }{ 10 }\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ v = -10 cm
           <br/>
           So, the image is formed at 10 cm from the lens on the same side where the object is.
           <br/>
           Now, m = \(\frac { v }{ u }\) = \(\frac { -10 }{ -5 }\) = 2
           <br/>
           Therefore, image is 2 times (twice) the object.

           (c) Why is excessive use of CFCs a cause of concern?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) An ecosystem is a self-contained unit of living things (plants, animals and decomposers) and their non-livmg environment (soil, air and water). An ecosystem needs only the input of sunlight energy for its functioning.
           <br/>
           (b) All the food chains begin with an autotroph (green plants) because these are the original source of all food. Thus they are also called the producers in a food chain.
           <br/>
           (c) Grass → Insects → Frogs → Snakes
           <br/>
           Frogs belong to third trophic level. They belong to carnivores.

           Oxygen molecules Oxygen atom Ozone molecule
           <br/>
           (c) CFCs are the chemicals which are widely used in refrigeration as a coolant, when ‘released into the air they react with ozone gas present in the ozone layer and destroy  it gradually. Due to this, the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere becomes thinner, allowing more UV rays to pass through it to the earth. These UV rays cause skin cancer and other ailments in humans and animals and also damage the plants. In the absence of the ozone layer, all the life on the earth would be destroyed gradually. Thus, the production of CFCs should be stopped.

           Question 20.

           Describe an activity to illustrate the phenomenon of phototropism and explain why does this occur.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Experiment. We take a potted plant growing in a transparent glass jar. When this potted plant is kept in the open space, the stem of the plant grows straight up towards the Sim while root of the plant grows straight but in the downward direction.
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Class 10 Science Question Paper 2020 Series JBB 3 with Solutions Img 35" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-165973" height="188" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CBSE-Class-10-Science-Question-Paper-2020-Series-JBB-3-with-Solutions-Img-35.png" width="270"/>
           <br/>
           Now keep this plant near the window in a dark room in such a way that sunlight falls on it from the right side only. After some days, we observe that the stem of the plant bends towards the right side towards the light whereas the root bends to the left side away from the light. This experimental setup demonstrates phototropism, i.e., the shoot of the plant bends towards light. This occurs because the plant stem responds to light and bends towards it due to the action of auxin hormone.

           <br/>
           (b) Draw a ray diagram to show the path of a ray of light passing obliquely from water to alcohol.
           <br/>
           (c) State the relationship between angle of incidence and angle of refraction in the above case.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Alcohol having a higher refracting index than water is optically denser than water because higher the refractive index of a substance, more it will change the direction of a beam of light passing through it.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) (i) Ethanol to Ethene. When ethanol is heated with excess of concentrated sulphuric acid at 443 k, it gets dehydrated to form ethene.
           <br/>

           (b) Describe the structure and function of a nephron.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The gaseous wastes of respiration and photosynthesis in plants (carbon dioxide, water vapours and oxygen) are removed through the stomata in leaves and released into the air. The plants also store some of the waste products in their leaves and plants get rid of these wastes by shedding of leaves also.

           Basic functions of Nephrons:
           <br/>
           (i) Filteration. Filteration of the blood takes place in Bowman’s capsule in the capillaries of the glomerulus. Then this filterate passes into the tubular part of the nephron. The filterate contains glucose, amino acids, urea and uric acid and a large amount of water.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Reabsorption. The filterate flows along the tubule and useful substances such as glucose, amino acids, salts and some water are re-absorbed into the blood by the capillaries surrounding the nephron tubule.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Urine. The filterate which remains after the re-absorption is called the urine, which is collected from nephron by the collecting duct to carry it to the urinary bladder and then to the urethra.

           Question 29.
           <br/>
           (a) Define Power and state its SI unit.
           <br/>
           (b) A torch bulb is rated 5 V and 500 mA. Calculate its –
           <br/>
           (i) Power
           <br/>
           (ii) Resistance
           <br/>
           (iii) Energy consumed when it is lighted for 2 1/2 hours.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Electric power is the electrical work done per unit time.
           <br/>
           ∴ Power = \(\frac { Work done }{ Time taken }\) = \(\frac { Electrical energy consumed }{ Time taken }\)
           <br/>
           SI unit of power is Watt (W). The power of 1 watt is a rate of working of 1 joule per second, i.e.,
           <br/>
           1 watt = \(\frac { 1 joule }{ 1 second }\)
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Given. Potential difference, V = 5 volts; I = 500 mA = \(\frac { 500 }{ 1000 }\) A = 0.5A
           <br/>
           t = 2 1/2 hrs. = \(\frac { 5 }{ 2 }\) × 60 × 60 = 9,000 s
           <br/>
           To find; P = ?, R = ?, E = ?
           <br/>
           (i) Power, P = V × I = 5 × 0.5 = 2.5 watt
           <br/>
           (ii) Resistance, R = \(\frac { V }{ I }\) = \(\frac { 5 }{ 0.5 }\) = \(\frac{5 \times 10}{5}\) = 10 Ω
           <br/>
           (iii) Energy consumed, E = P × t = \(\frac { 25 }{ 10 }\) × 9,000 = 22,500 J or 2.25 × 10

           (a) State with reason the consequence of decrease in number of carnivores in an ecosystem.
           <br/>
           (b) In a food chain, state the trophic level at which the concentration of harmful chemicals is maximum. Why is it so?

           How is ozone layer formed? State its importance to all life forms on earth? Why did the amount of ozone in the atmosphere drop sharply in the 1980s?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) If the number of carnivores in an ecosystem is decreased then there will be no predator control over the herbivores. Thus the population of herbivores will increase greatly. This will lead to excessive grazing of grass. As a result the density of producers will be very much reduced and the lush-green forest will turn into a desert area having no vegetation at all.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Some harmful chemicals like pesticides, when absorbed by the plants through soil and water, get transferred from first trophic level to the last trophic level of the food chain. As these chemicals are non-degradable, their concentration in the bodies of living organisms at each trophic level progressively increases. This increase in the concentration of harmful chemicals in the body of living organisms at each trophic level of a food chain is called biological magnification. The level of concentration of chemicals is maximum for human beings as they are at the highest trophic level.

           <br/>
           Importance of ozone: Ozone layer is very important for the existence of life on earth. The function of the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere is to absorb most of the harmful ultraviolet radiations coming from the Sun and prevent them from reaching the earth’s surface.
          </p>
          <p>
           Depletion of ozone: Chlorofluorocarbons or the CFCs are the main cause for the depletion of ozone layer which was first identified during 1980s (1985). The ozone layer depleted due to over use of CFCs that are released by soaps solvents, spray aerosols, refrigerators and air conditioners.

           <br/>
           (i) First law. The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane.
           <br/>
           (ii) Second law. The ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of refraction is constant for a given pair of media. The second law of refraction is called Snell’s law.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Metal ‘M’ is sodium.
           <br/>
           (b) When sodium metal is exposed to air, it reacts with oxygen of air to form basic oxide called sodium oxide (Na

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) There are three different methods of contraception:
           <br/>
           (i) Barrier methods. In these methods, physical devices such as condoms, diaphragms and cervical caps are used. These devices prevent the entry of sperm in the female genital tract, thus acting as a barrier between them.
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Surgical methods. There are surgeries that can be carried out in males and females. In males, a small portion of the sperm duct (vas deferens) is blocked by a surgical operation. This prevents the sperms from coming out.
           <br/>
           In females, a small portion of the fallopian tubes (oviducts) is blocked by a surgical operation. It prevents the egg from reaching the uterus. In both the cases, fertilisation will not take place.
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Chemical methods. This category of contraceptives acts by changing the hormonal balance of the body so that eggs are not released and fertilisation cannot occur. Females use two types of pills for preventing pregnancies, i.e., &gt; oral pills and vaginal pills. The oral pills contain hormones which stop the ovaries from releasing ovum into the fallopian tube. This is also called oral contraceptives (OC).
           <br/>
           Other contraceptive devices such as loop or the copper-T are placed in the uterus to prevent pregnancy.

           (c) Vegetative propagation practiced for growing some type of plants because-
           <br/>
           (i) the fruit trees grown through vegetative propagation bear fruits much earlier.
           <br/>
           (ii) banana and grapes produce either very few seeds or do not produce viable seeds. Therefore their plants are grown by vegetative propagation.

           Question 30.
           <br/>
           (a) An electric bulb is rated at 200 V; 100 W. What is its resistance?
           <br/>
           (b) Calculate the energy consumed by 3 such bulbs if they glow continuously for 10 hours for the complete month of November.
           <br/>
           (c) Calculate the total cost if the rate is ₹6.50 per unit.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (a) What is meant by the statement, “The resistance of a conductor is one ohm”?
           <br/>
           (b) Define electric power. Write an expression relating electric power, potential difference and resistance.
           <br/>
           (c) How many 132 Ω resistors in parallel are required to carry 5 A on a 220 V line?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Electric bulb potential difference = 200 V;
           <br/>
           P = 100 W;
           <br/>
           R = ?
           <br/>
           As we know, P = VI
           <br/>
           ∴ I = \(\frac { P }{ V }\) = \(\frac { 100 }{ 200 }\) = 0.5 A
           <br/>
           Now, V = IR
           <br/>
           ∴ R = \(\frac { V }{ I }\) = \(\frac { 200 }{ 0.5 }\) = \(\frac{200 \times 10}{5}\) = 400 Ω
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Given: No. of bulbs = 3
           <br/>
           Power = 100 W = 100/1000 kW = 1/10 kW
           <br/>
           Time = 10 hrs. × 30 days (in November) = 300 hrs.
           <br/>
           ∴ Energy consumed, E = 3 × \(\frac { 1 }{ 10 }\) × 300 = 90 kWh = 90 electrical units
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) Cost of 1 unit = ₹ 6.50
           <br/>
           ∴ Cost of 90 units = 90 × ₹ 6.50 = ₹ 585
           <br/>
           OR
          </p>
          <p>
           (a) 1 ohm is the resistance of conductor such that when a potential difference of 1 volt is applied to its ends, a current of 1 ampere flows through it.
           <br/>
           (b) Electric power is the electrical work done per unit time.
           <br/>
           Power (P) = \(\frac { Work done }{ Time taken }\) = \(\frac{V^2}{R}\)
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) Let number of resistors be n.
           <br/>
           Given. R = 132 W;
           <br/>
           I = 5 A;
           <br/>
           V = 220 V
           <br/>
           Resultant R’ for n resistances combined in parallel:
           <br/>
           \(\frac{1}{R^{\prime}}\) = \(\frac{1}{R}\) + \(\frac{1}{R}\) + …. n times
           <br/>
           ⇒ \(\frac{1}{R^{\prime}}\) = \(\frac{n}{R}\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ R’ = \(\frac{R}{n}\) = \(\frac{132}{n}\) Ω
           <br/>
           Now, V = IR’
           <br/>
           ⇒ 220 = 5 × \(\frac{132}{n}\) Ω
           <br/>
           ⇒ n = \(\frac{5 \times 132}{220}\) = 3
           <br/>
           ∴ No. of resistors = 3
