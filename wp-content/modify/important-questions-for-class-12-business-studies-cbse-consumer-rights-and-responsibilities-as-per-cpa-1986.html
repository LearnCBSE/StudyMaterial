            Ans
           </strong>
           . Consumer Responsibilities are: (Any four)
           <br/>
           (i)
           <strong>
            Consumer must exercise his rights
           </strong>
           Consumers must be aware of following rights with regard to the products or services they buy from markets

          </div>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Right to Safety
           </li>
           <li>
            Right to Choose
           </li>
           <li>
            Right to be Heard, etc
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           (ii)
           <strong>
            Cautious consumers
           </strong>
           Before purchasing, consumer must insist on getting all information on the quality, quantity, price, utility, etc of the goods/services. This will ensure a better purchase as he will not depend entirely on a seller.
           <br/>
           (iii)
           <strong>
            Filing complaint
           </strong>
           Sometimes, consumers ignore the deception of traders believing that the loss is small but this attitude encourages corrupt business practices to continue. On the other hand, some consumers also make excessive claims for compensation on small defects in goods which are not justified.
           <br/>
           (iv)
           <strong>
            Quality conscious
           </strong>
           This is the only way to eradicate the problems of adulteration and spurious goods. While making purchases, consumers must look for standard quality certification marks like ISI, Agmark, FPO, Wool mark, etc.
           <br/>
           (v)
           <strong>
            Insist on cash memo
           </strong>
           Ask for a cash memo on purchase of goods or services. This would serve as a proof of the purchase.

            14.Explain any four rights available to a consumer under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.  (All India 2008
           </strong>
           )
           <br/>
           <strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           (i)
           <strong>
            Right to Safety
           </strong>
           A consumer has a right to be protected against goods and services which are hazardous to life and health. For instance, electrical appliances which are manufactured with sub-standard products do not confirm to the safety norms, might cause serious injury. Thus, consumers are educated that they should use electrical appliances which are ISI marked, as this would be an assurance of such products meeting quality specifications.
           <br/>
           (ii)
           <strong>
            Right to Consumer Education
           </strong>
           The consumer has a right to acquire knowledge and to be a well informed consumer throughout life. Many consumer organisations and some business are actively educating consumer. He should be aware about his rights and the reliefs available to him in case of a product or service falls short of his expectations.
           <br/>
           (iii)
           <strong>
            Right to be Informed
           </strong>
           The consumer has a right to have complete information about the product, he intends to buy including its ingredients, date of manufacture, price, quality, quantity, directions for use, etc.
           <br/>
           (iv)
           <strong>
            Right to Seek Redressal
           </strong>
           The consumer has a right to get relief in case the product or service falls short of his expectations. The consumer protection provides a number of reliefs to the consumers including replacement of the product, removal of defect in the product, compensation paid for any loss or injury suffered by the consumer, etc.
           <br/>
           (v)
           <strong>
            Right to Choose
           </strong>
           A consumer has a right to choose from a wide variety of products at competitive prices. This implies that the marketers should offer a wide variety of products in terms of quality, brand, prices size, etc and allow the consumer to make a choice amongst them.
           <br/>
           (vi)
           <strong>
            Right to be Heard
           </strong>
           A consumer has a right to file a complaint and to be heard in case of dissatisfaction with regard to a good or a service. It is because of this reason that many enlightened business firms have set up their own consumer service centres and grievance cells. Many consumer organisations are also working towards this direction and helping consumers in redressal of their grievances.
