          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            The formation of minerals takes a long geological period of millions of years.

            Answer.

           (a) Challenge of expansion. It involves applying the basic principle of democratic government across all the regions, different social groups and various institutions. It pertains to ensuring greater power to local governments, extension of federal principle to all the units of the federation, inclusion of women and minority groups, etc. Most established democracies, e.g., India and US, face the challenge of expansion.

            Explain with examples.

           <br/>
           <strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Foreign trade creates opportunities for producers to reach beyond domestic markets.
            <br/>
            Producers can compete in markets located in other countries of the world. Similarly for the buyers, import of goods from another country leads to expanding choice of goods beyond what is domestically produced. Buyers can thus choose from a wide range of products to suit their individual tastes.
           </li>
           <li>
            With the opening of trade, goods travel from one market to another. Choice of goods in the market rises. Prices of similar goods in two markets tend to become equal, and producers in the two countries now closely compete against each other even though they are separated by thousands of miles.
            <br/>
            Foreign trade, thus, results in connecting the markets or integration of markets in different countries.
            <br/>
            For example., There are endless number of footwear brands available in the Indian market. A consumer who is aware of international trends can choose between a local brand like Bata, Lakhani and international brands like Adidas, Nike, Reebok etc.

           <li>
            The situation of poverty remains unchanged despite government’s initiatives because every citizen does not participate directly in competitive politics and the. problems and needs of the public, especially the poor are not duly represented. People may not have the desire, the need or the skill to take part in direct political activity other than voting. Sometimes people act together without forming any organization, which indirectly helps people to reach the government to listen to their demand or point of view.
