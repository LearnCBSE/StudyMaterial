            Answer:
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The process of verification is essentially meant to check whether the particulars given in the scholarship form are correct as per the documents enclosed.  The verification is done in two steps namely college verification and Independent verification.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            College Verification:  In this verification, the college has been mandated to verify the documents furnished by each student with the entry made in the application form.  Once the verification is completed and all entries are found correct, he would finally sign the same and send it to the department for verification by the verification officer appointed by the District Collector
           </li>
           <li>
            Verification by the Verification Officer:  the verification officer appointed by the District Collector will conduct physical and documentary verification and submit his report either accepting or rejecting the scholarship application.
           </li>
           <li>
            Scrutiny by the Welfare Officer: before each and every application is taken up for sanction it is the responsibility of the welfare officer to satisfy himself of the verification by the college principal and the verification officer and finally sanction the scholarship.
