           Solution:
           <br/>
           (b) Colourless
           <br/>
           Explanation: The colour of the solution observed after 30 minutes of placing zinc metal to copper sulphate solution is colourless because zinc being more reactive than copper displaces it from copper sulphate solution and forms a colourless solution of zinc sulphate.

           Question 3.
           <br/>
           A sample of soil is mixed with water and allowed to settle. The clear supernatant solution turns the pH paper yellowish-orange. Which of the following would change the colour of this pH paper to greenish-blue?
           <br/>
           (a) Lemon juice
           <br/>
           (b) Vinegar
           <br/>
           (c) Common salt
           <br/>
           (d) An antacid
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (d) An antacid
           <br/>
           As pH paper turns greenish blue for weakly basic compounds and antacids contain weak bases like Mg(OH)
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           . So, an antacid would change the colour of this pH paper to greenish-blue. Other options (a) and (b) contain acids and option (c) is a neutral salt.

           Question 4.
           <br/>
           On adding dilute sulphuric acid to a test tube containing a metal â€˜Xâ€™, a colourless gas is produced when a burning match stick is brought near it. Which of the following correctly represents metal â€˜Xâ€™? [1]
           <br/>
           (a) Sodium
           <br/>
           (b) Zinc
           <br/>
           (c) Copper
           <br/>
           (d) Silver
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           (a) Sodium
           <br/>
           Explanation: When dilute sulphuric acid is taken in a test tube containing sodium metal, sodium sulphate is formed along with the liberation of hydrogen gas which is colourless gas. Thus, metal â€˜Xâ€™ is sodium metal. The balanced chemical reaction can be represented as:

           <br/>
           __________ will displace hydrogen from dilute acids.
           <br/>
           (a) Copper
           <br/>
           (b) Gold
           <br/>
           (c) Zinc
           <br/>
           (d) Silver
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (c) Zinc
           <br/>
           Zinc will displace hydrogen from dilute acids as it has a higher reactivity than hydrogen.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 6.
           <br/>
           An element with atomic number â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦ will form a basic oxide. [1]
           <br/>
           (a) 7 (2, 5)
           <br/>
           (b) 17 (2, 8, 7)
           <br/>
           (c) 14 (2, 8, 4)
           <br/>
           (d) 11 (2., 8, 1)
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           (d) 11(2, 8, 1)
           <br/>
           Explanation: Generally, metals form basic oxide while non-metals form acidic oxide. Metals have 1 to 3 electrons in the outermost shell whereas non-metals have 4 to 8 electrons in the outermost shell. The electronic configuration of given elements are as follows:
          </p>
          <table border="2">
           <tbody>
            <tr>
             <td style="text-align: center;" width="114">
              Atomic Number

             <td style="text-align: center;" width="174">
              Electronic Configuration
             </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
             <td width="114">
              7 (Nitrogen)
             </td>
             <td width="174">
              2, 5
             </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
             <td width="114">
              17 (Chlorine)
             </td>
             <td width="174">
              2, 8, 7
             </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
             <td width="114">
              14 (Silicon)
             </td>
             <td width="174">
              2, 8, 4
             </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
             <td width="114">
              11 (Sodium)
             </td>
             <td width="174">
              2, 8, 1
             </td>
            </tr>
           </tbody>
          </table>
          <p>
           Thus, element with atomic number 11 (sodium) having electronic configuration 2, 8, 1 is metal and it will form a basic oxide. Whereas, the other three elements having atomic numbers 7 (Nitrogen), 17 ; (Chlorine) and 14 (Silicon) are non-metals and hence they will form acidic oxide.
          </p>

           Generally, food is broken and absorbed within the body of organisms. In which of the following organisms is it done outside the body? [1]
           <br/>
           (a) Amoeba
           <br/>
           (b) Mushroom
           <br/>
           (c) Paramoecium
           <br/>
           (d) Lice
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           (b) Mushroom
           <br/>
           Explanation: The process of animals feeding on dead and decaying substances or organisms for : getting energy, food and nutrition is called as saprophytic nutrition and the organisms that follow saprophytic nutrition are called saprotrophs. They are the recycler of nutrients as they release specific enzymes that act on complex organic matter and break them into smaller and simpler particles that are easily consumable by the organism. Organisms like â€“ Mushrooms, Yeast, and Bread moulds are saprophytic. They break down food outside the body and absorb the simpler digested particles. Hence, from the given options fungi, mushroom break down food outside the body and absorb the simpler digested particles.

           <br/>
           A farmer wants to grow banana plants genetically similar enough to the plants already available in his field. Which one of the following methods would you suggest for this purpose? [1]
           <br/>
           (a) Regeneration
           <br/>
           (c) Vegetative propagation
           <br/>
           (b) Budding
           <br/>
           (d) Sexual reproduction
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           (c) Vegetative propagation
           <br/>
           Explanation: Plants that are genetically similar enough can be grown by means of vegetative propagation. This method of asexual reproduction is a method of rapid propagation where the sex cells are not involved. The new plant formed is also genetically similar to the parent plant. In this type of asexual reproduction, parts of the plant like stem, roots or leaves can be used to grow new plants. Banana propagation is a type of vegetative reproduction.

           Question 12.
           <br/>
           A sportsman, after a long break of his routine exercise, suffered muscular cramps during a heavy exercise session. This happened due to: [1]
           <br/>
           (a) lack of carbon dioxide and formation of pyruvate.
           <br/>
           (b) presence of oxygen and formation of ethanol.
           <br/>
           (c) lack of oxygen and formation of lactic acid.
           <br/>
           (d) lack of oxygen and formation of carbon dioxide.
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           (c) lack of oxygen and formation of lactic acid.
           <br/>
           Explanation: During heavy exercise, the energy demand is high but the supply of oxygen to produce energy is limited. Therefore, anaerobic respiration takes places in the muscles cells to fulfil the energy demand. This anaerobic breakdown of glucose leads to the formation of lactic acid in muscles. The accumulation of lactic acid in muscles leads to muscle cramps. Hence, due to lack of oxygen and formation of lactic acid, a sportsman suffered muscular cramps during a heavy exercise session.

           When light enters the atmosphere it strikes extremely fine particles, which deflect the rays of light in all possible directions, This is due to â€“ [1]
           <br/>
           (a) reflection of light
           <br/>
           (c) scattering of light

           Solution:
           <br/>
           (c) scattering of light
           <br/>
           Explanation: The earthâ€™s atmosphere is a heterogeneous mixture of minute particles like smoke, tiny water droplets, suspended particles of dust, and molecules of air. When a beam of light enters the atmosphere it strike on such extremely fine particles, which deflect the rays of light in all possible direction due to scattering of light. As a result of this phenomenon, the path of the beam becomes visible.

           Which of the following features relates to biodegradable substances? [1]
           <br/>
           (a) Broken down by biological processes
           <br/>
           (b) Remain inert
           <br/>
           (c) Persist in the environment for a long time
           <br/>
           (d) May harm the ecosystem
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           (a) Broken down by biological processes
           <br/>
           Explanation: The substances that can be easily broken down by biological processes are called biodegradable wastes. These substances are decomposed through the actions of fungi, bacteria, and other living organisms. For example Food waste, paper, wood, cloth, cow-dung, human and animal excreta, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
           On the other hand, the substances that cannot be broken down by biological processes are called non-biodegradable wastes. These substances may be in solid, liquid or gaseous form. These substances are inert and simply persist in the environment for a long time or may harm the various members of the ecosystem. For example, DDT, insecticides, pesticides, mercury, plastics, polythene bags, glass, and radioactive wastes. These non-biodegradable wastes are major pollutants of the environment.

           Question 17.
           <br/>
           Assertion (A): Generally the candle flame is yellow.
           <br/>
           Reason (R): The flame of a candle is yellow due to the presence of unburnt carbon particles.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A.
           <br/>
           A candle flame is generally yellow due to the presence of unburnt carbon particles when light falls on these particles, they scatter a yellow colour. This shows, that the combustion of hydrocarbons in wax (candle) is not complete.

           Question 18.
           <br/>
           Assertion: The probability of survival of an organism produced through sexual reproduction is more than that of organism produced through asexual mode.
           <br/>
           Reason: Variations provide advantages to individuals for survival. [1]
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           (a) Both A and R are true, and R is the correct explanation of A.
           <br/>
           Explanation: The Probability of survival of an organism produced through sexual reproduction is more than that of organism produced through asexual mode. This is because an organism produced by sexual reproduction has a greater survival rate as variations provide advantages to individuals for survival and they can adapt to various environments. Thus, both assertion and reason are true and reason is the correct explanation of assertion.

           Assertion: Biodegradable substances result in the formation of compost and natural replenishment. Reason: It is due to the breakdown of complex inorganic substances into simple organic substances. [1]
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           (c) A is true but R is false.
           <br/>
           Explanation: Biodegradable substances such as food waste, humans and animal excreta, plant products, dried leaves, grass, fruits, flowers, food wastes, wood and other remains of the death of living creature result in the formation of compost and natural replenishment. This is because complex organic substances like carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids present in these substances are converted into simple inorganic substances like hydrogen, oxygen, calcium, iron, and sodium. These inorganic substances are released back into the soil and they serve as nutrients for the growth of plants, thereby balancing the ecosystem. Thus, assertion is true but reason is false.

           A ray of light is travelling from A to B and another ray is travelling from B to C.
           <br/>
           (a) In which of the two cases the refracted ray bends towards the normal?
           <br/>
           (b) In which case does the speed of light increase in the second medium?
           <br/>
           Give reasons for your answer. [2]
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           (a) When light travels from an optically rarer medium to an optically denser medium it moves towards the normal. Since n
           <sub>
            B
           </sub>
           &gt; n
           <sub>
            A
           </sub>
           , hence the light ray will bend towards the normal on passing from medium A to B.
           <br/>
           (b) The speed of the light will increase when the light travels from B to C, Since n
           <sub>
            C
           </sub>
           &lt; n
           <sub>
            B
           </sub>
           and Ï… =(c/n), the speed of light ray will increase in the second medium i.e., medium C.

           What could be inside the box?
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Two lamps, one rated at 100W-220V and the other at 60W-220V are connected in parallel to the electric mains supply. What current is drawn from the line, if the supply voltage is 220V?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Here, the emergent rays are parallel to the direction of the incident ray. Therefore, a rectangular glass slab could be inside the box as the extent of bending of the light ray at the opposite parallel faces AB (air-glass interface) and CD (glass-air interface) of the rectangular glass slab are equal and opposite. This is why the ray emerges parallel to the incident ray. (2)

           (b) Is it possible to have 2 more trophic levels in this food chain just before the fourth trophic level?
           <br/>
           Justify your answer. [2]
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           (a) According to the 10 percent law, only 10% of the energy is transferred to each trophic level starting from the first trophic level or producer level. If the amount of energy available at the third trophic level is 100 joules, then only 1000 joules of energy will be available at the second trophic level and 10000 Joules will be available at the producer level or first trophic level.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) No, since the loss of energy at each step is so great that very little usable energy will remain after 4 trophic levels.

           Question 29.
           <br/>
           Why is the flow of signals in a synapse from the axonal end of one neuron to the dendritic end of another neuron, but not the reverse?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The synapse acts, like a one-way valve because the chemical substance is present only on one side of the gap. This chemical diffuses towards the dendrite end of the next neuron where it generates an electrical signal. Since the chemicals are absent at the dendritic end of the neuron, the nerve impulse can go across only from one side (which contains the chemical substance). In this way, it is ensured that nerve impulses travel in only one direction (through a particular set of neurons). (3)

           Question 30.
           <br/>
           What is the probability of a girl or a boy being bom in a family? Justify your answer. [3]
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           There are 50% chances that a girl may be born and 50% chances that a boy may be born. It can be explained as follows: Most human chromosomes have a maternal copy and a paternal copy. We have 22 such chromosomes. One pair of chromosomes called sex chromosomes is odd and is in not always being a perfect pair. Women have a perfect pair of sex chromosomes, both called X, (XX). But men have a mismatched pair of sex chromosomes in which one is normal-sized â€“ X chromosome while the other is a short one called Y chromosome (XY). A child receives one chromosome from mother which is essentially X chromosome. A child who inherits an X chromosome from her father will be a girl, and one who inherits a Y chromosome from him will be a boy.

           Question 33.
           <br/>
           How do Mendelâ€™s experiments show that traits may be dominant or recessive?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Mendel crossed a pure tall pea plant (TT) with a pure dwarf pea plant (tt) and observed that all the progeny were hybrid tall (Tt), i.e. only one of the traits was able to express itself in the F
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           generation, which is the dominant trait. The other trait is called the recessive trait which remains suppressed.
           <br/>

           <br/>
           However, when he self-crossed the plants of F
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           generation, he observed that one-fourth of the plants were dwarf and three-fourths were tall.
           <br/>
           <img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 10 Science Set 7 with Solutions Q33.1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-152107" height="182" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-Science-Set-7-with-Solutions-Q33.1.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-Science-Set-7-with-Solutions-Q33.1.png 437w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-Science-Set-7-with-Solutions-Q33.1-300x125.png 300w" width="437"/>
           <br/>
           The expressed trait T for tallness is dominant, while the trait â€˜tâ€™ of dwarfness is recessive. Thus, Mendelâ€™s experiments show that traits may be dominant or recessive. (2)

           (b) A species occupies a well-defined niche in an ecosystem, using its ability to reproduce. During reproduction, copies of DNA pass from one generation to the next. This copying of DNA takes place with consistency in reproducing organisms and This is important for the maintenance of body design features (physiological as well as structural) which allows the organism to use that particular niche. Reproduction is, therefore, linked to the stability of the population of a species. (2\(\frac{1}{2}\))

           <br/>
           (a) In cells, the biochemical process in which glucose is oxidized in the presence of oxygen is known as aerobic or cellular respiration. During the oxidation of food, energy gets released which is stored in the form of ATP through the electron transport system. On complete oxidation, one molecule of glucose forms 38 ATP molecules. (2)

           (b) Experiment to show that chlorophyll is necessary for photosynthesis: In this experiment plants having variegated leaves are selected. These plants are kept in the dark for 48 hours to make them starch-free. Then, the paint is researched by keeping it in the sun. After a few hours, the green and non-green areas are marked on a leaf. Following this, the leaf is tested for starch in which only green areas i.e. chlorophyll containing part turn blue-black due to the presence of starch. This shows that chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis.

           <br/>
           (i) What is the kind of lens shown in the above figure?
           <br/>
           (ii) If a real inverted image is to be formed by this lens at a distance of 7m from the pole, then show with calculation where should the object be placed?
           <br/>
           (iii) Draw a neatly labelled diagram of the image formation mentioned in (ii)
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           A 10 cm long pencil is placed 5 cm in front of a concave mirror having a radius of curvature of 40 cm. [2 + 1 + 2]
           <br/>
           (i) Determine the position of the image formed by this mirror.
           <br/>
           (ii) What is the size of the image?
           <br/>
           (iii) Draw a ray diagram to show the formation of the image as mentioned in the part (i).
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           (i) Convex Lens
           <br/>
           (ii) Given, Ï… = 7 m, f = 5 m
           <br/>
           We know that, \(\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{Ï…}-\frac{1}{u}\)
           <br/>
           Putting the values in the equation, we get,
           <br/>
           \(\frac{1}{5}=\frac{1}{7}-\frac{1}{u}\)
           <br/>
           \(\frac{1}{u}=\frac{1}{7}-\frac{1}{5}=\frac{5-7}{35}=\frac{-2}{35}\)
           <br/>
           u = â€“ \(\frac{35}{2}\) = -17.5 m
           <br/>
           Hence, the object will be placed 17.5 m on the left of the convex lens.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The change in colour of the initial and final solution and the deposition of a layer on an element indicates the occurrence of displacement reaction. (2)
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) The blue colour of copper sulphate changes into a light green colour solution due to the formation of ferrous sulphate by a displacement reaction.

           <br/>
           The displaced copper gets deposited on the iron nail and forms a brown coating on it. Hence, students of the D group recorded all the correct observations. (2)
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           The brown coating on iron nails is due to copper deposition. According to the reactivity series, iron is more reactive than copper, so, it will displace copper from its sulphate solution, and then solid copper will get deposited on the iron nail. (2)

           Based on the above data answer the following questions.
           <br/>
           (a) Which of the two characteristics â€“ â€˜free ear lobeâ€™ or â€˜attached ear lobeâ€™ appears to be dominant in this case? Why?
           <br/>
           (b) Is the inheritance of the free ear lobe linked with sex of the individual? Give reason for your answer.
           <br/>
           (c) What type of ear lobe is present in father, mother, Rahul and his sister Nisha? Write the genetic constitution of each of these family members which explains the inheritance of this character in this family?
           <br/>
           (Gene for Free ear lobe is represented by F and gene for attached ear lobe is represented by f for writing the genetic constitution).
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Sureshâ€™s parents have attached earl obes. What type of ear lobe can be seen in Suresh and his sister , â€˜ Siya? Explain by giving the genetic composition of all.
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           (a) Free ear lobe is dominant because it is found in a large majority of the population.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) No, it is not sex-linked. As per the data of the family as well as the class, it is indicated that free ear lobe is present in males as well as in females.
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) Father â€“ Ff (free ear lobe), Mother â€“ Ff (free ear lobe), Rahul â€“ ff (attached ear lobe) and Nisha â€“ Ff (free ear lobe).
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Both Sureshâ€™s father and mother have attached ear lobes (ff). If both parents have recessive character, then all the children will have recessive character only. Therefore, Suresh and her sister siya will also have an attached ear lobe (ff).
