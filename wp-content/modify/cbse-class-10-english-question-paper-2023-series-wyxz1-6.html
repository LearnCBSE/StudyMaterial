           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the following passage and answer the questions that follow:
           <br/>
           1. Mankind’s fascination with gold is as old as civilization itself. The ancient Egyptians held gold in high esteem. Gold had religious significance for them and King Tutankhamen was buried in a solid gold coffin 3300 years ago. The wandering Israelites worshipped a golden calf and the legendary King Midas asked that whatever he touched be turned into gold.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           2. Not only is gold beautiful, but it is virtually indestructible. It will not rust or corrode. Gold coins and products fabricated from the metal have survived undamaged for centuries. Gold is extremely easy to work with. One ounce, which is about the size of a cube of sugar, can be beaten into a sheet nearly 100 square feet in size, and becomes so thin that light can pass through it. An ounce of gold can also be stretched into a wire 50 miles long. Gold conducts electricity better than any other substance except copper and silver, and it is particularly important in modern electronic industry.
          </p>
          <p>
           3. People have always longed to possess gold. Unfortunately, this longing has also brought out the worst in human character. The Spanish conquerors robbed palaces, temples and graves and killed thousands of people in their ruthless search for gold. Even today, the economy of South Africa’s gold mines depend largely on the employment of black labourers who are paid about 40 pounds a month, plus boarding and lodging. They work in conditions that can only be described as cruel. About 400 miners die in South Africa each year.
          </p>
          <p>
           4. Much of the gold’s value lies in its scarcity. Only about 80,000 tons have been mined in the history of the world. All of it can be stored in a vault 60 feet square, or a super tanker. Great Britain was the first country to adopt the gold standard, when the Master of the Mint, Sir Issac Newton, established a fixed price for gold in 1717. The discovery of gold in the last half of the nineteenth century in California, (1848) and later in Australia and South Africa changed everything. Before the discovery, there wasn’t enough gold around for all the trading nations to link their currencies to the precious metal.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           5. An out-of-work prospector named George Harrison launched South Africa into the gold age in 1886 when he discovered the metal in a farm near what is now Johannesburg. Harrison was given a 12 pounds reward by the farmer. He then disappeared and was eaten by a lion.
          </p>
          <p>
           6. One of the biggest gold mining areas in the Soviet Union is the Kolyma River region, once infamous for its prison camp. The camp has gone, but in a way nothing has changed. Many ex-prisoners have stayed on to work in the mines and are supervised by ex-guards.
          </p>
          <p>
           7. Despite the current rush to buy gold, 75 percent of the metal goes into making jewellery. Italy is the biggest consumer of gold for this purpose, and many Italian jewellers even tear up their wooden floors and burn them to recover the tiny flecks of gold. Historically, the desire to hoard gold at home has been primarily an occupation of the working and peasant classes, who have had no faith in paper money. George Bernard Shaw defended their instincts eloquently, “You have to choose between trusting the natural stability of the honesty and intelligence of the members of the government,” he said “and with due respect to these gentlemen, I advise to vote for gold.”

           Read the passage given below: 10 × 1 = 10
           <br/>
           1. Starting Monday, the country’s low-cost Mars mission with the red planet for an extended period will enter the “blackout” phase snapping communication with the satellite. From June 8 to 22 the Sun will block Mars from the Earth snapping communication with the satellite.
          </p>
          <p>
           2. A senior Indian Space Research Organisation official said. “This will be for the first time that there will be a communication break for such a long period of about 15 days. During this period, there will be no communication with the satellite”, he added.
          </p>
          <p>
           3. Expressing confidence about regaining control over the satellite once the blackout phase is over, he said, “the scenario has been tested and the line of communication will be established.” The spacecraft’s life has been extended for another six months in March due to surplus fuel.
          </p>
          <p>
           4. Stating that the spacecraft has been “configured” for the blackout, the ISRO official said, “we are not sending any commands to the spacecraft now, till 8th June few hours of signals will be sent by the spacecraft that will be for about two to three hours per day”. In May next year, the mission will have to go through a similar phase once again, if there is another extension of mission life when the Earth will come between the Sun and Mars.
          </p>
          <p>
           5. Scripting space history, India on September 24 last successfully placed its low-cost Mars spacecraft in orbit around the red planet in its very first attempt, breaking into an elite club of three countries.

          <p>
           Sir,
           <br/>
           Through the medium of the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I would like to express my concern over the scarce use of subways in Delhi by the pedestrians.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is indeed unfortunate that this infrastructural development remains quite unutilized and the very purpose of having these subways is defeated. Pedestrians continue to be prone to accidents on the busy city roads as they try to cut across the traffic.
          </p>
          <p>
           I wish to highlight the dire need of creating awareness about using the subways. Many people avoid using them because they are rather filthy due to accumulation of stagnant water and garbage. The authorities need to take up immediate steps for improvement and regular cleanliness of the subways under proper supervision.
          </p>
          <p>
           I hope you will publish my letter in your newspaper to create awareness among the pedestrians to use the subways.
           <br/>

           (a) The given Bar graph depicts the increasing use of skin care products by men and women both over a period of three months. These products include facewash, toner and sunscreen. The use of facewash has been rather high in men as compared to women. Toner has been used quite equally by both the genders, though its use by men declined in the month of July. Sunscreen was used more by women as compared to men in June and July but in August both genders used sunscreen almost the same number of times.

           Junk food can indeed harm our bodies in different ways. It is not surprising that such foods are called ‘Junk’ food as they have no nutritional value. They have a high level of cholesterol, sugar and salt content and calories. Their consumption leads to obesity, causes diabetes and has an adverse impact on the liver. Some of the junk foods spike energy levels. Even though they cause drop in our concentration, they are still popular. Their rising popularity is due to their taste, low price and convenience. Media can play an important role in creating awareness of the harmful impacts of junk food on the body.

In 2015, the number of students playing basketball dropped to 250 and those playing volleyball rose to 300. The year 2016 saw a sharp rise in the number of students playing both the games. Thereafter, in the year 2017 and 2018 the students playing both games were ranging from 250 – 400. But in the year 2019 this number dropped and only 150 children were playing volleyball and there were 250 children who were playing basketball.

           There is no doubt that technology has changed our lives. It cannot also be denied that the child of the digital era cannot be separated from the use of technology. The use of computers and mobile phones is so common that every student now-a-days owns a mobile phone. Screens refer to the screens of mobiles, televisions, laptops, Ipads etc. and excessive usage of screen-time can cause damage to a growing child. During Lockdown, screens came to the rescue of uninterrupted education and thus became a more integral part of a child’s life. Though it could not replace face to face teaching and physical interactive between the teacher and the taught, screen-time for progressive schools encourage the use of laptops.

           <br/>
           (a) Motivation plays an important role in taking risks in life and in succeeding. Do you agree?
           <br/>

           <br/>
           (b) Valli was an extra-ordinary girl who had self-confidence and courage to realise her ambition by planning and drawing on her spirit of adventure. Discuss in reference to the chapter ‘Madam Rides the Bus’.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Motivation enables one not only to take risks in life but also to succeed. The pilot of the old Dakota plane was eager to get home to England and was looking forward to be with his family. So despite seeing the storm clouds across the sky, he took the risk and did not fly back to Paris. Similarly, the young Seagull was able to make his first flight only because of his family’s constant encouragement and motivation. The seagull’s family continued to beckon him, leaving with no choice except to dive in the air and soar. The pilot and the young Seagull were motivated to take risks and eventually succeeded.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Valli’s self-confidence and courage enabled her to realise her ambition of riding on the bus that travelled between her village and the nearest town. Drawing on her spirit of adventure she meticulously planned her trip. Though she was travelling alone in the bus for the first time, she pretended to be confident when the conductor offered to help her board the bus. When an elderly man called her a child and told her to sit down, she haughtily hold him that she was not a child. The bus journey taught Valli to be independent and gave her the confidence to deal with different kinds of people. Valli is an extraordinary girl who does not hesitate to take risks to realise her dream.

           <br/>
           (b) Matilda was very proud of her beauty and charm and this led to her downfall. Elaborate.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Bholi was a neglected child as her parents felt she had neither the looks nor the intelligence to keep pace with her sisters. Her mother agreed to send her to school as there was little chance of her getting married, so she let the teachers at school worry about her. It was because of her teacher’s affection and encouragement that Bholi gradually transformed into a confident girl. Her teacher gave a new hope that changed the course of Bholi’s life. She became a sharp, intelligent and fearless girl who knew her mind her advantage could not be taken of. A change of social mindset and encouragement helped Bholi to face the world boldly and make a place for herself in a conservative society.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Matilda was very proud of her beauty and charm. She suffered incessantly as she felt she was born for all the luxuries. She always had a grudge that she was born into a family of clerks through an error of destiny. Because of her humble background she had to marry a petty clerk. Her aspirations were the cause of her ruin. Her inability to accept her circumstances led to her downfall. Matilda could have easily avoided the misfortune that befell on her and her husband. The cause of Matilda’s ruin was her vanity, which brings short-lived joy but ultimately leads to one’s downfall.

           <br/>
           Through the medium of the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I would like to express my views on my city, which I have always been very proud of.
          </p>
          <p>
           I feel very fortunate to be the resident of Delhi. I am proud of its historical monuments, places of cultural interest, shopping centres and beautiful parks. Despite the infrastructural development that has been an integral part of our city’s modernisation, we have managed to retain its historical and cultural heritage. The Government’s recent initiative of free entry to historical monuments and places of cultural interest on the occasion of our country’s 75th Independence Day was a great way to increase footfall to these places. The government should consider taking up other initiatives like updating websites and improving transportation so that footfall to these places is further increased.
          </p>
          <p>
           I hope you will publish my letter in your newspaper so that more people would have the experience of these wonderful sites and feel proud of our beautiful city.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The given pie-chart depicts a survey conducted by a leading daily wherein students of Class X expressed their job preferences. Students who wanted to pursue the Teaching profession were 20% and an equal percentage of students wanted to be IT professionals. 15% of the students wanted to be Fashion Designers and another 15% chose to be Scientists. Pursuing a career of doctors, engineers and photographers was a choice of 10% students respectively. It was heartening to note that all the students were quite sure about the career they wanted to opt for after school.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (b) The given graph compares the consumption of health care supplements amongst men and women between the age-group of 25 – 35 from the year 2018 – 2022 in terms of their sales. The annual sales consumption of health care supplements was rather low in 2018. In the year 2019, their sale rose up by about 10 lakhs units each amongst men and women. In 2020 their sale hiked up by another 10 lakhs units each and peaked in the year 2021. This rise in sale could be attributed to the COVID pandemic wherein the value of consuming health care supplements greatly increased. But surprisingly, the sales amongst men dropped to 2020 level whereas in women’s category the sales dropped by 5 lakh units.

           Question 8.

           (d) The quarrel over Green Meadows is finally resolved. Explain.
           <br/>
           (e) Amanda gets a list of instructions from her mother of do’s and don’ts. What do these tell you about the relationship between Amanda and her mother?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (d) Both Lomov and Natalya claim ownership over Green Meadows. Chubukov and Nata’va insult Lomov and the latter stomps out of their house. However, when Natalya gets to know that Lomov had come to propose to her, she relents and sends her father to bring Lomov back, thus resolving their quarrel.
          </p>
          <p>
           (e) Amanda was fed up of her mother’s constant nagging and her list of instructions of do’s and don’ts. Amanda was rather frustrated and unhappy by her mother’s continuous blabbering. Her mother has high expectations from her, which Amanda is unable to live upto. So t; eir relationship is strained and disagreeable.

           Sir
           <br/>
           Through the medium of the columns of your esteemed newspaper I wish to share my views on the role of media in promoting national integration.
          </p>
          <p>
           Recently I worked on a school project on the powerful impact of media in promoting national integration. It is quite evident that media has played a pivotal role in bringing about soli¬darity and national cohesion in the country. It keeps people informed about national issues. Media acts as a guard when forces work against the integrity and solidarity of our nation. During a national crisis media plays a vital role as a tool for crisis management.
          </p>
          <p>
           Thus, we cannot deny the important role of media in nurturing national integration.
          </p>
          <p>
           I hope you will publish my letter in your newspaper so that the role of media in promoting national integration is reiterated in the readers.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Global weather has been undergoing a drastic change and global warming is responsible for creating arctic meltdowns. The given pie-chart analyses the reasons for climatic change. The two major factors that are mainly responsible for this climatic change are energy/electricity generation (33%) and fumes generates by various means of transport (27%). Together these two factors take precedence over other reasons (60%) for climatic change. Industry and agriculture contribute about 26% toward global warming and then there are residential, commercial and other factors totaling 14% that also bring about climatic change.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (b) The given bar chart depicts the percentage growth in different sectors in a developing country from the year 2012 to 2022. Education saw the sharpest hike of 25% in 2012 as compared to 12% in 2022. The growth of the private sector has remained quite steady in ten years. The Govt sector is stagnant and has not registered any growth at all. Medical sector has risen by about 5% in ten years and transport sector too has gone up by about 5% whereas agriculture has seen a decline of 5% in ten years.
