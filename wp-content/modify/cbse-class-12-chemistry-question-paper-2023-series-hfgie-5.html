           Question 7.
           <br/>
           1 mole of liquid A and 2 moles of liquid B make a solution having a total vapour pressure 40 torr. The vapour pressure of pure A and pure B are 45 torr and 30 torr respectively. The above solution
           <br/>
           (a) is an ideal solution.
           <br/>
           (b) shows positive deviation.
           <br/>
           (c) shows negative deviation.
           <br/>
           (d) is a maximum boiling azeotrope.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (b) shows positive deviation.
          </p>
          <p>
           Total moles = 3
           <br/>
           According to Raoult’s law

           × \(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{A}}^{\mathrm{o}}\) = \(\frac{1}{3}\) × 45 = 15 torr ; P
           <sub>
            B

           = x
           <sub>
            B
           </sub>
           × \(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{B}}^{\circ}\) = \(\frac{2}{3}\) × 30 = 20 torr Expected pressure = 15 + 20 = 35 torr ; Actual pressure = 40 torr
           <br/>
           ∴ Actual pressure &gt; Expected pressure
           <br/>
           As It does not obey Raoult’s law, it shows positive deviation.

           Question 22.
           <br/>
           Why is boiling point of o-dichlorobenzene higher than p-dichlorobenzene but melting point of para isomer is higher than ortho isomer.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The boiling point of o-dichlorobenzene is greater than the p-isomer due to its greater polar nature but the melting point of p-dichlorobenzerte is greater than o-isomer due to more symmetric nature of p-isomer where it fits in crystal lattice better as compared to o-isomer. As a result of this, intermolecular forces of attraction become stronger in para-isomer and therefore greater energy is required to break its lattice and it melts at higher temperature.

           Question 23.
           <br/>
           For the pair phenol and cyclohexanol, answer the following: [2 × 1 = 2]
          </p>
          <p>
           (a) Why is phenol more acidic than cyclohexanol?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Phenol is more acidic than cyclohexanol because the conjugate base of phenol is much more stable than conjugate base of cyclohexanol. Moreover the conjugate base of phenol can delocalize the negative charge throughout the ring through resonance and stabilize it effectively, whereas conjugate base of cyclohexanol has no resonance structures to stabilize the charge and so is less stable.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           Penta-acetate of glucose does not have a free — OH group at Cl and therefore, cannot be converted to the open chain form to give — CHO group, hence it does not form the oxime.

           (b) Amino acids behave like salts.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Amino acids behave like salts due to the presence of both acidic and basic groups in the same molecule. In aqueous solution, the carboxyl group can lose a proton, an amino group can accept a proton and giving rise to a dipolar ion known as zwitter ion.

           (c) Water soluble vitamins must be taken regularly in diet.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Water soluble vitamins dissolve in water and are not stored by the body. Moreover, they are eliminated from the body in the form of urine, so we require a continuous supply of these vitamins in our diet.

           (d) The two strands in DNA are complimentary to each other.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           DNA has double helical structure, contains two strands which are held together by hydrogen bonds between specific pairs of bases. Cytosine forms hydrogen bond with guanine, while adenine forms H-bond with thymine. Thus, the sequence of bases in one strand automatically determines that of the other. Hence, the 2 strands of DNA are complementary to each other.

           1? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>

           <sub>
            N
           </sub>
           1 reaction, a carbocation intermediate is formed which is a planar molecule and can lead to form d- and l[- products. Hence racemisation occurs.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Why is ethanol less polar than water? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Ethanol is less polar than water because in water, two hydrogen atoms are bonded to an oxygen while in ethanol, one hydrogen atom and one alkyl group are bonded to an oxygen.

           (a) (i) Why is boiling point of 1M NaCl solution more than that of 1M glucose solution?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Since NaCl is ionic and completely dissociates to give 2 ions per molecule which is not possible in glucose. So NaCl requires more heat to break its strong crystal lattice and thus have high boiling point. Moreover, both have same molality but Van’t Hoff factor of NaCl is more than glucose.

           (ii) Why are the boiling point of aldehydes and ketones lower than that of corresponding carboxylic acids?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The boiling point of aldehydes and ketones are lower than that of corresponding carboxylic acids because of their polar nature due to which they have sufficient intermolecular dipole-dipole interaction between the opposite ends of C = O dipoles but this dipole-dipole interaction becomes weaker than intermolecular H-bonding in carboxylic acids.

           (ii) Why is the Œ-hydrogens of aldehydes and ketones are acidic in nature?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The α-hydrogen atoms of aldehydes and ketones are slightly acidic in nature due to strong electron withdrawing inductive (-I) effect of the carbonyl group. The acidity is also due to resonance stabilization of the conjugate base. Due to —I effect it withdraws electrons from the adjacent C—C bond which makes α-carbon e

            –
           </sup>

           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Chemistry of actinoids is complicated as compared to lanthanoids due to its more radioactive elements. They are present in small quantities and their half life is extremely small. Moreover, they shows more variable oxidation states than lanthanoids and their 5f orbital is more exposed to outer environment while 4f orbital of lanthanoids are deeply buried.

           by reduction.
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) The highest melting point of Cr is attributed to the involvement of greater number of unpaired electrons (d
           <sup>
            5
           </sup>
           ) from 3d in addition to 4s electrons in interatomic bonding. Therefore metallic bonding is maximum and has high melting point.
           <br/>
           Mn has exceptionally low melting point due to stable half-filled 3d orbital which is more tightly held by the nucleus. This reduces the de-localization of electrons resulting in weaker metallic bonding due to low interatomic forces of attraction and is easier to break.

           Assertion (A) : The half life of a reaction is the time in which the concentration of the reactant
           <br/>
           is reduced to one half of its initial concentration.
           <br/>
           Reason (R) : In first order kinetics when concentration of reactant is doubled, its half life is
           <br/>
           doubled. [1]

           Reason (R) : Carboxyl group increases the electron density at the meta position. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (c) Assertion (A) is true, hut Reason (R) is false.
          </p>
          <p>
           Carboxyl group is an electron withdrawing group and it decreases electron density at ‘O’ and ‘P’ position but not increase the e density at ‘m’ position while it directs the electrophile at (m) (meta position) due to its meta directing nature.

           (iii) Actinoids show more number of oxidation states than lanthanoids. [1 + 1 + 3 = 5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Actinoids show more number of oxidation states than lanthanoids because its 5f, 6d and 7s energy levels are of comparable energies and they all participate in bonding. Moreover, poor shielding of 5f orbitals than 4f orbitals is also responsible for this.

           and (d) as given below:
           <br/>
           (a) Both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are true and Reason (R) is the correct explanation of the Assertion (A).
           <br/>
           (b) Both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) arc true, but Reason (R) is not the correct explanation of Assertion (A).
           <br/>
           (c) Assertion (A) is true, but Reason (R) is false.
           <br/>
           (d) Assertion (A) is false, but Reason (R) is true.

          <p>
           Question 15.
           <br/>
           Assertion (A) : The backbone of DNA and RNA molecules is a chain consisting of heterocyclic base, pentose sugar and phosphate group.
           <br/>
           Reason (R) : Nucleotides and nucleosides mainly differ from each other in presence of phosphate group.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (b) Both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) arc true, but Reason (R) is not the correct explanation of Assertion (A).

           Question 16.
           <br/>
           Assertion (A) : Order of reaction is applicable to elementary as well as complex reactions.
           <br/>
           Reason (R) : For a complex reaction molecularity has no meaning. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (b) Both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are true, but Reason (R) is not the correct explanation of Assertion (A).
          </p>
          <p>
           Since a complex reaction proceeds through several steps and each step has its own molecularity which may be different. So, molecularity of overall complex reaction is meaningless. On the other hand, order of a complex reaction is determined by the slowest step in its mechanism and is not meaningless even in the case of elementary reactions.

           compound.
           <br/>
           Reason (R) : α, β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds are stahilised due to conjugation. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are true and Reason (R) is the correct explanation of the Assertion (A).

           Question 22.
           <br/>
           Why haloarenes are not reactive towards nucleophilic substitution reaction? Give two reasons.
           <br/>
           [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Haloarenes are not reactive towards nucleophilic substitution reaction due to following reasons:
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) The e” pairs of halogen atom are in conjugation with the benzene ring through resonance and C —Cl bond acquires a partial double character which makes its cleavage very difficult for S

            N

           (ii) The sp
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
           hybridised carbon of haloarene has greater s character and is more electronegative due to which it holds the e
           <sup>
            –
           </sup>
           pair more tightly which reduces its (C — X) bond length and imparts its stability and hence the cleavage of bond becomes difficult.

           (ii) Copper has exceptionally positive \(\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{M}}^{\mathrm{o}}{ }^{2+} / \mathrm{M}\) value.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The \(\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{M}^{\prime 2+} / \mathrm{M}}\) value for metal depends on atomization enthalpy, ionization enthalpy and hydration enthalpy. Copper has a high value of atomisation enthalpy and low hydration enthalpy as a result of which, the overall \(\mathrm{E}^0 \mathrm{M}^{2+} / \mathrm{M}\) for Copper becomes positive.
