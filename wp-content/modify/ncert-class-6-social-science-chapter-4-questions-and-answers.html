            The Big Questions (Page 59)
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           How do we measure historical time?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) BC: The letters BC means Before Christ: Dates are generally counted (i.e., the day, the month and the years) or assigned to the birth of Jesus Christ, the founder of Christianity so 2000 BC means 2000 years before the birth of Jesus Christ. All dates before the birth of Jesus Christ are counted backwards and generally have the letter BC or BCE (Before Christ) added on.
           <br/>
           (b) AD: We sometimes find AD before dates. This stands for two Latin words, “Anno Domini”, and mean in the year of the lord (i.e., Jestrs Christ). For example, 2008 can also be written as AD 2008 or 2008 AD or 2008 CE.
           <br/>
           (c) CE: Sometimes, CE is used instead of AD. The letters CE stands for ‘Common Era’.
           <br/>
           (d) BCE: Sometimes BCE is used instead of BC. The letters BCE stands for ‘Before Common Era’. We use these terms because the Christian Era is now used in the most countries of the world.
           <br/>
           (e) Script: Way .or style of writing of a language is called a script. It consists of letters or signs. For example, ‘Devnagri’ is a script of Hindi.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           How can various sources help us understand history?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Various sources play a crucial role in helping us understand history by providing diverse perspectives, detailed evidence, and contextual insights. Here’s how different types of sources contribute to our understanding of history:
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Primary Sources: Original documents or physical objects created during the time under study. For example-inscriptions, ancient literature, letters, diaries, official documents, photographs, artifacts, and newspapers.
           </li>
           <li>
            Secondary Sources: Works that interpret, analyze, or summarise primary sources. For example: Books, articles, documentaries, and reviews.
           </li>
           <li>
            Oral Histories: Recorded interviews and spoken accounts from individuals who experienced or witnessed historical events. For example: Interviews,
            <br/>
            recordings, and transcriptions.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           How did early humans live?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Early humans, also known as Paleolithic humans, lived during the Old Stone Age, which spanned from approximately 2.5 million to 10,000 years ago.
           <br/>
           (a) Nomadic Hunter-gatherers: They traveled in small groups, following animals and seasonal food sources. They hunted animals, gathered fruits, nuts, and plants, and fished.
           <br/>
           (b) Shelters: They constructed simple shelters using natural materials like branches, animal hides, and stones.
           <br/>
           (c) Tools: They created stone tools, like flint knives, hand axes, and scrapers, to aid in hunting and processing food.
           <br/>
           (d) Clothing: They likely wore animal hides, furs, and woven fibers for clothing and protection.

          </div>
          <p>
           1. Hunting and Gathering: Early humans in rock shelters engaged in hunting animals and gathering wild plants for food. Evidence of this activity includes remains of animal bones, tools made from stone and bone, and plant remnants.
          </p>
          <p>
           2. Tool Making: Stone tools, such as hand axes, scrapers, and arrowheads, were crafted by early humans in rock shelters. These tools were essential for hunting, processing food, and other daily tasks. The presence of flakes and cores indicates the tool-making process.
          </p>
          <p>
           3. Fire Making and Usage: Fire played a crucial role in the lives of early humAnswer:It was used for cooking food, providing warmth, and protecting against predators. Charcoal deposits, ash layers, and hearths found in rock shelters are evidence of fire usage.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
          </div>
          <p>
           4. Art and Symbolism: Rock shelters often feature prehistoric art, including paintings and carvings on the walls. These artworks depict animals, human figures, and abstract symbols, reflecting early human culture, beliefs, and communication methods.
          </p>
          <p>
           5. Shelter and Living Spaces: Rock shelters served as living spaces, providing protection from harsh weather and predators. Evidence of structured living areas, such as sleeping spots, storage areas, and communal spaces, indicates how early humans organized their living quarters.
          </p>
          <p>
           6. Social and Ritual Activities: Evidence suggests that rock shelters were also used for social and ritual activities. This includes the presence of burial sites, ritualistic objects, and communal spaces where groups of early humans might have gathered for ceremonies or social interactions.
          </p>
          <p>
           7. Food Preparation: Early humans prepared food in rock shelters, as indicated by grinding stones, hearths, and remains of processed plant and animal materials. These activities included cooking, butchering animals, and processing plants for consumption.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           An agricultural community from a few millennia ago would have engaged in a variety of activities essential for their survival and livelihood. Here are some main activities we can identify:

           Question 1.
           <br/>
           As a project, write the history of your family (or milage if you live in one), using sources of history at your disposal. Ask your teacher to guide you.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           These questions need to be attempted by the students themselves. Here we have provided a sample answer:
           <br/>
           We live in a small village called Roshanpur in U.P. Through the Gram Panchayat we came to know various historical facts about the village. The village ancestors first moved in around 1500 years back, i.e., around 500 A.D.
          </p>
          <p>
           My Paternal Great-Grandfather was Amar Singh, farmer, born in 1910 in this village. I got this informationifrom family stories and an old photograph.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Can we compare historians to detectives? Give reasons for your answers.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Yes, historians can be compared to detectives for several reasons including their Investigative approach, their way of analysing evidence, the way they construct narratives, the manner they give attention to detail and also for their problem-solving skills. We can further detail this as

           (b) If King Chandragupta was born in 320 CE, which century did he belong to? And how many years was that after the Buddha’s birth?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           King Chandragupta was bom in the 4th century CE.
           <br/>
           Given King Chandragupta was bom in 320 CE. BuddhaJ was bom in 560 BCE.
           <br/>
           Hence 560 + 320 – 1 = 880 – 1 = 879 years
           <br/>
           That means King Chandragupta was born 879 years after the Buddha’s birth.
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) Rani of Jhansi was born in 1828. Which century did she belong to? How many years was that before India’s Independence?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Rani of Jhansi was born in the 19th century CE. India gained independence in 1947.
           <br/>
           Hence:
           <br/>
           1947- 1828 = 119 years
           <br/>
           That means Rani of Jhansi was born 119 years before the India’s independence.

           (d) Turn ‘12,000 years ago’ into a date.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Assuming the current year is 2024 CE, 12,000 years ago would be 12,000 – 2024 + 1= 9977 BCE.

           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Plan a visit to a nearby museum: the visit should be prepared with some prior research on the kind of exhibits the museum holds. Keep notes during the visit. Write a brief report afterwards, highlighting what was unexpected/interesting/fun about the wsit and the exhibits.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           These questions need to be attempted by the students themselves. Here we-have provided some sample answers.
          </p>
          <p>
           Museum Visit Report
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Preparation: Before visiting the National Museum, I got in touch with them through their online website and found that it houses artifacts from ancient India. The exhibit featured artifacts such as terracotta figurines, pottery, seals, and jewellery from the various eras of Indian history.
           </li>
           <li>
            During the Visit: I was keeping and maintaining the notes on the different sections, specifically focusing on the Harappan Gallery, the Mauryan and Gupta Era artifacts, the art section related to Buddhist era, Medieval Indian Art and Sculpture and Textiles and Decorative Arts.
           </li>
           <li>
            Report: The visit to the National Museum was very enriching. The most interesting was the Harappan pottery, which displayed commendable craftsmanship. The exhibit featured artifacts such as terracotta, pottery, seals, and jewellery from the Harappan civilisation.
            <br/>
            Contemporary Art was another attraction and it housed modern and contemporary artworks by prominent Indian artists which provided a contrast to the historical collections. These works highlighted the dynamic and evolving nature of Indian art in the contemporary era.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
