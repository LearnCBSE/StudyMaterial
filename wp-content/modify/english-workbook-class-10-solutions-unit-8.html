          <p>
           A.1.
           <br/>
           When we compare we estimate, measure or note the similarity or dissimilarity between two or more people, places, things or ideas. And we often compare them in terms of size, shape, weight, colour, quality, manner, number, quantity, grade, actions, intensity, age, looks, feelings etc.
          </p>

          <p>
           Do you know what term is used for the class of words we use for comparison ?
          </p>
          <p>
           In this unit you will learn the various ways of comparing in English. You will also get some practice in using them.

           <strong>
            Note:
           </strong>
           The focus above is on the grammar concept of ‘Comparatives’, well-supported by its elaborate clarification.
          </p>
          <p>
           A. 2.
           <br/>
           Study the table below and notice how the words of comparison are used.
           <br/>
           See Workbook on Page 133
           <br/>
           Have you noticed that the above examples have expressions like as … as, more … than, -er… than, the … -est or the most…. ? Why ? Discuss with a partner. The examples in the following table can give you some clues to the answer.

           For many parents, especially those who are poor and illiterate, a girl is a ‘lesser child’. Doesn’t it make you mad to know that girls aren’t given an equal chance to be born ? Though female infanticide was banned by law over a century ago, thousands of girls are killed before they are born or when they are babies.
          </p>
          <p>
           Even the girls who are allowed to survive live with less of everything. ________ girls are sent to school ________ boys. They get ________ medical care, so ________ girls die. Boys get ________ nutritious food and also ________ time to play. ________ jobs are open to girls, and even if they are employed, they are not paid ________ as boys. Most of all, they get ________ respect. They are not given as ________ opportunities as boys to speak out on matters that concern them. And yet a girl usually does twice as ________ work ________ a boy, not only in the house but also in the fields.

          <p>
           This is to apprise the honourable members of the Management Committee that as much as a quarter of the total money has been earmarked for organising the Cultural Extravaganza. Fortunately, the participation of the girls will be more than that of the boys. The expenses on procuring sports equipment and tentage will be twice as much as was previously estimated. Even the number of mementoes, trophies and certificates will be about three times more than that of the last year’s sum-total. As far as the budget for refreshments is concerned, it is going to be far more than what was planned. However, the financial support from different sources is as encouraging as it was the last year.

           <br/>
           expensive,cheap, good,costly,low
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Goods this year are costlier than last year, and next year things may be more expensive than they are now.
          </p>
          <p>
           Here are some suggestions for saving money ! Compare the prices of similar products. Some brands are cheaper than others, but the quality may not be much lower.
          </p>
          <p>
           Before you go shopping make a list of the items that you need and buy only those things ! Don’t buy things that you don’t need just because they are cheaper than the usual price, and don’t buy anything just to ‘keep up’ with your neighbours.

           Apes are in many ways similar to humans. The skeleton of an ape resembles the skeleton of a human and it has the same number of teeth as a human has. An ape’s brain is smaller than the brain of a human, but its structure is the same as the structure of a human brain. It is not surprising then, that apes behave rather like humans behave.

           <br/>
           As whalers reduced catches of the larger whales, they switched to smaller species. This is evident when we compare figures for the Antarctic catch of the larger sei whale with those for small minke whale. In 1985, fifteen times as many sei whales as minke whales were caught. By 1995, catches of both the species were virtually the same (9000). By the 2000, the situation had reversed and the number of minke whales killed was more than doubled as compared to sei whales (6000). The graph shows that while the sei catch was reduced by 95% between 1985 and 2010, over the same period the minke whale catch was eight times greater. If these trends continue, the situation for the smaller species will be as bad as it used to be for the larger ones.

           As whalers reduced catches of the larger whales, they switched to
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            smaller
           </span>
           species. This is evident when we compare figures for the Antarctic catch of the larger sei whale with
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            those
           </span>
           for small minke whale. In 1985,
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            fifteen times as many
           </span>
           sei whales

            as
           </span>
           minke whales were caught. By 1995, catches of both the species were virtually the
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            same
           </span>
           (9000). By the 2000, the situation had reversed and the number of minke whales killed was
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            more than doubled
           </span>
           as compared to sei whales (6000). The graph shows that while the sei catch was reduced by 95% between 1985 and 2010, over the same period the minke whale catch was
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            eight times greater
           </span>
           . If these trends continue, the situation for the smaller species will be
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            as bad as
           </span>
           it used to be for the larger ones.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           It can be seen from the graph that on the whole, time spent by the students on viewing TV between 1985 and 2010 has been increasing ; and on reading for pleasure, it has been decreasing. For instance in the year 1985, students spent hardly any time per week on watching TV as against fourteen hours spent by them on reading for pleasure. In the year 2010, they spent only three-fourth as much time reading as they did in 1985. If the present trends continue, the students by the year 2015 would be spending their time on viewing TV, a little more. It would be almost four times higher than on reading for pleasure.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           As can be seen from the above pie chart, nearly a quarter of the class thought. TV advertising should be banned completely. Just under a quarter thought advertisements should be on TV only after 9 pm. About another quarter felt that advertising of only certain products like alcohol should be banned. A small minority, however, thought that there should be no restrictions. Slightly less than a quarter thought that advertising should be censored.

           <br/>
           As we can see from the above chart, slightly less than half believed that young people should be considered independent when they reach the age of eighteen. Almost a quarter felt, they should attain the independent stature only when they are twenty one. A small minority, however, thought that independence is spontaneous when one gets a job. A few felt that age was not the criteria to become independent.
