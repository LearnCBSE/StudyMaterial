           <br/>
           As, electron has negative charge, F
           <sub>
            e
           </sub>
           = – e(v × B)
           <br/>
           ∴ The direction of force on electron is opposite to the direction of v × B i.e. in +z-direction.

           Question 6.
           <br/>
           The relative permeability of a substance X is slightly less than unity and that of substance Y is slightly more than unity, then
           <br/>
           (a) X is paramagnetic and Y is ferromagnetic
           <br/>
           (b) X is diamagnetic and Y is ferromagnetic
           <br/>
           (c) X and Y both are paramagnetic
           <br/>
           (d) X is diamagnetic and Y is paramagnetic
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (d) X is diamagnetic and Y is paramagnetic
          </p>
          <p>
           The relative permeability of a substance, μ

            r
           </sub>
           = 1 +χ
           <br/>
           For diamagnetic substance, χ = -ve
           <br/>
           μ
           <sub>
            r
           </sub>
           &lt; 1
           <br/>
           For paramagnetic substance, χ = + ve
           <br/>
           μ
           <sub>
            r
           </sub>
           &gt; 1
           <br/>
           Hence, X is diamagnetic and Y is paramagnetic substance.

           Assertion (A) Putting p-type semiconductor slab directly in physical contact with n-type semiconductor slab cannot form the p-n junction.
           <br/>
           Reason (R) The roughness at contact will be mhch more than inter-atomic crystal spacing and continuous flow of charge carriers is not possible.
           <br/>
           Answer:

           Assertion (A) Propagation of light through an optical fibre is due to total internal reflection taking place at the core-cladding interface.
           <br/>
           Reason (R) Refractive index of the material of the cladding of the optical fibre is greater than that of the core.

           From given figure in question
           <br/>
           (i) Consider the case r &lt; a. The amperian loop is a circle labelled 1.
           <br/>
           For this loop, taking the radius of the circle to be r,
           <br/>
           L = 2πr
           <br/>
           Now, the current enclosed i
           <sub>
            e
           </sub>
           is not i, but is less than this value.
           <br/>
           Since, the current distribution is uniform, the current enclosed,
           <br/>
           i
           <sub>

           Using Ampere’s law, B(2πr) = μ
           <sub>
            0
           </sub>
           \(\frac{ir^2}{a^2}\)
           <br/>
           B = (\(\frac{μ_0 i}{2\pi a^2}\))r
           <br/>
           ⇒ B ∝ r (r &lt; a) (ii) Consider the case r &gt; a. The amperian loop, labelled 2, is a circie concentric with the cross-section.
           <br/>
           For this loop, L = 2πr
           <br/>
           Using Ampere circuital law, we can write
           <br/>
           B(2πr) = μ
           <sub>

           B = \(\frac{μ_0 i}{2\pi r}\)

           <br/>
           (iii) X-ray is used to study crystal structure.
           <br/>
           Method of the production
           <br/>
           (i) Infrared is produced by a non-luminous generator in which an electric current is passed through a coil.
           <br/>
           (ii) Ultraviolet ray is produced by mercury-vapour lamp.

           Question 29.
           <br/>
           Read the following paragraph and answer the questions that follows.
           <br/>
           A semiconductor diode is basically a p-n junction with metallic contacts provided at the ends for the application of an external voltage. It is a two terminal device. When an external voltage is applied across a semiconductor diode, such that p-side is connected to the positive terminal of the battery and n-side to the negative terminal, it is said to be forward biased. Whan an external voltage is applied across the diode, such that n-side is positive and p-side is negative, it is said to be reverse biased.
           <br/>
           An ideal diode is one whose resistance in forward biasing is zero and the resistance is infinite in reverse biasing. When the diode is forward biased, it is found that beyond forward voltage called knee voltage, the conductivity is very high. When the biasing voltage is more than the knee voltage, the potential barrier is overcome and the current increases rapidly with increase in forward voltage. When the diode is reverse biased, the reverse bias voltage produces a very small current about a few microamperes which almost remains constant with bias. This small current is reverse saturation current.
           <br/>
           (i) In the given figure, a diode D is connected to an external resistance R = 100 Ω and an emf of 3.5 V If the barrier potential developed across the diode is 0.5 V the current in the circuit will be

           The magnification of an image by convex lens is positive only when the object is placed between focal point (F) and optical centre, because image formed by the convex lens for this location object is virtual and magnified and for real image, m = – ve.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           (c) 26.66 cm
          </p>
          <p>
           Given, f + 20 cm, m = -3 = \(\frac{v}{u}\)
           <br/>
           = v = -3u
           <br/>
           By lens formula, \(\frac{1}{v}-\frac{1}{u}=\frac{1}{f}\)
           <br/>
           \(\frac{1}{-3 u}-\frac{1}{u}=\frac{1}{20}\)
           <br/>
           u = -26.66 cm
           <br/>
           ∴ Distance of the object = -26.66 cm
