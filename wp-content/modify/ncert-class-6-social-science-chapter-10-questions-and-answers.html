           Democracy is a system of government in which people choose their own rulers. The word ‘democracy’ comes from two Greek words—demos meaning ‘people’, and kratos meaning ‘rule’ or ‘power’; so ‘democracy’ literally means the ‘rule of the people’.

           <li>
            Every people have an equal chance to attain the highest post like Prime Minister, the President, the Chief Justice and Army Chief.
           </li>
           <li>
            Every one has freedom, right to, express their opinion, choose their religion, etc.
           </li>
           <li>
            Democracy gives power to people to choose, change and criticise their own government.

           <br/>
           Explain how the three government organs are at work in the case of the cyber criminals described above. How do they intervene? (Page 154)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Digital technologies have eased the life of people and at the same time created a new class of criminals who, finds digital ways of stealing people’s money.
           <br/>
           To prevent cybercrime government (legislative) has pass new laws in order to fight such criminal activities. Many criminals, who have been involved in robbing innocent people of their hard-earned money, have been arrested (executive) and convicted in court (judiciary). They are usually fined as well as jailed for some years.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 8.
           <br/>
           As a class activity, can you imagine the sort of disorder we might witness if all three organs were under the control of the same group of people? Can you describe any such real-life situation you may have heard of? (Page 155)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           If all three organs of the government—executive, legislative, and judicial were under the control of the same group of people, then it will create imbalances in social order and society.
           <br/>
           It will lead to discrimination and rise of injustice to common people. This may lead to corruption and inefficient administration. A news system of undemocratic government may come in place of people’s rule.
          </p>
          <p>
           Real-life situation
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Saudi Arabia— Monarchical Rule
           </li>
           <li>
            North Korea— Military Rule
           </li>
           <li>
            Germany— Under Adolf Hitler
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           For instance, Germany during 1933-1942 was under Nazi rule led by the military dictator Adolf Hitler. He took all the decisions regarding the running of the government. All the other organs of the government were under military rule.
           <br/>
           He had special forces, security services and specialised military team to create fear and havoc. Hitler and his supporters, just to enhance their personal ego killed many people in gas chambers. They also created conditions that led to World War II affecting and killings millions of people worldwide.

           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Test yourself – What is the meaning of democracy? What is the difference between direct democracy and representative democracy?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Democracy is a system of government in which people choose their own rulers. The word ‘democracy’ comes from two Greek words — demos meaning ‘people’, and kratos meaning ‘rule’ or ‘power’; so ‘democracy’ means the ‘rule of the people’.
           <br/>
           Direct and representative are part of democratic government and they mainly differs on the process of decision making.
