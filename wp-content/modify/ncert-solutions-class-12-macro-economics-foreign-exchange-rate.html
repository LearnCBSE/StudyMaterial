            Answer:
           </strong>
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Exchange rate in a free exchange market is determined at a point, where demand for foreign exchange is equal to the supply of foreign exchange.
           </li>
           <li>
            Let us assume that there are two countries – India and U.S.A – and the exchange rate of their currencies i.e., rupee and dollar is to be determined.
            <br/>
            Presently, there is floating or flexible exchange regime in both India and U.S.A. Therefore, the value of currency of each country in terms of the other currency depends upon the demand for and supply of their currencies.
           </li>
           <li>
            In the above diagram, the price on the vertical axis is stated in terms of domestic currency (that is, how many rupees for one US dollar). The horizontal axis measures the quantity demanded or supplied.
           </li>
           <li>
            In the above diagram, the demand curve [D$] is downward sloping. This means that less foreign exchange is demanded as the exchange rate increases. This is due to the fact that the rise in price of foreign exchange increases the rupee cost of foreign goods, which make them more expensive. As a result, imports decline. Thus, the demand for foreign exchange also decreases.
            <br/>
            The supply curve [S$] is upward sloping which means that supply of foreign exchange increases as the exchange rate increases. This makes home country’s goods become cheaper to foreigners since rupee is depreciating in value. The demand for our exports should therefore increase as the exchange rate increases. The increased demand for our exports translates into greater supply of foreign exchange. Thus, the supply of foreign exchange increases as the exchange rate increases.

            Answer:
           </strong>
           The demand for foreign currency rises in the following situations:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            When price of a foreign currency falls, imports from that, foreign, country become cheaper. So, imports increase and hence, the demand for foreign currency rises.
            <br/>
            For example, if price of 1 US dollar falls from Rs 60 to T 55, then imports from The USA will increase as American goods will become relatively cheaper. It will raise the demand for US dollar.
           </li>
           <li>
            When a foreign currency becomes cheaper in terms of the domestic currency, it promotes tourism to that country. As a result, demand for foreign currency rises.
           </li>
           <li>
            When price of a foreign currency falls, its demand rises as more people want to make gains from speculative activities.

          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Demand curve of foreign exchange slopes downwards due to inverse relationship between demand for foreign exchange and foreign exchange rate.
           </li>
           <li>
            In figure, demand for foreign exchange (US dollar) and rate of foreign exchange are shown on the horizontal axis and vertical axis respectively.
           </li>
           <li>
            The demand curve [US$] is downward sloping. It means that less foreign exchange is demanded as the exchange rate increases.
           </li>
           <li>
            This is due to the fact that rise in the price of foreign exchange increases the rupee cost of foreign goods, which make them more expensive. As a result, imports decline. Thus, the demand for foreign exchange also decreases.

            Answer:
           </strong>
           The supply of foreign currency rises in the following situations:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            When price of a foreign currency rises, domestic goods become relatively cheaper. It induces the foreign country to increase their imports from the domestic country. As a result, supply of foreign currency rises. For example, if price of 1 US dollar rises from Rs 60 to Rs 65, then exports to USA will increase as Indian goods will become relatively cheaper. It will raise the supply of US dollars.
           </li>
           <li>
            When price of a foreign currency rises,foreign direct investment (FDI) from rest of the world increases, which will increase the supply for foreign exchange.
           </li>
           <li>
            When price of a foreign currency rises, also supply of foreign currency rises as people want to make gains from speculative activities.

            Answer:
           </strong>
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Supply curve of foreign exchange slopes upwards due to positive relationship between supply for foreign exchange and foreign exchange rate, which means that supply of foreign exchange increases as the exchange rate increases.
           </li>
           <li>
            This makes home country’s goods become cheaper to foreigners since rupee is depreciating in value. The demand for our exports should therefore increase as the exchange rate increases.
           </li>
           <li>
            The increased demand for our exports will translate into greater supply of foreign exchange. Thus, the supply of foreign exchange increases as the exchange rate increases.

            Answer:
           </strong>
           Depreciation of domestic currency means a fall in the price of domestic currency (say, rupee) in terms of a foreign currency (say, $). It means, with the same amount of dollars, more goods can be purchased from India, i.e., exports to USA will increase as they will become relatively cheaper.

            Answer:
           </strong>
           Appreciation of domestic currency means a rise in the price of domestic currency (say, rupee) in terms of a foreign currency (say, $). Now, one rupee can be exchanged for more $, i.e., with the same amount of money, more goods can be purchased from the USA. It leads to increase in imports from the USA as American goods will become relatively cheaper.

           The role of the Central Bank in maintaining the foreign exchange rates under different regimes is:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Fixed exchange rate system:
            </strong>
            A Central Bank actively uses its foreign currency reserves to maintain the officially determined exchange rate.
           </li>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Floating exchange rate system:
            </strong>
            A Central Bank does not maintain any reserves of foreign currency as the market automatically adjusts to determine the market driven exchange rate
           </li>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Managed Floating:
            </strong>
            A Central Bank enters the foreign exchange market to buy/sell foreign currency in order to control fluctuations and volatility in the market.

            Answer:
           </strong>
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Devaluation refers to reduction in price of domestic currency in terms of all foreign currencies under fixed exchange rate regime, i.e., (It takes place due to government) .
           </li>
           <li>
            Depreciation refers to fall in market price of domestic currency in terms of a foreign currency under flexible exchange rate regime, i.e., (It takes place due to market forces of demand and supply)
           </li>
           <li>
            Currency Depreciation and Currency Devaluation may result into increase in exports of the goods and services from the country since it would increase the global competiveness of the goods.
