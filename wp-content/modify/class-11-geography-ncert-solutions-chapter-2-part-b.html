           <br/>
           If a person is to travel to Lakshadweep, from which coastal plain does he prefer and why?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Lakshadweep islands are situated in Arabian Sea. These islands are located at a distance of 280 km-480 km off the Kerala coast. Its distance is lowest from Malabar Coast. Therefore, it will take us least time to reach at Lakshadweep islands from Malabar Coast.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The north-eastern part of the Kashmir Himalayas is a cold desert, which lies between the Greater Himalayas and the Karakoram ranges. Main ranges of this region are Laddakh, Karakoram, Jasker and Pir Panjal.

           <br/>
           Why is the western coastal plain is devoid of any delta?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The slope of rivers of western coast is very steep. Therefore, these rivers flow not in different parts but in one part. And hence they do not form any delta. As a result, we do not find any delta in the western coast.

           Question 3(ii).
           <br/>
           What are the important geomorphological features found in the river valley plains?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Alluvial fans are formed when streams flowing from higher levels break into foot slope plains of low gradient. Normally very coarse load is carried by streams flowing over mountain slopes. This load becomes too heavy for the streams to be carried over gentler gradients and gets dumped and spread as a broad low to high cone shaped deposit called alluvial fan. Usually, the streams which flow over fans are not confined to their original channels for long and shift their position across the fan forming many channels called distributaries. Alluvial fans in humid areas show normally low cones with gentle slope form as a low cone.
          </p>
          <p>
           Delta is like alluvial fans but develop at a different location. The load carried by the rivers is dumped and spread into the sea. If this load is not carried away far into the sea or distributed along the coast, it spreads and accumulates. Such areas over flood plains built up by abandoned or cut¬off channels contain coarse deposits. The flood deposits of spilled waters carry relatively finer materials like silt and clay. The flood plains in a delta are called delta plains.
          </p>
          <p>
           Floodplain is a major landform of river deposition. Large sized materials are deposited first when stream channel breaks into a gentle slope. Thus, normally, fine sized materials like sand, silt and clay are carried by relatively slow moving waters in gentler channels usually found in the plains and deposited over the bed and when the waters spill over the banks during flooding above the bed. These river valley plains have a fertile alluvial soil cover which supports a variety of crops like wheat, rice, sugarcane and jute, and hence, supports a large population.

           Question 3(iii).
           <br/>
           If you move from Badrinath to Sunderbans delta along the coarse of the river Ganga, what major geomorphological features will you come across?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           If we move from Badrinath to Sunderbans delta along the course of the river Ganga, following major geomorphological features will we come across:
          </p>
          <p>
           1. V Shaped Valleys: Valleys start as small and narrow rills; the rills will gradually develop into long and wide gullies; the gullies will further deepen, widen and lengthen to give rise to valleys. Depending upon dimensions and shape, many types of valleys like V-shaped valley, gorge, canyon, etc. can be recognised.
          </p>
          <p>
           2. Gorge: A gorge is a deep valley with very steep to straight sides.
          </p>
          <p>
           3. Canyon: A canyon is characterised by steep step-like side slopes and may be as deep as a gorge. A gorge is almost equal in width at its top as well as at its bottom. In contrast, a canyon is wider at its top than at its bottom. In fact, a canyon is a variant of gorge.
          </p>
          <p>
           4. Waterfall: When the rivers start falling in pits in mountainous regions, it makes waterfall.
          </p>
          <p>
           5. Plunge pools: Once a small and shallow depression forms, pebbles and boulders get collected in those depressions and get rotated by flowing water and consequently the depressions grow in dimensions. A series of such depressions eventually join and the stream valley gets deepened. At the foot of waterfalls also, large potholes, quite deep and wide, form because of the sheer impact of water and rotation ofboulders. Such large and deep holes at the base of waterfalls are called plunge pools.

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Explain the characteristics or features of Northern plains?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Northern Plains-
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            These plains extend approximately 3,200 from the east to the west.
           </li>
           <li>
            The average width of these plains varies between 150-300 km.
           </li>
           <li>
            The maximum depth of alluvium deposits varies between 1,000-2,000 m.
           </li>
           <li>
            The area covered by northern plains is 7 lakhs square km and is most densely populated region of country.
            <br/>
            From north to South, these plains can be divided into three sub divisions: Bhabar, Tarai and Alluvial Plains. The alluvial plains can be further divided into the Khadar and the Bhangar.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Bhabar
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            It is a narrow belt ranging between 8-16 km parallel to the Shiwalik foothills at the breaking of the slopes.
           </li>
           <li>
            The streams and rivers coming from the mountain deposit heavy materials of rocks and boulders and at times, disappear in this zone.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Tarai
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Its approximate width is of 20-30 km where most of the streams and river re-emerge without having any properly demarcated channel, thereby, creating marshy and swampy condition known as the Tarai.
           </li>
           <li>
            It has a luxurious growth of natural vegetation and houses a varied wild life.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Alluvial Plains
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            These plains have characteristic features of mature stage of fluvial erosional and depositional landforms such as sand bars, meanders, ox- bow lakes and braided channels. The Brahmaputra plains are known for their riverine islands and sand bars.
           </li>
           <li>
            The mouths of these mighty rivers also form some of the largest deltas of the world, for example, the famous Sunderbans delta.
           </li>
           <li>
            These river valley plains have a fertile alluvial soil cover which supports a variety of crops like wheat, rice, sugarcane and jute, and hence supports a large population.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Explain the physical features of coastal plains.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           On the basis of the location and active geomorphological processes, it can be broadly divided into two:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The western coastal plains;
           </li>
           <li>
            The eastern coastal plains.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           The western coastal plains are an example of submerged coastal plain. It is a narrow belt and provides natural conditions for the development of ports and harbours. Kandla, Mazagaon, JLN port. Navha Sheva, Marmagao, Mangalore, Cochin, etc. are some of the important natural ports located along the west coast.
          </p>
          <p>
           Extending from the Gujarat coast in the north to the Kerala coast in the south, the western coast may be divided into following divisions – the Kachchh and Kathiawar coast in Gujarat, Konkan coast in Maharashtra, Goan coast and Malabar coast in Karnataka and Kerala respectively. As compared to the western coastal plain, the eastern coastal plain is broader and is an example of an emergent coast.
          </p>
          <p>
           There are well- developed deltas here, formed by the rivers flowing eastward in to the Bay of Bengal. These include the deltas of the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Kaveri. Because of its emergent nature, it has less number of ports and harbours. The continental shelf extends up to 500 km into the sea, which makes it difficult for the development of good ports and harbours.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is believed that the city of Dwaraka which was once a part of the Indian mainland situated along the west coast is submerged under water. Because of this submergence it is a narrow belt and provides natural conditions for the development of ports and harbours. Kandla, Mazagaon, JLN port Navha Sheva, Marmagao, Mangalore, Cochin, etc. are some of the important natural ports located along the west coast.
          </p>

           </li>
           <li>
            Brahmaputra flows through deep a gorge after crossing Namcha Barwa.
           </li>
           <li>
            Subansiri, Dihang, Dibang and Lohit are the important rivers. Perennial rivers have high rate of fall which helps to generate hydro-electricity.

           Class 11 Geography Chapter 2 Value Based Questions
          </h4>
          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           What is the relevance of northern plains for our country?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Northern plains are very relevant for our country because:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            It is made up of alluvial deposits brought by rivers due to which it is very fertile.
           </li>
           <li>
            It is plain therefore; it is easier to develop means of transport and communication in this region.
           </li>
           <li>
            It is suitable for human habitation.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           All physical divisions of India have their own importance. Which value does it reflect? How do we need to incorporate this value in our life style?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           It is very much clear that all landforms are important in their own ways. Mountains provide scenic beauty, biodiversity, flora and fauna; plains provide aerable land, living conditions for human habitation; plateau provides minerals and coastal plains sea products. It teaches us the value of respect for all. This value is very important to maintain peace and harmony in the society. The world could not be place of human survival without diversity. Therefore, each one of us need to learn to respect people who are not alike. Each human being is unique like landforms but has its own relevance.
