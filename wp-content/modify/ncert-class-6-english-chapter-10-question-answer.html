           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Do you think Prabhat wished to play another match with Surya? Why do you think so?
           <br/>
           Answer:

           No, As Prabhat almost lost the game which he won through cheating.
          </p>
          <p>
           <span style="color: #0000ff;">
            Let us discuss (Page 107)
           </span>
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           How did Surya feel about playing?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Surya felt that one should play with joy and fun. He enjoyed playing the game. His happy smile never left his face.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           What was it about Surya that Prabhat observed?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Prabhat observed that Surya did not feel bad about losing the game as he did. In the next match, Prabhat observed that Surya never felt bad even though he hadn’t scored a basket for ten minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
           <span style="color: #0000ff;">
            Let us think and reflect (Page 108)
           </span>
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the lines given below and answer the questions.
           <br/>
           (a) If Prabhat sensed that he would lose a game, he would not play it. He would take part only when he was sure of winning, even if the game lasted only for a minute. You could not stop him from playing the kind of games he was good at, like badminton.
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) Complete the sentence suitably.
           <br/>
           Prabhat would play a game only if ____________________.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           good at the game
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Which game was Prabhat good at playing?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           sure to win
          </p>
          <p>
           (iii) Select the most suitable option to complete the sentence.
           <br/>
           This behavior of Prabhat tells us that he was ________________.
           <br/>
           (a) good at the game
           <br/>
           (b) sure to win
           <br/>
           (c) afraid of losing
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (c) afraid of losing
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Surprisingly, Prabhat could not sleep well that night. He had won the game but he did not feel as happy as he usually did. What was surprising was that Surya did not feel bad about losing. What was more surprising was that Prabhat saw Surya playing basketball the next day.
          </p>
          <p>
           (i) Select the one option that tells us about the way Prabhat was feeling that night.
           <br/>
           (a) hurt
           <br/>
           (b) unhappy
           <br/>
           (c) afraid
           <br/>
           (d) focused
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (b) unhappy
          </p>
          <p>
           (ii) Why does Prabhat find Surya’s behavior ‘surprising’?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Prabhat finds Suiya’s behavior ‘surprising’ because Suiya is just the opposite in behavior. For Instance, Suiya was joyful even after losing the game.
          </p>

           (iii) Fill in the blank by choosing the most suitable option given in the bracket.
           <br/>
           We can say that Surya’s reaction to not winning was ____________________ (similar to/as serious as/different from) Prabhat’s.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           We can say that Surya’s reaction to not winning was
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            <strong>
             Different from
            </strong>

           Prabhat’s.
          </p>
          <p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Answer the following questions.
           <br/>
           (a) How did Prabhat’s attitude towards winning and losing affect his enjoyment of games in the beginning?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Prabhat’s attitude towards winning and losing affected his enjoyment of games in the beginning because he could not think about losing even if it was a very simple game like marbles.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) Why do you think Prabhat cheated in the beginning to win the badminton match against Surya?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Prabhat did so because he could not accept defeat, hence he cheated to win the badminton match against Surya. Also if he had lost the game, he would have felt unhappy.
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) How did Surya’s attitude differ from Prabhat’s?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Surya’s attitude differed from Prabhat’s because he used to enjoy every moment of the game while playing. He will not bother whether he will win or not. He was a very charming personality.
          </p>
          <p>
           (d) Do you think Prabhat’s approach to games was healthy? Why or why not?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Prabhat’s approach to games was not healthy, because winning and losing are a part of life.
          </p>
          <p>
           (e) Why do you think sporting spirit is important?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Sportsman spirit is important as you should enjoy the game while playing and also concentrate on winning. Hence, a few times you might lose the game, if the opponent is strong. In such cases, you should not be jealous and work hard to win next time. You should always shake hands after the game to congratulate the winner.
          </p>
          <p>
           (f) Explain how the title of the story, ‘Change of Heart’, is suitable.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           “Change of Heart” is a fitting title for this story because Prabhat changes his way of thinking. At first, he only cares about winning, but later he learns to enjoy playing games, no matter if he wins or loses. This change in Prabhat’s attitude is what the title “Change of Heart” means. It’s like he had a change of mind, and now he sees things differently.

           Change of Heart
           <br/>
           Good morning, everyone. I know you all are excited about the Friday, friendly matches. This Friday we shall have three matches—one for chess, the next for kho-kho and finally one for badminton. I have put up the kho-kho teams’ name list on the sports notice board. Since this is a team game, your class VI-B shall be playing against the VI-D kho-kho team. The kho-kho match refreshments are being sponsored by Xydium Sports Club. Let me clarify, the spelling is X-Y-D-I-U-M, Xydium.
           <br/>
           Now the place for the matches—the first one is chess. It’ll take place in the 1st-floor activity room with Vani as the scorekeeper. Kho-kho will be played on the sport’s ground where I will be the referee. For badminton, we have chosen the multipurpose hall on the ground floor hall. The net will be put up there.
           <br/>
           For the chess match, it has been decided that this match shall be played between Sarita and Nupur. Two matches will be played during the regular games period on Friday but khokho will be played in the 2nd and 3rd periods. Remember the kho-kho team names are up on the Sports’ Notice Board.
           <br/>
           Good luck!
