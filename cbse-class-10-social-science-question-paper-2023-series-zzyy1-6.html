          How did the ‘Treaty of Constantinople’ of 1832 recognize Greece as an independent nation? Explain. [2]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Greece had been part of the Ottoman Empire since the 15th century. The growth of revolutionary nationalism in Europe sparked off a struggle for independence amongst the Greeks which began in 1821 . Nationalists in Greece got support from other Greeks living in exile and from West Europeans who had sympathies for ancient Greek culture. Pcets and Artists lauded Greece as the cradle of European civilisation and mobilised public opinion to support its struggle against a Muslim (Ottoman) empire. The English poet Lord Byron organised funds. Finally, the treaty of Constantinople of 1832 recognised Greece – as an independent nation.

          <br/>
          Following are the effects of print culture on French Revolution:
          <br/>
          (i) Print popularised the ideas of enlightened thinkers like Voltaire and Rousseau, and those who read these books, started questioning everything and developed critical and rational thinking. These thinkers attacked the sacred authority of the Church and despotic power of the State.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) All existing values, norms and institutions, which were never questioned earlier, were revalued through debates and discussions by the public in print.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) By 1780s, there was an outpour of literature that mocked royalty and criticised their morality. The existing social order was criticised. Through cartoons and caricatures, they made people aware that while common people were going through tremendous hardships, the monarchy remained absorbed in merry-making and did not care about sufferings of common peopleThis ultimately led to the growth of a hostile feeling against the monarchy.

          Or, (B) Explain the importance of Transportation in the economic development of the country. [3]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (A) We call Tourism as a trade because:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           With increase in the number of foreign tourists visiting India, we earned foreign exchange worth 30 billion dollars in 2019 which is further increasing year by year making tourism an important trade.
          </li>
<li>
           Over 17 million foreign tourists visit India every year for appreciating our heritage, our culture, for medical purposes or for business purposes, etc.
          </li>
<li>
           Over 15 million people are directly engaged in the tourism industry.
          </li>
<li>
           Tourism promotes national integration, provides support to local handicrafts and cultural pursuits.
          </li>
<li>
           Tourism also helps in the development of international understanding about our culture and heritage.
          </li>
<li>
           Rajasthan, Goa, Jammu &amp; Kashmir and temple towns of south India are the most popular tourist destinations. These states earn huge sums of money from tourism trade.

          Question 27.
          <br/>
          Distinguish between formal and informal sources of credit. [3]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Following are the differences between Formal and Informal sources of credit:
          <br/>
          (i) Banks and Cooperative Societies fall under the formal sector. One can obtain loans from banks or cooperative societies. In the informal sector, money can be borrowed from a person, friend, relative, money-lenders, traders, employers, etc.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) The Reserve Bank of India supervises the functioning of formal sources of loans, On the other hand, there is no organisation that checks or supervises the activities of lenders in the informal sector.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) Bank loans require documentation and collateral (collateral is an asset such as land, building, vehicles, livestock, deposits with the bank, etc.). This is used as a guarantee to the lender until the loan is paid back, whereas the loans from informal sources do not require any such collateral.
         </p>
<p>
          (iv) Compared to formal lenders most of the informal lenders charge a much higher, rate of interest on loans. Poor people are unable to obtain loans from formal sector because they do not have assets that can be used as collateral.

          Question 28.
          <br/>
          “In modern democracies, power sharing arrangements can take many forms.” Explain the statement. [3]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Forms of Power-Sharing:
          <br/>
          (i) Power is shared among different organs of government, such as the legislature, executive and judiciary. This is horizontal distribution of power because it allows different organs of government, placed at the same level to exercise different powers. A system of checks and balances ensures that in such a distribution none of the organs can exercise unlimited powers. Example: In India the judiciary has an independent status. The Supreme Court is the apex court of justice. The Parliament is the legislative body where the laws governing the country are made and the Executive is the implementing body.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Power can be shared among governments at different levels – a general government for the entire country and governments at provincial or regional level. This is the federal form of government. The Constitution clearly lays down the powers of different levels of government. This federal division of power involving higher and lower levels of government is also called the vertical division of power.
          <br/>
          Example: A key change in the Constitution of Belgium in 1993 was that the regional governments were given constitutional powers that were no longer dependent on the Central Government. Thus, Belgium shifted from a unitary to a federal form of government.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) Power may also be shared among different social groups, such as religious and linguistic groups.
          <br/>
          Example: ‘Community government’ in Belgium is a good example of this arrangement. The government is elected by people belonging to one language community – Dutch, French and German speaking, no matter where they live.
         </p>
<p>
          (iv) Power-sharing arrangement can also be seen in the way political parties, pressure groups and movements control or influence those in power. In contemporary democracies, this takes the form of competition among different parties who form alliances to contest elections.
          <br/>
          Example: In India, there were three major alliances in 2004 parliamentary elections- the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) and the Left Front.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 29.
          <br/>
          Why is the issue of sustainability important for development? Explain with examples. [3]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) Development of a country needs to be continuous. Every country would like to have the level of development go up further.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Mary scientists have warned that the present levels of development cannot be sustained for the future as the present rate of consumption of both renewable and non-renewable resources is very high. Rapid industralisation has led to environmental degredation.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) Sustainable development aims at development without damaging the environment and at the same time conserving for the future.
         </p>
<p>
          (iv) Sustainability of development is essential not only for the present generation but also for future generations to ensure a good life. For example, if all renewable and non-renewable resources are not conserved for future, then it will be a threat to economic and social development in the future.

          Or, (B) “The economic strength of a country is measured by the development of manufacturing industries.” Explain with examples. [5]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (A) Ways through which the Industrial pollution of fresh water can be reduced:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Minimising the use of water for processing by reusing and recycling it in two or more successive stages.
          </li>
<li>
           Harvesting of rain-water to meet water requirements of industries and other domestic purposes.
          </li>
<li>
           Treating hot water and effluents before releasing them in rivers and ponds in the following ways:
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          – Primary treatment by mechanical means such as screening, grinding, flocculation and sedimentation.
          <br/>
          – Secondary treatment by biological process.
          <br/>
          – Tertiary treatment by biological, chemical and physical processes. This involves recycling of waste water.
          <br/>
          Or, (B) Production of goods in large quantities after processing from raw materials to more valuable products is called manufacturing.
          <br/>
          Manufacturing belongs to the secondary sector in which the primary materials are processed and converted into finished goods. The economic strength of a country is measured by the development of manufacturing industries.
          <br/>
          Importance of manufacturing industries for India:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           It helps in modernising agriculture, which is the base of our economy.
          </li>
<li>
           It reduces heavy dependence on agricultural income by providing jobs in nonagricultural sectors.
          </li>
<li>
           Industrial development is necessary for eradication of poverty and unemployment because people get jobs and generate more income.
          </li>
<li>
           Export of manufactured goods expands trade and brings in much needed foreign exchange.
          </li>
<li>
           Industries bring riches faster to a nation because manufacturing changes raw materials into finished goods of a higher value, so industrial development brings prosperity to the country.

          Question 32.
          <br/>
          Why is Democratic Government considered as Legitimate Government? Explain. [5]
          <br/>
          Or, (B) How is Democracy a better form of government in comparison to dictatorship? Explain. [5]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (A) Democratic government is a legitimate government. It may be slow, less efficient, not always very responsive or clean. But a democratic government is peoples’ own government. That is why there is an overwhelming support for the idea of democracy all over the world. People wish to be ruled by representatives elected by them. As democratic government is peoples’ own government, they believe that democracy is suitable for their country. Democracy’s ability to generate its own support is itself an outcome that cannot be ignored.
          <br/>
          Or, (B) Democratic governments are better than non-democracies (dictatorship) because:

          Question 33.
          <br/>
          “Liberalisation of foreign trade and foreign investment policy have shown far reaching changes in India.” Support the statement with suitable arguments. [5]
          <br/>
          Or, (B) ‘Among producers and workers, the impact of globalization has not been uniform.’ Support the statement with suitable arguments. [5]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (A) Removing barriers or restrictions set by the government is what is known as liberalisation.
          <br/>
          (i) Liberalisation of trade and investment policies allows Indian producers to compete with producers around the globe leading to an improvement in performance and quality of products.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) After the barriers on foreign trade and foreign investment were removed to a large extent, goods could be imported and exported easily and also foreign companies could set up factories and offices in India. This has led to an increase in trade between different countries.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) Businesses are allowed to make decisions freely about what they wish to import or export due to the liberal policies of the government.
         </p>
<p>
          (iv) Doors of investment opened up for MNCs. They have been investing large sums of money in India and have been seeking to earn large profits.
          <br/>
          Thus, liberalisation gives impetus to the process of rapid integration and inter-connection between countries, i.e., globalisation.
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          (B) Globalisation has not has a uniform impact among producers and workers because:
         </p>
<p>
          (i) Globalisation has posed a major challenge for a large number of small producers and workers. Small manufacturers have been hit hard due to competition causing many industrial units to shut down, rendering many workers jobless in small industries. (The small industries in India employ 20 million workers.)
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Due to the pressure of competition, most employers do not employ workers on a permanent basis; to avoid paying for the whole year.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) Workers’ jobs are not secure any more, wages are low and they are forced to work overtime to earn adequate money.
         </p>
<p>
          (iv) In order to cut costs of products for the benefit of MNCs, employers in industries such as garment exports, pay very low wages to workers. Hence, there is a need for ‘fair globalisation’ which will ensure that the benefits of globalisation are shared better in a more equitable manner.

          <br/>
          INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT
          <br/>
          By the first decade of the twentieth century a series of changes affected the pattern of industrialization in India. As the swadeshi movement gathered momentum, nationalists mobilised people to boycott foreign cloth. Industrial groups organised themselves to protect their collective interests, pressurising the government to increase tariff protection and grant other concessions. From 1906, moreover, the export of Indian yam to China declined since produce from Chinese and Japanese mills flooded the Chinese market. So industrialists in India began shifting from yarn to cloth production. Cotton piece goods production in India doubled between 1900 and 1912.
          <br/>
          Yet, till the First World War, industrial growth was slow. The war created a dramatically new situation. With British mills busy with war production to meet the needs of the army, Manchester imports into India declined. Suddenly, Indian mills had a vast home market to supply. As the war prolonged, Indian factories were called upon to supply war needs: jute bags, cloth for army uniforms, tents and leather boots, horse and mule saddles and a host of other items. New factories were set up and old ones ran multiple shifts. Many new workers were employed and everyone was made to work longer hours. Over the war years industrial production boomed.
          <br/>
          (34.1) What was the Swadeshi Movement? [1]
          <br/>
          (34.2) Why did the Cotton piece goods production in India double between 1900 to 1912? [1]
          <br/>
          (34.3) Explain any two events that helped India to regain its market. [2]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          34.1 The Swadeshi Movement advocated the boycott of foreign goods and British Institutions. It also advocated Mass mobilization which saw many people come together to raise awareness and demand Swaraj.
         </p>
<p>
          34.2 From 1906, the export of Indian Yarn to China declined. So industrialists in India began shifting from yarn to cloth production. Thus, cotton piece goods production in India doubled between 1900 and 1912.
         </p>
<p>
          34.3 Events that helped India to region its market:
          <br/>
          (i) During the First World War, British Mills were busy with war production to meet the needs of the army. As a result, Manchester imports into India declined and Indian mills had a vast home market to supply.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) As the war prolonged, Indian factories were called up to supply war needs like jute bags, cloth for army uniforms, tents, leather boots, horse and mule Saddles and a host of other items. Thus, industrial production boomed.

          <br/>
          COMMUNITY AND CONSERVATION
          <br/>
          Conservation strategies are not new in our country. We often ignore that in India, forests are also home to some of the traditional communities. In some areas of India, local communities are struggling to conserve these habitats along with government officials, recognising that only this will secure their own long-term livelihood. In Sariska Tiger Reserve, Rajasthan, villagers have fought against mining by, citing the Wildlife Protection Act. In many areas, villagers themselves are protecting habitats and explicitly rejecting government involvement. The inhabitants of five villages in the Alwar district of Rajasthan have declared 1,200 hectares of forest as the Bhairodev Dakav ‘Sonchuri’, declaring their own set 6f rules and regulations which do not allow hunting, and are protecting the wildlife against any outside encroachments.

          35.1 In India forests are home to some of the traditional communities. Local communities conserved these habitats to secure their own long-term livelihood.
         </p>
<p>
          35.2 Under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act 1972, an All India list of protected species was published. The aim was to protect the remaining population of certain endangered species by: (a) banning hunting (b) giving legal protection to their habitats and (c) restricting trade in wildlife.

          DECENTRALISATION IN INDIA
          <br/>
          This new system of local government is the largest experiment in democracy conducted anywhere in the world. There are now about 36 lakh elected representatives in the panchayats and municipalities etc., all over the country. This number is bigger than the population of many countries in the world. Constitutional status for local government has helped to deepen democracy in our country. It has also increased women’s representation and voice in our democracy. At the same time, there are many difficulties. While elections are held regularly of Panchayats and people participate enthusiastically in it but meetings of gram sabhas are not held regularly.

          Question 28.
          <br/>
          Why is power sharing desirable in democracy? Explain. [3]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) A democratic rule involves sharing power with those affected by its exercise and who have
          <br/>
          to live with the effects. Power sharing ensures that people have the right to be consulted and have equal participation in the government.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) In a democracy, each individual has a say in governance through their elected representatives. This is the essence of power sharing that grants equal rights to each citizen.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) Sharing of power ensures that respect for diversity and desire for living together becomes a shared ideal amongst different communities in a country. It actually makes the country united and the administration easier.
         </p>

          Question 32.
          <br/>
          (A) How does democracy promote Political and Social values? Explain. [5]
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          (B) ‘Democracy is best suited to produce its own outcomes.’ Explain. [5]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (A) Democracy promotes political and social values by:
          <br/>
          (i) Dignity of women. Democracy recognises dignity of women as a necessary ingredient of society. The one way to ensure that women related problems get adequate attention is to have more women as elected representatives. To achieve this, it is legally binding to have a fair proportion of women in the elected bodies. Panchayati Raj in India has reserved one-third seats in local government bodies for women. In March 2010, the Women’s Reservation Bill was passed in the Rajya Sabha ensuring 33% reservation for women in Parliament and State legislative bodies.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Democracy has strengthened the claims of disadvantaged and discriminated castes. When governments are formed, political parties usually take care that representatives of different castes and tribes find a place in it. Some political parties are known to favour some castes. Democracy provides for equal status and opportunities for all castes.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) Democracy transforms people from the status of a subject into that of a citizen. A democracy is concerned with ensuring that people will have the right to choose their rulers and people will have control over the rulers. Whenever possible and necessary, citizens should be able to participate in decision-making that affects them all.
         </p>
<p>
          (iv) A citizen has the right and the means to examine the process of decision-making. There is transparency in a democracy like India. In October 2005, the Right to Information (RTI) law was passed which ensures all its citizens the right to get all the
          <br/>
          information about the functioning of the government departments. In a democracy, people also have the right to complain about its functioning.
         </p>
<p>
          (v) A democratic government is legitimate and this makes ordinary citizens value their democratic rights and take a position that democracy can address all social, economic and political problems. Critical evaluation of the policies of the government by the electronic media and newspapers also results in a healthier and vibrant democracy.
          <br/>
          Or, (B) There are certain things that democracy must provide:
         </p>
<p>
          (i) In a democracy people have the right to choose their rulers and people will have control over them. Whenever possible and necessary, citizens should be able to participate in decision-making, that affects them all.
          <br/>
          Thus the most basic outcome of democracy is that it produces a government that is accountable to the citizens and is responsive to their needs and expectations.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) It is right to expect democracy to produce a government that follows procedures and is accountable to people. To do so, the democratic government develops mechanisms for citizens—regular, free and fair elections, open public debate on major policies and legislations, and citizens’ right to information about the government and its functioning. Thus, people wish to be ruled by the representatives elected by them. Therefore, democracy’s ability to generate its own support is in itself an outcome that cannot be ignored.

          Question 33.
          <br/>
          (A) The Government can play a major role in making a fair Globalisation. Examine the statement. [5]
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          (B) Analyse the impact of Globalisation in India. [5]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (A) The government can play a major role in making fair globalisation possible. Fair globalisation would create opportunities for all and also ensure that the benefits of globalisation are shared better. Government policies must protect the interests not only of the rich and the powerful, but also of all the people in the country.
          <br/>
          (i) Government should ensure that labour laws are implemented and workers’ rights are protected.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Government should support small producers to improve their performance till the time they become strong enough to compete with foreign competition.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) If necessary, government should put trade and investment barriers.
         </p>
<p>
          (iv) It can negotiate with WTO for fairer rules.
         </p>
<p>
          (v) It can also align with other developing countries with similar interests to fight against the domination of developed countries in the WTO.
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          (B) Globalisation has had both a positive as well as a negative effect:
          <br/>
          1. People with education, skill and wealth have benefitted by globalisation.
          <br/>
          (i) Greater competition among producers (both local and foreign) has been advantageous to consumers, particularly the well-off section. Rich people enjoy improved quality and lower prices for several products and enjoy a higher standard of living.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) MNCs have increased their investments in India over the past 20 years in industries such as cell phones, automobiles, electronics, soft drinks, fast food and services such as banking.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) New jobs have been created in all these industries and services.
         </p>
<p>
          (iv) Top Indian companies have benefitted from the increased competition. They have invested in newer technology and production methods.
         </p>
<p>
          (v) Some Indian companies have gained from successful collaborations with foreign companies. Globalisation has enabled some companies to emerge as multinationals.
         </p>
<p>
          2. However, globalisation has not been uniform among producers and workers.
          <br/>
          (i) Globalisation has posed a major challenge for a large number of small producers and workers. Small manufacturers have been hit hard due to competition causing many industrial units to shut down, rendering many workers jobless in small industries. (The small industries in India employ 20 million workers.)
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Due to the pressure of competition, most employers do not employ workers on a permanent basis; to avoid paying for the whole year.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) Workers’ jobs are not secure any more, wages are low and they are forced to work overtime to earn adequate money.
         </p>
<p>
          (iv) In order to cut costs of products for the benefit of MNCs, employers in industries Such as garment exports, pay very low wages to workers. Hence, there is a need for ‘fair globalisation’ which will ensure that the benefits of globalisation are shared better in a more equitable manner.

          (A) ‘Globalisation is a multi-dimensional concept.’ Examine the statement. [5]
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          (B) Examine the steps taken by the developing countries to attract foreign investment. [5]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (A) Globalisation refers to the integration of an economy with the other countries based on interdependence. It is a multidimensional concept having political, economic and cultural manifestations. It is the process of exchange of ideas, capital, commodities and people. Globalisation is a multi-dimensional phenomenon whereby goods, capital, people, knowledge, ideas and culture readily flow across the boundaries. The worldwide ‘interconnectedness’ that is created and sustained is a consequence of these constant flows For example
          <br/>
          (i) Movement of capital from one place to another.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) People moving in search of better livelihoods to different parts of the World.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) Commodities being traded across borders.
          <br/>
          Or, (B) The developing countries have taken the following steps to attract foreign investment:
         </p>
<p>
          (i) Setting up of special economic zones. SEZs or Special Economic Zones are industrial zones being set up by the Central and State Governments in different parts of the country. SEZs are to have world class facilities such as electricity, water, roads, transport, storage, recreational and educational facilities. Companies which set up
          <br/>
          production units in SEZs are exempted from taxes for an initial period of five years. SEZs thus help to attract foreign companies to invest in India.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Flexibility in labour laws. Companies in the organized sector have to obey certain rules that aim to protect the workers’ rights. In the recent years, the government has allowed companies to ignore many of these. Instead of hiring workers on a regular basis, companies hire workers flexibly for short periods when there is intense pressure of work. This is done to reduce the cost of labour for the company.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) Providing legal concessions. The government provides various legal concessions to ‘ . attract companies to invest in India.
         </p>
<p>
          (iv) Curbing trade barriers. By removing trade barriers a friendly and positive business atmosphere is created so that foreign investors can invest in developing countries.
         </p>
<p>
          (v) Granting Compulsory Licensing. To attract foreign investment, the developing countries have also started granting few licences to foreign companies so as to make it easy for them to conduct business in any developing country.
