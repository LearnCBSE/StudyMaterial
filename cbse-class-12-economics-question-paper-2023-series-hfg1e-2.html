          Question 12.

          (a) “Under the flexible exchange rate system, the Central Bank does not intervene in the foreign exchange market”. [3]
          <br/>
          Justify the statement, giving valid arguments.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          In a system of Flexible Exchange Rates (also known as Floating Exchange), the exchange rate is determined freely by the market forces of demand and supply. There is no intervention by the Central Bank. lienee, there are no official reserve transactions. In this exchange rate, the foreign exchange market like other competitive markets, leads to an equilibrium exchange rate at which quantity demanded equals quantity supplied of foreign exchange.

<p>
          (b) Explain the impact of home currency depreciation on the exports of a nation. [3]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          When the value of domestic currency depreciates, it results in increased exports and decreased imports. This is so because in such a case, with given amount of foreign currency, more goods can be bought in the domestic market.
          <br/>
          For example, one American dollar will now get more goods in the domestic market. Thus it is clear that when depreciation of domestic currency of a country takes place its exports increase.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 13.
          <br/>
          “The process of credit creation by commercial banks comes to an end when the total of required reserves become equal to the initial deposits.”
          <br/>
          With the help of a numerical example, prove that the given statement is true. [4]
          <br/>
          Answer:
         </p>
<p>
          The power of commercial banks which enables them to expand their deposits through loans is called credit creation. Through this process, commercial banks are able to create credit, which is in far excess of their cash reserves.
         </p>
<p>
          This process is based on the following assumptions:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           There is a single banking system in the economy.
          </li>
<li>
           All transactions are routed through banks.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          Numerical Example:
          <br/>
          Suppose, a customer deposits ₹10,000 in bank and the Legal Reserve Ratio (LRR) is 20%. Bank has to pay interest on these deposits. Therefore, it further lends this money to people after retaining a part of this amount to meet its customers obligations. Since LRR is 20%, the bank will keep 20% of deposits as reserve i.e., ₹2,000 and will lend the remaining 80% i.e., ₹8,000. Those who borrow will Spend this money and these ₹8,000 will come back to the bank in the form of deposits. Bank again keeps 20% of ₹8,000 i.e., ₹1,600 as reserves and lends ₹6,400 to those who need it. In this way, deposit will go on increasing @80% of the last deposit.
          <br/>
          This deposit creation comes to an end when the total reserves become equal to the initial deposit i.e., ₹10000 in this case.
          <br/>

<br/>
          Thus, the total deposit creation is 5 times the initial deposit.

          Question 14.
          <br/>
          (a) “In an economy ex-ante Aggregate Demand is more than ex-ante Aggregate Supply.”
          <br/>
          Explain its impact on the level of output, income and employment. [4]
          <br/>
          Answer:
         </p>
<p>
          If aggregate demand (AD) is greater than the aggregate supply (AS) at the full employment level of income, it is a situation of excess demand. Excess demand gives rise to an inflationary gap, which causes a rise in the price level, called demand-pull inflation. When AD is greater than AS at the full employment level of income, the gap between the two is called inflationary gap.
          <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Class 12 Economics Question Paper 2023 (Series HFG1E2) with Solutions 10" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-169635" height="164" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CBSE-Class-12-Economics-Question-Paper-2023-Series-HFG1E2-with-Solutions-10.png" width="258"/>
<br/>
          The situation of excess demand and inflationary gap becomes clear by looking at the given diagram. OQ is the full employment level of income. To establish full employment equilibrium, Aggregate Demand (AD) should be QF. However, actual AD is QG which is greater than QF. The resulting inflationary gap, created due to excess demand is represented by FG.
         </p>
<p>
          This situation of excess demand does not affect the level of output or employment because economy is already at full employment level. However, it will lead to rise in prices because demand is increasing but there can be no further corresponding increase in supply.

          Question 16.
          <br/>
          (a) (i) “Many goods and services which may contribute to welfare, but are not included in estimating Gross Domestic Product (GDP).”
          <br/>
          Do you agree with the given statement? Give valid reason in support of your answer. [3]
          <br/>
          (ii) With suitable examples, distinguish between final goods and intermediate goods. [3]
          <br/>
          Answer:
         </p>
<p>
          (i) Yes, I agree with the statement.
          <br/>
          GDP does not take into account those transactions that are not expressed in monetary terms. This is a major limitation of GDP as an index of welfare of a country as there are many transactions which although are non-monetary but add to the growth and development of the nation. Many non-monetary activities in the economy done out of love and affection are not evaluated in monetary terms due to lack of authentic data. Thus, Non-market transactions like Services of housewives, Services of social workers etc., which increase economic welfare are not included in the measurement of GDP. Therefore, GDP underestimates welfare and may not reflect the well-being of the country.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Difference between Intermediate goods and Final goods

          Or
         </p>
<p>
          (b) (i) Using a suitable numerical example, distinguish between Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP). [4]
          <br/>
          (ii) State the meaning of ‘normal resident’ of a country.
          <br/>
          Answer:
         </p>
<p>
          (i) The aggregate market value of the economic output produced in a year within the boundaries of the country is known as Nominal GDP. It is expressed in current year prices and is considered as GDP without the effect of inflation.
          <br/>
          Real GDP, on the other hand, refers to the value of economic output produced in a given period adjusted according to the changes in the general price level. It is inflation adjusted GDP and is expressed in base year prices or constant prices.
          <br/>
          Real GDP is always considered as a better indicator of economic growth.
         </p>
<p>
          For example, an economy produces only one commodity say rice and it produced 20 kg of rice in year 2018 (base year). Suppose price of rice is ₹20/kg in 2018. So GDP of 2018 is ₹400 (i.e., 20 kg x ₹20). Thus nominal as well as Real GDP of 2018 at current and constant prices is the same in 2018. Now, due to inflation the price of rice goes upto ₹25 kg in 2019 and the economy produces same amount of rice, i.e., 20 kg. Now, Nominal GDP has increased from ₹400 to ₹500 in 2019 but since the economy is producing the same amount of rice, i.e., 20 kg, it does not reflect growth.
          <br/>
          In order to ascertain growth, real GDP of 2019 needs to be estimated. For this value of race produced in 2019 at base year price, i.e., price of rice in 2018 should be calculated.
          <br/>
          Production of rice in 2019 = 20 kg
          <br/>
          Price of rice in base year, i.e., 2018 = ₹20/kg
          <br/>
          Hence there is no growth.
          <br/>
          Now, suppose rice production in 2019 increases to 30 kg, then
          <br/>
          Nominal GDP = ₹25 x 30 = ₹750
          <br/>
          and Real GDP = 30 × ₹20 = 600
         </p>
<p>
          Growth Rate = \(\frac{600-400}{400}\) × 100 = \(\frac{200}{400}\) × 100 = 50%
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Normal residents of a country. A resident, whether a person or an institution, is one whose centre of economic interest lies in the domestic territory of the country in which he lives.
          <br/>
          Centre of economic interest implies:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           The resident lives or is located within the economic territory.
          </li>
<li>
           The resident carries out the basic economic activities of earning, spending and accumulation from that location.
          </li>
</ul>

          Question 17.
          <br/>
          Read the following text carefully. Answer the given questions on the basis of the same and common understanding:
          <br/>
          On 30th September 2022, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised Repo Rate for the fourth time in a row. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the policy rate by 50 basis points [1 basis point = \(\frac{1}{100}\)
          <sup>
           th
          </sup>
          a percent]. After this announcement, the new Repo rate stands at 5.9%, while the Reverse repo rate continues to stand at 3.35%.
         </p>
<p>
          Commercial banks borrow money from the Central Bank, when there is a shortage of funds. With the surge in the Repo rate, borrowings by general public will become costlier. This is because, as RBI hikes its Repo rate, it becomes costly for the banks to borrow short term funds from the Central Bank. As a result, the banks hike the rate at which customers borrow money from them to compensate for the hike in the Repo rate. This happens because banks offer loans to retail consumers at an interest rate which is generally, directly proportional to the Repo rate.
         </p>
<p>
          The increase of 0.50 percent in Repo rate will lead to higher interest rates on loans for borrowers, implying that the Equated Monthly Instalments (EMIs) for repaying the existing loans will also increase.

          <br/>
          (a) Define ‘Repo Rate’. [1]
          <br/>
          (b) Outline the recent change made by the Monetary Policy Committee of Reserve Bank of India in the Repo rate. [1]
          <br/>
          (c) “Increase in Repo rate is an important tool used by Monetary Policy Committee to combat the situation of inflation in the Economy.” Justify the given statement. [4]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Repo Rate. It may be defined as the rate at which the Central Bank lends money to the commercial banks in the event of any shortfall of funds in the short-run.
         </p>
<p>
          (b) The Monetary Policy Committee decided to raise the policy rate by 50 basis points
          <br/>
          (1 basis point = \(\frac{1}{100^th}\) of a %).
          <br/>
          The new Repo rate is now 5.9%.
         </p>
<p>
          (c) Repo rate is the rate of interest charged by Central Bank on loans given to commercial banks. During a situation of excess demand leading to inflation, the Central Bank raises the Repo rate which discourages commercial banks in borrowing from the Central Bank. Increase in Repo rate forces commercial banks to increase their own lending rates making credit costlier. As a result, the demand for loans falls discouraging investment. Also reduction in availability of credit helps in correcting the situation of excess demand and reducing inflationary gap.

<img alt="CBSE Class 12 Economics Question Paper 2023 (Series HFG1E2) with Solutions 4" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-169629" height="125" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CBSE-Class-12-Economics-Question-Paper-2023-Series-HFG1E2-with-Solutions-4.png" width="206"/>
<br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Degradation of environment has serious consequences. It leads to loss of natural capital as well as human capital. Increase in greenhouse gases since the industrial revolution has led to the serious problem of global warming. In view of these serious effects, measures need to be taken to tackle this problem on priority basis.
          <br/>
          The following strategies can be adopted to achieve sustainable development
          <br/>
          (i) Use of non conventional sources of energy. India heavily depends upon thermal and hydro power plants to meet its power needs. Both of these pollute the environment extensively. Wind and solar energy, of which India has a vast potential, can be effectively tapped to replace thermal and hydro power. These sources can provide electricity without any adverse impact on environment.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Use of gases. Rural households in India generally use wood, dung cakes and other biomass as fuel. This practice has led to several problems like deforestation, reduction in green cover and air pollution. To meet this situation, subsidised LPG is being provided by the government. Besides it, Gobar gas plants are being encouraged through easy loans and subsidies. In cities, the use of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) as fuel in public transport system has substantially reduced the level of air pollution.

<p>
          Question 29.
          <br/>
          (a) “Recently the Government of India has taken numerous steps towards increasing the farmer’s income through agricultural diversification.”
          <br/>
          In light of the above statement, explain any two advantages of diversification in agriculture. [3]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Agricultural diversification refers to the reallocation of some of farm’s productive resources into new activities or crops to reduce market risk. It has two aspects:
          <br/>
          1. One relates to change in cropping pattern i.e., diversification and crop production.
          <br/>
          2. The other relates to a shift of workforce from agriculture to other allied activities (livestock, poultry, fisheries etc.) and nonagricultural sector.
          <br/>
          Agricultural diversification is considered necessary for sustainable livelihood because of the following reasons:
         </p>
<p>
          1. The need for diversification arises from the fact that there is greater risk in depending exclusively on farming for livelihood.
         </p>
<p>
          2. Diversification towards new areas is necessary not only to reduce the risk from agriculture sector but also to provide productive sustainable livelihood options to rural people.
         </p>
<p>
          3. Much of the agricultural employment activities are concentrated in the kharif season. But during the rabi season, in areas where there are inadequate irrigation facilities, it becomes difficult to find gainful employment. Therefore, expansion into other sectors is essential to provide supplementary gainful employment and in realising higher levels of income for rural people to overcome poverty.
         </p>
<p>
          4. To ease the pressure of population on land, there is an urgent need to shift the workforce from agriculture to allied activities and non-agriculture sectors.
         </p>
<p>
          5. Crop diversification ensures higher growth and higher income levels for rural people.
         </p>
<p>
          6. Diversification helps in stabilising farm income during the phase of fluctuations in production levels and market prices.
         </p>
<p>
          7. It also helps in meeting the growing demand for products like fruits, fish, eggs, milk and milk products etc.
         </p>
<p>
          Or
         </p>
<p>
          (b) “Active Government intervention is essential in education and health sectors in India.”
          <br/>
          Do you agree with the given statement? Give reasons in support of your answer. [3]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Yes, I agree with the given statement.
          <br/>
          The expenditure on education and health assumes great importance in the formation of human capital.
          <br/>
          To ensure favourable benefits, government intervention is important because of the following reasons:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           Expenditure on education and health have a long term impact on human resource and it cannot be reversed.
          </li>
<li>
           Individual consumers of the services do not have complete information about the quality of services and their costs.
          </li>
<li>
           In the absence of above information, the private sector providers of education and health services can acquire monopoly power and exploit people.
          </li>
<li>
           These sectors need huge investment with a very high fixed expenditure which private investors would not be willing to make unless they are allowed to recover their cost by charging a high price for these services.
          </li>
</ol>
<p>
          The role of government becomes important to ensure that the private providers of the services adhere to the standards stipulated by the government and charge the correct price so that these services remain accessible to the general population.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 30.
          <br/>
          Discuss any two merits and demerits of the Green Revolution in the agricultural sector in the Indian economy. [4]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The New Agricultural Strategy or Green Revolution refers to the large increase in production of foodgrains due to use of High Yielding Variety (HYV) seeds in the mid sixties.
          <br/>
          Following are the benefits of Green Revolution:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           Increase in marketed surplus. A good proportion of the rice and wheat produced during the Green Revolution period (available and marketed surplus) was sold by the farmers in the market. As a result, income of the farmers increased.
          </li>
<li>
           Decrease in price of food-grains. The price of food-grains declined relative to other items of consumption. The low income groups, who spend a large percentage of their income on food, benefited from this decline in relative prices.
          </li>
<li>
           Buffer stock. The spread of Green Revolution technology enabled the government to procure sufficient amount of food-grains to build buffer stock which could be used in times of food shortage.
          </li>
<li>
           Self-reliance. Indian agricultural productivity increased sufficiently to enable the country to be self-sufficient in food-grains. (any two)
          </li>
</ol>
<p>
          However, Green Revolution in India suffers from serious limitations which were as follows:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           Limited crops. Green revolution was confined largely to wheat and rice crops. There has been no similar rise in the production of pulses and commercial crops like jute, cotton, etc.
          </li>
<li>
           Confined to limited area. Green Revolution was restricted only to few states like Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.
          </li>
<li>
           Economic divide. The new agricultural technology relied heavily upon the use of costly inputs
           <br/>
           like fertilizers, HYV seeds and intensive irrigation. Though these inputs were subsidised by the government, the poor farmers were still unable to use them. Consequently, only the rich farmers benefited from the HYV technology. (any two)
          </li>
</ol>
<p>

          Question 32.
          <br/>
          (a) “Expenditure on On-the-job training is an important means of human capital formation in an economy.”
          <br/>
          Give valid reasons to justify the given statement. [4]
          <br/>
          Answer:
         </p>
<p>
          (a) The productivity of physical capital is substantially enhanced with the improvement in human capital. Due to this reason, many firms provide On-the-job training to the workers. Such training can be provided fast and without much cost.
          <br/>
          It increases the skill and efficiency of the workers and leads to an increase in production and productivity.
          <br/>
          On-the-job training may take different forms:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Workers may be trained in the firm itself under the supervision of a skilled worker.
          </li>
<li>
           They may be sent for Off-Campus training.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          Usually, after On-the-job training of employees, firms insist that the workers should work for a specified period of time so that the firm can recover the benefits of the enhanced productivity owing to the training provided by it. On-the-job training is considered as a source of human capital formation as the return of expenditure on such training, in the form of enhanced labour productivity, is more than its cost.
         </p>
<p>
          Or
         </p>
<p>
          (b) “Organic Farming is the need of the hour to promote sustainable development but, has its own limitations.”
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Organic farming is a system of farming that will rely upon the use of organic inputs for cultivation which largely include animal manures and composts. It has done away with the use of chemical inputs like chemical fertilizers, insecticides and pesticides.
          <br/>
          Organic farming is beneficial because of the following reasons:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           Cheaper system of cultivation. Organic farming offers a means to substitute costlier agricultural inputs such as HYV seeds, chemical fertilizers, pesticides etc. with locally produced organic inputs which are cheaper.
          </li>
<li>
           Labour intensive. Since organic farming requires more labour and less of capital, it is better suited for Indian conditions.
          </li>
<li>
           Sustainable agriculture. The path of conventional agriculture is unsustainable. Organic farming is a natural way of farming which is environment friendly and maintains long term fertility of the soil and is, thus, sustainable.
          </li>
<li>
           Increase in farmer’s income. Demand for organic food is on the rise in domestic and international markets. Hence, organic farming has resulted in increase in farmer’s income and inflow of foreign exchange due to rise in exports.
          </li>
<li>
           Provides healthy food. Organically grown food is considered healthy as it has more nutritional value than food grown through chemical farming.
          </li>
</ol>
<p>
          However, organic farming suffers from the following limitations:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           Less popular. Organic farming has to be popularised among the farmers by creating awareness so that they can willingly adopt the new technology.
          </li>
<li>
           Lack of infrastructure and marketing facilities. Inadequate infrastructure and the problem of marketing the products are major concerns which need to be addressed to promote organic farming.
          </li>
<li>
           Shorter food life. Organic produce has a shorter shelf-life as compared to food produced through chemical farming.
          </li>
<li>
           Low yield. Yields from organic farming are less as compared to modern agricultural farming in the initial years which is why small and marginal farmers are reluctant to adopt it.
          </li>
<li>
           Limited choice of crops. The choice in production of off-season crops is quite limited in organic farming.
          </li>
</ol>
<p>
          Question 33.
          <br/>
          Elaborate any two advantages and limitations each of organic farming in the light of the above Statement. [4]
          <br/>
          (a) (i) Define Worker Population Ratio. Discuss its usefulness. [3]
          <br/>
          (ii) ‘Mr. Rishi, after completing his education, has joined his family business but his marginal productivity is zero.
          <br/>
          Comment upon the employment status of Mr. Rishi. Give valid reasons in support of your answer. [3]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) Worker Population Ratio is defined as the proportion of population that is actively contributing to the production of goods and services of a country.
          <br/>
          Worker Population Ratio = \(\frac{\text { Total number of workers }}{\text { Total Population }} \times 100\)
          <br/>
          This is an indicator which is used for analysing the employment situation in the country. A higher ratio indicates that more people are actively engaged in the productive activities of the economy. Whereas a medium or low ratio means that a very high proportion of its population is not involved directly in economic activities.

<br/>
          (ii) This is a case of Disguised Unemployment.
          <br/>
          Disguised unemployment. Disguised or hidden unemployment is associated with the work area where surplus manpower is employed out of which some individuals have zero or almost zero marginal productivity. It implies that if such people are removed from the employment, the level of total output remains the same. Thus it is a kind of unemployment where some people seem to be employed but are actually not. It is very commonly found in the agricultural sector operating in the rural areas of the country. For example, when 8 members of a farmer’s family are employed on a small farm plot where 4 members are enough. Thus those extra 4 members are actually unemployed rather than being employed.

          Or
          <br/>
          (b) (i) ‘Kavya works on her family farm and is neither paid in cash nor in the form of grains.
          <br/>
          Can she be categorised as a worker? Give valid reasons in support of your answer. [3]
          <br/>
          (ii) “In the late 1990’s India experienced a widening gap between the growth of GDP and employment generation.” Discuss. [3]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) A worker is an individual who is involved in some economic activity to earn a living.
          <br/>
          In this case, Kavya, though not getting paid for the work that she is doing, is contributing to the flow of goods and services by rendering her productive services. Since she is working on her family farm. Therefore, she may be called as self-employed.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) This is a situation of Jobless growth.
          <br/>
          Jobless growth. It is also known as jobless recovery is an economic phenomenon in which a macroeconomy experiences growth while maintaining or decreasing its level of employment. In simple words, jobless growth means that while the economy is growing at a decent rate but it is generating very few job opportunities. Due to this many qualified personnel remain unemployed. India despite being one of the fastest growing economies still faces job crunch. Though the economy is on the rise but it is not able to create the required number of job opportunities. Thus jobless growth is a situation when there is an overall acceleration on the growth rate of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the economy in the absence of corresponding expansion in employment opportunities.

          Question 34.
          <br/>
          Read the following text carefully and answer the given questions on the basis of the same and common understanding:

          The stabilisation and structural adjustment measures, initiated under the 1991 “Economic Reforms”mark a watershed moment in India’s economic policies. For almost three decades since independence, India’s development strategy and economic policies were guided by the objectives of accelerating the growth of output and employment with social justice and equity.
          <br/>
          Ever since the 1970’s, it was realised that many of the regulations on economic activities have outlived their usefulness and were in fact hampering economic growth and development. In response to this, the government initiated some milder liberalisation reforms for almost a decade since the early 1980’s.
          <br/>
          However, the Indian economy soon had to face the Gulf crisis and consequently:
          <br/>
          (i) The uncertainties about the oil prices;
          <br/>
          (ii) The external payment problems;
          <br/>
          (iii) The serious inflationary pressures;
          <br/>
          (iv) The scarcities of essential commodities;
          <br/>
          (v) The deterioration of fiscal discipline, etc.
          <br/>
          These led to the Indian economy on the verge of Economic crisis.
          <br/>
          In response to this emerging crisis, the Government initiated a set of stabilisation and structural reforms like:
          <br/>
          (i) Reduction in fiscal deficit;
          <br/>
          (ii) Containment of growth in money supply;
          <br/>
          (iii) An exchange rate adjustment system etc.
          <br/>
          The key objective of stabilisation policy was to bring the growth of aggregate demand in line with long term growth path of the economy.
          <br/>
          In conjunction, the structural adjustment measures like;
          <br/>
          (i) industrial delicensing;
          <br/>
          (ii) liberalisation of policy regime governing international trade;
          <br/>
          (iii) deregulation of financial sector;
          <br/>
          were taken to improve the supply side of the economy. This shifted the long-term growth path of the economy itself completely.

          <br/>
          (b) Government introduced a set of stabilisation and structural reforms to solve the economic crisis. State the key initiative and objectives of these policies adopted by the Government of India. [4]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Reasons for the initiation of economic reforms in 1991:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           The uncertainties about the oil prices;
          </li>
<li>
           The external payment problems;
          </li>
<li>
           The serious inflationary pressures;
          </li>
<li>
           The scarcities of essential commodities;
          </li>
<li>
           The deterioration of fiscal discipline, etc.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          (b) The stabilization and structural adjustment measures that the government initiated under the 1991 economic reforms had the key objective of bringing the growth of aggregate demand in line with long-term growth path of the economy. The government wanted to make the
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           economy more competitive
          </li>
<li>
           accelerate the growth rate

<li>
           improve fiscal discipline and
          </li>
<li>
           make the production units more efficient and highly competitive.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          The stabilisation measure aimed at maintaining sufficient foreign exchange reserves and to correct the balance of payments position along with bringing inflation under control. Whereas the structural adjustments measures included measures like:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           industrial delicensing
          </li>
<li>

          Question 13.
          <br/>
          (a) “In an economy ex-ante Aggregate”Demand is less than ex-ante Aggregate Supply.”
          <br/>
          Explain its impact on the level of output, income and employment. [4]
          <br/>
          Answer:
         </p>
<p>
          (a) If equilibrium is established before the full employment level of output, it is a situation where aggregate demand is less than aggregate supply. The gap between the two is deflationary gap as shown by EF in the adjacent diagram.
          <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Class 12 Economics Question Paper 2023 (Series HFG1E2) with Solutions 15" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-169643" height="187" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CBSE-Class-12-Economics-Question-Paper-2023-Series-HFG1E2-with-Solutions-15.png" width="218"/>
<br/>
          This gap can be rectified by increasing the level of aggregate demand. In this case autonomous investment needs to be increased.

<p>
          Question 17.
          <br/>
          On 30th September 2022, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised Repo Rate for the fourth time in a row. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the policy rate by 50 basis points [1 basis point = \(\frac{1}{100}\)
          <sup>
           th
          </sup>
          a percent]. After this announcement, the new Repo rate stands at 5.9%, while the Reverse repo rate continues to stand at 3.35%.
         </p>
<p>
          Commercial banks borrow money from the Central Bank, when there is a shortage of funds. With the surge in the Repo rate, borrowings by general public will become costlier. This is because, as RBI hikes its Repo rate, it becomes costly for the banks to borrow short term funds from the Central Bank. As a result, the banks hike the rate at which customers borrow money from them to compensate for the hike in the Repo rate. This happens because banks offer loans to retail consumers at an interest rate which is generally, directly proportional to the Repo rate.
         </p>
<p>
          The increase of 0.50 percent in Repo rate will lead to higher interest rates on loans for borrowers, implying that the Equated Monthly Instalments (EMIs) for repaying the existing loans will also increase.

         </p>
<p>
          (a) State the meaning of Repo rate and reverse repo rate. [4]
          <br/>
          (b) In order to bring down the rate of inflation outline and discuss the step taken by the Monetary Policy Committee of Reserve Bank of India.
          <br/>
          Answer:
         </p>
<p>
          (a) Repo Rate. It may be defined as the rate at which the Central bank lends money to the commercial banks in the event of any shortfall of funds in the short-run.
         </p>
<p>
          Reverse Repo Rate. It is the rate at which the Central bank of a country borrows money from the commercial banks.
          <br/>
          Increase in repo rate encourages commercial banks to deposit funds with the Central bank reducing availability of funds with it. This, thus helps in curtailing money supply in the economy and vice-versa.
         </p>
<p>
          (b) Steps taken in order to bring down the Rate of Inflation. During a situation of excess demand leading to inflation, the Central Bank raises the repo rate which discourages Commercial Banks in borrowing from the Central Bank.
          <br/>
          Increase in repo rate forces Commercial Banks to increase their own lending rates making credit costlier. As a result, the demand for loans falls discouraging investment.
         </p>
<p>
          Also reduction in availability of credit helps in correcting the situation of excess demand and reducing inflationary gap.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 28.
          <br/>
          “In order to protect the future of our planet, it is important to tackle carbon emission.”
          <br/>
          In the light of the above statement and image discuss any two strategies to tackle this global concern. [3]

<br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Degradation of environment has serious consequences. It leads to loss of natural capital as well as human capital. Increase in greenhouse gases since the industrial revolution has led to the serious problem of global warming. In view of these serious effects, measures need to be taken to tackle this problem on priority basis.
          <br/>
          The following strategies can be adopted to achieve sustainable development
          <br/>
          (i) Use of non conventional sources of energy. India heavily depends upon thermal and hydro power plants to meet its power needs. Both of these pollute the environment extensively. Wind and solar energy, of which India has a vast potential, can be effectively tapped to replace thermal and hydro power. These sources can provide electricity without any adverse impact on environment.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Use of gases. Rural households in India generally use wood, dung cakes and other biomass as fuel. This practice has led to several problems like deforestation, reduction in green cover and air pollution. To meet this situation, subsidised LPG is being provided by the government. Besides it, Gobar gas plants are being encouraged through easy loans and subsidies. In cities, the use of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) as fuel in public transport system has substantially reduced the level of air pollution.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 30.
          <br/>
          “The debate over farm subsidies in India is enraged at different platforms.” [4]
          <br/>
          Discuss any two arguments in favour of continuing farm subsidies.
          <br/>
          Answer:
         </p>
<p>
          An agricultural subsidy is a government subsidy paid to farmers to supplement their income, manage the supply and availability of agricultural commodities and inputs and also influence the cost and supply of such commodities and inputs.
          <br/>
          1. The subsidies given in the form of reduced prices of inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, power for irrigation, credit at lower interest rates etc. help the farmers to reduce their cost of production.
         </p>
<p>
          2. Another from of subsidy is fixing of minimum procurrent price of the farmer’s produce. By fixing these minimum prices, Government makes it sure that the farmers must get their cost plus some profit.
          <br/>
          These subsidies are given so that 55% of our population, dependent on agriculture can also live atleast a normal life and there are no more suicides in the agriculture dominated Indian economy.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 34.
          <br/>
          Read the following text carefully and answer the given questions on the basis of the same and common understanding:

          </li>
<li>
           Decrease in the role of public sector. The only industries which are reserved for the public sector are defence equipments, atomic energy generation and railway transport.
          </li>
<li>
           De-reservation of production by small scale industries.
          </li>

          (a.) “In an economy Planned spending is more than planned output” Explain its impact on the level of output, income and employment. [4]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Planned spending refers to people planning to purchase final goods and services during the year. Planned output means the production units planning to produce final goods and services during the year. An economy is in equilibrium when planned expenditure or spendings is equal to planned output, i.e.,
          <br/>
          AD = AS or C + I = Y
          <br/>
          Consumption Expenditure + Investment Expenditure = Income
          <br/>
          Equilibrium condition implies that whatever is produced by firms is either consumed by households or invested by the firms. There is neither surplus nor shortage in the economy. But if in an economy, planned spending is greater than planned output, i.e., AD &gt; AS, the producers find the stock falling below the desired level then this means that consumer and firms together would be buying more goods than firms were producing. This would lead to an unplanned decrease in inventories. Firms would then expand production and increase employment. As a result, output and income would increase. This process of increase in income will continue until the economy is in equilibrium where AD = AS.
         </p>
<p>
          Or
         </p>
<p>
          (b) For a hypothetical economy, assuming there is an increase in the Marginal Propensity to Consume from 80% to 90% and change in investment to be ?2,000 crore.
          <br/>
          Using the concept of investment multiplier, calculate the increase in income due to change in Marginal Propensity to Consume. [4]
