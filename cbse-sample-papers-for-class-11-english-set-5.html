           1. Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow: (10)
          </span>
</p>
<p>
          1. There are times when everyone has to face grief. When someone dear to oneself dies, one is left in a state in which shock and grief overcome the ordinary life. One is left in a situation when one feels there is nothing one can do. Grief and mourning are not always associated with only death. It also happens with other types of losses. It could be the loss of one’s job, loss of one’s house or the loss of a close friend or a partner.
         </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
          2. The best people who are able to cope with these are those, who come from cultures that have strict, formal and intensive mourning rituals. In India, we have diverse rituals which nowadays are being discarded. But these help in the crisis. The near and dear ones come to share the grief and apply balm with their words of solace. In mourning, it is an essential part of coming to terms with loss.
         </p>
<p>
          There comes a time when one has to give up one’s grief and rejoin the mainstream of life. Mourning in itself passes through these phases. Firstly, it is in the nature of shock and disbelief. A feeling of numbness over takes. The brain is not in a position to accept, it so happens that one expects the arrival of a loss thinking that nothing will change and he will be with the lost one. In second phase, one realises the truth that the loss has actually happened, and was not a dream. It is now that one feels the pain. Now one recollects the old moments and the memory of guilt creeps in.
         </p>

</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
          3. Here, the affected person displays odd behaviour and has difficulty in eating and is unable to sleep. One may remain in this stage for weeks, months and sometimes for years. In the next phase, reflection from pain and negative feelings creep in. This leads to the positive side.
         </p>
<p>
          Now one feels one must make alternative arrangements or replacements. Here, one is ready to cope with the situation. One knows that one cannot recover what he or she has lost but is conscious of the future accepting the loss and is ready for the alternative.
         </p>
<p>
          4. On passing through all the stages of grief, it seems that time has passed like a river under the bridge. This shows that mourning has been successful. One cannot forget the loss but comes to terms with reality.
         </p>

          It is surprising that the population of bears is increasing in spite of the dangerous changes in the global climate. Many attribute it to the captive breeding programmes conducted in many countries. On the other hand, it is sad to notice that dolphins have almost become extinct.
         </p>
<p>
          Much of it is due to the extensive water pollution especially in areas that are their natural habitats. Unlike whales, who are able to change their habitat and venture into deeper parts of the oceans, dolphins are unable to adapt to changing habitats at short notices. No wonder, the whale population has seen many ups and downs over the last few years.

<span style="color: #0000ff;">
           3. Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow:
          </span>
</p>
<p>
          1. When Lal Bahadur Shastri took over charge as the Prime Minister of the most populous democracy in the world in June, 1964, he started with many initial disadvantages. The most obvious one was that he had stepped into the shoes of a colossus like Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, who, in spite of the fact that his policies were not always popular, commanded the spontaneous affection of the masses of India and was also a front-ranking world statesman.
         </p>
<p>
          Another handicap from which Mr. Shastri suffered was that even though he had been active in the political life of the country for nearly four decades, he had never visited any foreign country and was, therefore, not a well-known figure in important world capitals.
         </p>
<p>
          In addition, he succeeded to the Prime Minister ship of the country at a time when it was plagued by many serious problems, the foremost among which were rising prices and food shortage. Fissiparous tendencies were in evidence not only in the ranks of the ruling party (accentuated after the passing away of Pt. Nehru) but also in several parts of the country like Nagaland, Punjab and Kashmir.
         </p>
<p>
          Memories of the humiliation suffered by India at the hands of Chinese were still fresh in the popular mind and the nation was passing through a crisis of confidence. It appeared that the people’s faith in the country’s future had been badly shaken.
         </p>
<p>
<img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 11 English Set 5 with Solutions" height="16" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Learn-CBSE.png" width="116"/>
</p>
<p>
          Because of the military and political reverses it had suffered, India’s international prestige had gone very low and its relations with its neighbours were not of the best. This was the India which Mr. Shastri inherited from his illustrious predecessor and he was in many aspects the exact opposite of the latter.
         </p>
<p>
          A simple Indian rustic had been asked to step into the shoes of a world citizen. A modest, self-effacing man who had hitherto been content to operate from the wings had been pushed on to the centre of the stage to replace a glamorous popular hero who had the aura of long-established leadership about him.
         </p>
<p>
          The problems he was expected to grapple with were enough to break the back of the most tenacious and determined man but Mr. Shastri weathered the storm with his abundant rugged commonsense and almost impartible calmness.

          (b) Summary
          <br/>
          Lai Bahadur Shastri took charge as the Prime Minister of India after Pandit Jawahar Lai Nehru in 1964. It was not a very easy situation. He had stepped into the shoes of a colossus and popular leader like Pt. Jawahar Lai Nehru. He was not a well known figure in world capitals nor he had visited any foreign countries.
         </p>
<p>
          The Indian situation was also not good. It was plagued with many serious problems like food shortage, rising prices, low prestige in international arena, etc. The nation was passing through a crisis of confidence. People’s faith in the country’s future had been broken.
         </p>
<p>
          It was a difficult situation to be faced by Lal Bahadur Shastri but people expected that he would be able to grapple with ail the problems. Lai Bahadur Shastri weathered the storm with his commonsense and calmness and came out successfully to overcome these problems.

</p>
<p>
          (a) Do not eat too much. You will be ill.
          <br/>
          (b) He will be late. That is certain.
          <br/>
          (c) He was quite tired. He could scarcely stand.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Do not eat too much lest you should be ill.
          <br/>
          Explanation: In this sentence, “lest” is used as a conjunction meaning “for fear that” or “in case.” It introduces the consequence or outcome that the speaker wants to avoid, which is becoming ill due to eating too much
         </p>
<p>
          (b) That he will be late is certain.
          <br/>
          Explanation: In this sentence, we have a noun clause “That he will be late” serving as the subject of the sentence. The main verb “is” connects the subject to the predicate adjective “certain,” which describes the certainty of the statement.
         </p>
<p>
          (c) He was so tired that he could scarcely stand.
          <br/>
          Explanation: In this sentence, the phrase “so tired” introduces the level of tiredness, indicating a high degree of exhaustion. The conjunction “that” is used to introduce the result or consequence of the extreme tiredness, which is “he could scarcely stand.” The sentence shows a cause-and-effect relationship, emphasizing the severity of his tiredness, leading to his difficulty in standing.

          Question 8.
          <br/>
          There was a time when children could be seen playing outdoor games like Hide and Seek, Football, etc. But now-a-days they are very much pre-occupied with chatting on mobiles, surfing the internet and watching TV Outdoor games are very necessary as they keep one physically fit. Write a speech to be delivered in the morning assembly on ‘Games are very necessary for holistic growth’ in about 120—150 words. (5)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Games are Very Necessary for Holistic Growth
          <br/>
          Good morning respected Principal, teachers and my dear friends. Today, I, Arpita Mittal of class Xi-B, stand before you to present my views on ‘Games are very necessary for holistic growth.’ Holistic growth focuses on the fullest development of the student, encouraging students to become the very best or finest that they can be and enabling them to experience all they can from life and reach their goals.
         </p>
<p>
          Physical activity is vital to the holistic development of young people, fostering their like Hide and Seek, Football, Cricket, etc. But now children rather love to stay indoors stuck with their internet, TV and mobiles which do not keep them physically fit.
         </p>

</p>
<p>
          Outdoor games or activities is a vital avenue for young people to learn and develop life skills. Physical, education and sports have strong influence on inclusion and community building, character-building, delinquency, etc. So I would strongly suggest that games are very necessary for holistic growth and for an overall development.

          You have to deliver a speech in the Morning Assembly on the topic ‘The increasing rate of crime in today’s society’. Write the speech in about 120—150 words.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The increasing rate of crime in today’s society
          <br/>
          Respected Principal, honourable teachers and my dear friends. Today, I, Shivam Bhardwaj of Class XI, stand in front of you to share my views on the increase in crime rate and the measures we should take to curb it. Friends, human society is gradually but surely being criminalised.
         </p>
<p>
          Everyday the newspaper reports ghastly murders, sensational robberies, rapes, thefts and kidnapping. Naturally, the graph of crimes in today’s society is sharply on the rise. Living has become quite risky, unpleasant and unsafe. Women and old people are the worst sufferers. Our cities have become the dens of smugglers and criminals. The capital of India, New Delhi has earned a rare notoriety in this respect. It is not only political capital but also the crime capital of India.
         </p>
<p>
          Growing unemployment and lack of motivation among the educated young men have drawn many of them to the world of crimes. Thefts and way-laying are no more the monopoly of illiterate ruffians. Graduates in jeans are now the active members of the crime world. The new wave of consumerism has added only fuel to the fire. Craze for foreign goods, cars, bikes, dresses and cosmetics has fuelled their ambitions. They need fast money to fulfill their never dying desires.
         </p>
<p>
          There are no shortcuts to reduce the growing crime rate in society. Of course, it is the duty of the police to maintain law and order in public. Efficient and impartial functioning of the police can help in curbing the crime rate in society. But the health of society depends on many other factors. The army of unemployed young men is swelling. Naked materialism and consumerism have overpowered their minds and morals. Moral education in schools can be quite helpful in bringing down the crime rate effectively.
          <br/>
          Thank you.

          Question 9.

          The Government has banned the use of animals in the laboratories for the purpose of dissection. Write a debate in about 120—150 words either for or against this decision. (5)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The Government has banned the dissection of animals in laboratories
          <br/>
          Good morning everyone, I am Navtej and I am going to speak in favour of the motion ‘Animal testing should be banned’.
         </p>
<p>
          In our laboratories, animals are dissected, despite the fact that their dissection is cruel and unpleasant. It is absolutely unethical. At the same time, it teaches children to abuse animals. On one hand, organisations like PETA are fighting for the protection from cruelty on these speechless beings, and on the other hand, they are being killed mercilessly in the name of experiments. It is not only cruel but also unwise to use them for this purpose.
         </p>
<p>
          Before reaching the laboratories, the animals are stockpiled on the top of one another. Then they are shipped in crowded containers without any regulation of temperature. No food or water is provided to them. Then they die in such condition due to starvation.
         </p>
<p>
          In such a situation, it is not difficult to imagine that these piled animals create negative impact on biodiversity. They’ll definitely spread disease. Can you think the drugs that pass tests, alone, will be safe? Definitely not: Moreover, killing them disturbs ecological balance. Therefore, it is wise to replace animal dissection by the use of virtual labs and models.
          <br/>
          Thank you.

          The policy of ‘No detention till class VIII’ is not in the interest of students. Write a debate in 120-150 words either in favour or against the motion.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The Policy of ‘No detention till class VIII’ is not in the interest of Students
          <br/>
          Honourable Chairperson, respected judges and my dear friends. Today, I am standing before you to express my arguments against the viewpoint that the policy of no detention till class VIII is not in the interest of students. Perhaps, the main culprits behind all this propaganda are the ones who want to cash in on this idea by making the students to go for more and more tuition classes.
         </p>
<p>
          The fact is that education is not a thing that should be bound up in the trap of examination, where students are made to sit for exams all the time in order to get the tag of ‘Pass’ or ‘Fail’. As one of my friends presented his point that such a policy of no detention is making students careless, I’d like to tell my dear friend that it is better to be careless rather than to adopt unfair means to pass the exams – as we read about such incidents in the newspapers every day.
         </p>
<p>
<img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 11 English Set 5 with Solutions" height="16" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Learn-CBSE.png" width="116"/>
</p>
<p>
          The tension of exams is making students mentally sick. I am afraid that the period/time that should be used in gaining pure knowledge without any pressure of detention may be lost in the tension about failing exams. There is also another advantage of this ‘no detention policy’ that more and more students without any such fear of failure will attend the school with full enthusiasm and will make themselves ready automatically for the period of maturity. There they will benefit from their feelings of confidence and eagerness to go ahead, without any tension of passing or failing that will lead them towards a healthy and bright future.
          <br/>
          Thank you.

          Read the following extract and answer the questions that follow: (1×3 = 3)
          <br/>
          A. And forever, by day and night, I give back life to my own origin, and make pure and beautify it;
         </p>
<p>
          Question 1.
          <br/>
          Who ‘give back life’ in the poem?
          <br/>
          (A) Earth
          <br/>
          (B) Living Organisms
          <br/>
          (C) Poet
          <br/>
          (D) Rain
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Option (D) is correct.
          <br/>
          Explanation: The poem is about the cycle of life and death, and how the rain is constantly giving back life to the Earth.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 2.
          <br/>
          What is the origin of ‘I’ in the poem?
          <br/>
          (A) Pond
          <br/>
          (B) Rivers
          <br/>
          (C) Oceans
          <br/>
          (D) All of the above
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Option (D) is correct.
          <br/>
          Explanation: The origin of the “I” in the poem is the water. The water is found in ponds, rivers, and oceans. It is the source of all life on Earth. The water evaporates from the Earth, rises into the atmosphere, cools and condenses, and then falls back to the Earth as rain. The rain then nourishes the plants and animals, which then die and return their nutrients to the Earth. This cycle of life and death is what keeps the Earth alive.
         </p>
<p>

          <br/>
          ‘It is referred to the earth.
          <br/>
          Explanation: The Earth is being purified and beautified by the rain. The rain washes away the dirt and pollutants from the Earth, and it also helps to oxygenate the soil. This makes the Earth cleaner and more beautiful.

</p>
<p>
          Question 1.
          <br/>
          How do adults behave according to the poet?
          <br/>
          (A) Adults around him practice what they preached.
          <br/>
          (B) Adults around him did not practice what they preached.
          <br/>
          (C) Adults around him were totally indifferent.
          <br/>
          (D) Adults around him are not understandable.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Option (B) is correct.
          <br/>
          Explanation: Because they often say one thing and do another. For example, the poet says that adults “talk about love but they don’t know how to show it.” This shows that adults can be dishonest and misleading.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 2.
          <br/>
          The poet found adults
          <br/>
          (A) Unpredictable
          <br/>
          (B) Vulnerable

         </p>
<p>
          She got him ready for school. She accompanied him to his school and came back home with him. She was a very religious lady. She was always telling the beads of her rosary. She had compassion even for animals and birds. She fed the village dogs. She took to feeding the sparrows in the city. But the grandmother was a conservative lady. She didn’t like the English language and Science. She hated music. She associated music with prostitutes and beggars.

          Question 16.
          <br/>
          Answer any one of the following questions in about 120-150 words: (6×1=6)
          <br/>
          Compare and contrast uncle Khosrove and cousin Mourad.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Uncle Khosrove and cousin Mourad have one very important point in common-their craziness. Mourad was considered the natural descendant of uncle Khosrove in this respect. They both are dominating in nature. Both use pet words and phrases and roar aloud to quieten the hearer.
         </p>
<p>
          While uncle Khosrove says, “It is no harm, pay no attention to it.” Mourad boasts, “I have a way with birds/dogs/farmers.” Khosrove shouts at his son Aram, the barber and farmer John Byro. The narrator is a patient listener to Mourad’s assertions. They are different in their age and physical build up.
         </p>
<p>
          Uncle Khosrove, a middle-aged person, is an enormous man with a powerful head of black hair and very large moustache. Mourad is an athletic young chap of thirteen. Khosrove is irritable impatient and furious in temper. Mourad is reasonable in conversation.

          Describe the narrator’s second visit to Mrs. Dorling’s house.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The narrator’s first visit to Mrs. Dorling’s house was in vain. She decided to try for a second time. This time a girl of about fifteen opened the door to her. Her mother was not at home. The narrator said that she would wait for her. Following the girl along the passage, the narrator saw their old fashioned iron candle-holder hanging next to a mirror. The girl made her sit in the living room and went inside.
         </p>
<p>
          The narrator was horrified to find herself in a room she knew and did not know. She found herself in the midst of familiar things which she longed to see again but which oppressed her in the strange atmosphere. She dared not look around her.

</p>
<p>
          The woollen table cloth, the cups, the white tea-pot, the spoons, the pewter plate, everything was full of memories of her former life. Suddenly the objects linked with her former life lost their value in strange surroundings. They too appeared strange to her. She no longer had desire to possess them. She got up, walked to the door and came out of the house.
