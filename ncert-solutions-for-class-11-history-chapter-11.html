          Question 1.
          <br/>
          What were the major developments before the Meiji restoration that made it possible for Japan to modernise rapidly?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The following developments helped in the modernization of Japan before the Meiji restoration:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Peasants were not allowed to carry arms, only Samurai could carry swords now.
          </li>
<li>
           Growth of population led to the growth of commercial economy.
          </li>
<li>
           Efforts were made to develop silk industry.
          </li>
<li>
           People developed reading habits.
          </li>
<li>
           The export of precious metals restricted.
          </li>
<li>
           Theater and arts were patronized in towns.
          </li>
<li>

          Question 2.
          <br/>
          Discuss how daily life was transformed as Japan developed?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Earlier in Japan, the patriarchal household system prevailed. In it, many generations lived together under the control of the head of the family. New ideas of the family spread. People became more affluent. Homu, the new home was a nuclear family where husband and wife lived together. The new concept of domesticity generated demands for new types of domestic goods and new forms of farming.

          Question 3.
          <br/>
          How did the Qing dynasty try and meet the challenge posed by the Western powers?

          Answer:
          <br/>
          The Qing dynasty could not meet the challenges posed by the Western powers. They utterly failed. The Qing dynasty also demanded change in the country. But they also failed in this endeavour.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          It is true that Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China were successful in liberating China and laying basis for its current success. In 1925, after the death of Sun Yat-sen, the Guomindang was headed by Chiang-Kai- shek. Previously, the Communist Party of China was founded in 1921. He tried his best to strengthen the rule of the Guomindang. But no initiatives were taken to achieve the three revolutionary principles of Sun Yat-sen, i.e. nationalism, democracy and socialism. He also made an attempt to raise a new class of landlords. They always exploited the peasantry. Mao Zedong, a Communist leader formed the Red Army. It was formed to strengthen the Peasant Movement. He became its chairperson in 1930. He also started a guerilla war against Chiang-Kai-shek’s army. He defeated Chiang’s army four times. But for the fifth time, he left the idea of war and started the Long March.
         </p>
<p>
          Mao Zedong formed a Communist front against Japan in 1935. It was his opinion that his struggle against Japan would make his mass movement more effective. He suggested that a United Front be formed in collaboration with Red Army. But Chiang completely denied his proposal and he was imprisoned by his own soldiers. The increasing power of Mao Zedong worried Chiang-Kai-shek. He was not interested in working with him. Even then he came with Mao in the war against Japan. After the end of war, Mao put the proposal of coalition govt before Chiang but he declined. Mao continued his struggle and was elected the chairman of the Chinese govt.
         </p>
<p>
          Chiang Kai-shek was worried about increasing power of Mao Zedong. After many persuasions he became ready to stand by Mao against Japan. In 1949, Chiang fled to Farmosa to seek asylum. Mao was elected the Chairman of the Chinese government. He held his office till his death.

</p>
<p>
          Question 1.
          <br/>
          When was Guomindang Party formed? What were its objectives?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The Guomindang Party of China was established in 1912 by a nationalist leader. Dr. Sun Yat-sen. It had three objectives:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           To liberate China from the foreign domination.
          </li>
<li>
           To establish modem democratic institutions in China.
          </li>
<li>
           To liberate the peasants from the clutches of the feudal lords by introducing reforms.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          Guomindang became popular under Dr. Sun Yat-sen. The objectives of this party had almost the same to that of Communist Party established in 1921. But soon there emerged differences between the two parties. Sun Yat-sen died in 1925 and the leadership of the Guomindang Party passed into the hands of Chiang-Kai-shek. He committed atrocities on the Communists. The Communist leader Mao Tse-tung was compelled to undertake his 6000 miles Long March to increase his influence in North China. In October 1949, he drove away Chiang-Kai-shek to the Island of Formasa (Taiwan) and established Communist rale in China.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The reasons for the failure of Mao’s Great Leap Forward were as follows:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           To enhance the production of crops new agricultural techniques were adopted. The technique was quite faulty. Seeds were sown into the soil beyond their capacity.
          </li>
<li>
           Wheat and maize were grown on the same field. This approach proved futile.
          </li>
<li>
           The officials installed irrigation projects at the wrong places which caused massive erosion.
          </li>
<li>

          Did Deng raise Chinese people’s expectations?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Undoubtedly, Deng raised the Chinese people’s expectations. The people of Beijing and other cities organized demonstrations on a wide scale in the November of 1978. These prompted the government to ban marches. To counter this, the people built ‘Democracy Walls’ all over China. On the walls, people pasted anonymous posters and thus demanding a wide range of human rights. Deng did not approve of this. He said “Without the party China will retrogress into division and confusion”. Its leaders were treated as dissidents. Main leaders were arrested and put behind the bar.

          What do you understand by ‘Open Door Policy’?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The United Stated of America adopted the open door policy in China. European powers made preparations for the partition of China in the 1890’s. The USA felt that it would be left out. So the US proposed the “Open Door Policy” or “Me too policy”. It meant that no country should be discriminated against China by other countries. All countries would have equal trade rights in China. Britain also supported “Open Door Policy”.

          <br/>
          Write in brief about Tiananmen Square Massacre.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The struggle for power broke out in China after the death of Mao Tse-tung. In this struggle, Deng Xioping emerged victorious. His liberal policies were fully opposed by the hardliners in the Communist Party. They were always putting pressure upon Deng to follow the rigid Communist policies. In 1988-89, Deng’s economic reforms proved a failure. The prices of the things went up. In May 1989, the students of Beijing assembled peacefully at the famous Tiananmen Square. They demanded more political reforms and democratic institutions to curb corruption in the party. They organised demonstrations to get their demands accepted. The students organised demonstrations on a large scale. But the government took it as a challenge and crushed the movement ruthlessly. Approximately, 3000 students were gunned down. This massacre was condemned all over the world, but the Communist Government in China did not pay attention to it.

<p>
          Question 7.
          <br/>
          The daily life of Japanese was transformed with the development of Japan. How?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The transformation of Japan into a modern society is reflected with changes in day- to-day life. Previously, the patriarchy system was prevalent. It comprised many generations living together under the same roof and under the control of the head of the family. But as the people became more affluent the new ideas of family also spread. In nuclear families the husband and wife lived together. They earned their livelihood and made home. The new concept of domesticity came into being. The demand for new types of domestic goods, family entertainments and new forms of housing also grew. The construction companies provided homes at cheap rates to the people.

<p>
          Question 8.
          <br/>
          Did Japan’s policy of rapid industrialisation lead to wars with its neighbours and destruction of the environment?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          With the rapid industrialisation, a number of industries were set up. The size of factories also began to increase. Numerous workers were employed in the factories. In 1909, only 1000 workers were employed in the factories. By 1930s, it increased upto 4000. There were numerous factories that employed less than 5 people. With the increase in number of factories the demand for natural resources like timber grew. It led to environmental destruction. Tanaka Shozo launched the first agitation against industrial pollution in 1897 with 800 villagers in a mass protest forcing the government to take action.

          <br/>
          1960’s saw the growth of civil society movements as industrialization had been pushed with utter disregard to its effect on health and the environment. Cadmium poisoning, which led to a painful disease, was an early indicator. It was followed by mercury poisoning in Minamata in the 1960’s and problems caused by air pollution in the early 1970’s. Grassroots pressure groups began to demand recognition of these problems as well as compensation for the victims. Government action and new legal regulations helped to improve conditions. From the mid 1980s there had been an increasing decline in environmental issues as Japan enacted some of the strictest environmental controls in the world.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The important part of the Meiji reform was the modernisation of the economy. Following steps were taken for this:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Japan’s first railway line, between Tokyo and the Port of Yokohama was built in 1870-72.
          </li>
<li>
           Funds were raised by levying an agricultural tax.
          </li>
<li>
           Textile machinery was imported from Europe and foreign technicians were also employed to train workers and also to teach in universities and schools. Japanese students were also sent to abroad.
          </li>
<li>
           In 1872, modem banking institutions were also launched.
          </li>
<li>
           Companies like Mitsubishi and Sumitomo were also helped through subsidies and tax benefits to become major shipbuilders so that Japanese trade was carried through Japanese ships.
          </li>
<li>
           The number of industrial labourer in Japan was 700,000 in 1870 CE which reached upto four million in 1913. Most of the labourers worked in units having less than 5 people.
          </li>
<li>
           By 1925, 21 per cent of the population lived in cities. By 1935, this figure had gone upto 32 per cent.

</ul>
<p>
          Question 2.
          <br/>
          Japan’s transformation into a modem society can also be seen in the changes in everyday life. Comment.
          <br/>
          Answer:.
          <br/>
          Japan’s transformation into a modem society can also be seen as the changes in everyday life. Patriarchal system was in practice. The patriarchal household system comprised many generations living together under the control of the head of the house. More people became affluent. New ideas of the family spread. The new home (Homu as the Japanese say) was that of the nuclear family, where husband and wife lived as breadwinner and homemaker. This new concept of domesticity in turn generated demands for new types of domestic goods, new types of family entertainments, and new forms of housing. In the 1920’s, construction companies made cheap housing available for a down payment of200 yen and a monthly installment of 12 yen for ten years. It was at that time when the salary of a bank employee (a person with higher education) was 40 yen per month.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 3.
          <br/>
          When was CCP founded? What was Russian influence in its formation? Discuss the role of Mao Zedong in it?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The CCP was founded in 1921 scon after the Russian Revolution. The Russian success exercised a powerful influence around the world and leaders such as Lenin and Trotsky went on to establish the Comintern or the Third International in March 1918. It was done to bring about a world government that would end exploitation. The Comintern and the Soviet Union supported Communist parties around the world. They worked within the traditional Marxist understanding that revolution would be brought about by the working class in cities. Its initial appeal across national boundaries was immense. It soon became a tool for Soviet interests and was dissolved in 1943. Mao Zedong (1893-1976), emerged as a major CCP leader. He took a different path by basing his revolutionary programme on the peasantry. His success made the CCP, a powerful political force that ultimately won against the Guomindang.
         </p>
<p>
          Mao Zedong’s radical approach can be seen in Jiangxi, in the mountains, where they camped from 1928 to 1934, secure from Guomindang attacks. A strong Peasants Council (Soviet) was organised, united through confiscation and redistribution of land. Mao, unlike other leaders, stressed the need for an independent government and army. He was quite aware of women’s problems and supported the emergence of rural women’s associations. He also promulgated a new marriage law that forbade arranged marriage, stopped purchase or sale of marriage contracts and simplified divorce.

          There were two governments in China after the end of the First World War. One of the government was controlled by Guomindang, at its headquarter in Canton. The president of this government was Dr. Sun Yat-sen. The other government was led by a military general. It had its headquarter at Beijing. Paris Peace Conference’s decision to hand over Shantung to Japan led to an anti-imperialist upsurge in 1919. A great demonstration was held in China on 4th May, 1919. It spread into various parts of China. It took the form of a movement. It’s main aim was to save China through modem science, democracy and nationalism. They wanted to remove inequality and reduce poverty. Their aim was also to bring economic development. The Russian Revolution had also a great impact on the nationalist movement of China. Communist Party was formed in 1921. Dr. Sun Yat-sen could not gamer the support of western countries. Therefore, he took the help of Soviet Union. The Guomindang and the Chinese Communist Party came together in 1924. Military academy was also set up with the help of Soviet military and political advisers.

          The Examination System:
          <br/>
          Entry to the elite ruling class (about 1.1 million till 1850) had been largely through an examination. This required writing an eight-legged essay [pa-ku wen] in classical Chinese in a prescribed form. The examination was held twice every three years, at different levels and of those allowed to sit only 1-2 per cent passed the first level, usually by the age of 24, to become what was called ‘beautiful talent’. At any given time before 1850 there were about 526,869 civil and 212,330 military provincial (sheng-yuan) degree holders in the whole country. Since there were only 27,000 official positions, many lower-level degree holders did not have jobs.
