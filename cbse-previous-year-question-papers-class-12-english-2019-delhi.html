          Question 1.
          <br/>
          Read the passage given below : [20]
         </p>
<p>
          1. All of the Earth’s ocean share one thing in common: plastic pollution. Discarded plastic bags, cups, and bottles make their way into the sea. Today, it seems that no part of the ocean is safe from plastic trash. In recent years, oceanographers have searched in vain for a pristine marine environment. They have found plastic everywhere they have looked. “It is a common global problem, we can’t point to a single habitat or location with no plastic.”
         </p>
<p>
          2. Plastic harms wildlife and introduces dangerous chemicals into marine ecosystems—
          <br/>
          communities of organisms interacting with their surroundings. Once plastic enters the environment, it lasts a long time. Scientists are working to prevent plastic pollution from entering the sea.
         </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
          3. When people litter, or when trash is not properly disposed of, things like plastic bags, bottles, straws, foam beverage cups get carried to the sea by winds and waterways. About 80 percent of ocean plastic originates on land. The rest comes from marine industries such as shipping and fishing.
         </p>
<p>
          4. In 2015, engineer Jenna Jambeck at the University of Georgia and other researchers calculated that at least 8 million tons of plastic trash is swept into the ocean from coasts every year. That’s the equivalent of a full garbage truck of plastic being dumped into the sea every minute. If current trends in plastic production and disposal continue, that figure will double by 2025. A report published by the World Economic Forum last year predicts that by 2050, ocean plastic will outweigh all the fish in the sea.
         </p>
<p>
          5. In today’s world, plastic is everywhere. It’s found in shoes, clothing, household items, electronics and more. There are different types of plastics, but one thing they all have in common is that is that they’re made of polymers – large molecules made up of repeating units. Their chemical structure gives them a lot of advantages: they’re cheap and easy to manufacture, lightweight, water-resistant, durable, and can be moulded into nearly any shape.
         </p>
<p>
          6. Unfortunately, some of the properties that make plastics great for consumer goods also make them a problem pollutant. Plastic’s durability comes in part from the fact that unlike paper or wood, it does’t biodegrade, or beak down naturally. Instead it just fragments, or breaks into tiny pieces over time. These tiny pieces, known a microplastic, can potentially stick around for hundreds or perhaps even thousands of years.
         </p>
<p>
          7. Another problem with plastics is the other chemicals they contain, like dyes and flame retardants. When plastic isn’t disposed of properly, these additives end up in the environment. Plastic also tends to absorb harmful chemicals from its surroundings. “It’s like a sponge for persistent organic pollutants.” These long-lasting, toxic substances include pesticides and industrial chemicals. If plastic absorbs the chemicals, and marine organisms eat the plastic, they may be exposed to higher concentrations of these contaminants.
         </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
          8. One of the biggest impacts of plastic pollution is its effects on sea life. Seals, sea turtles, and even whales can become entangled in plastic netting. They can starve to death if the plastic restricts their ability to move or eat. Or the plastic can cut into the animals’ skin, causing wounds that develop severe infections.

          9. Sea turtles eat plastic bags and soda-can rings, which resemble jellyfish, their favourite food. Seabirds eat bottle caps or chunks of foam cups. Plastic pieces may make an animal feel full, so it doesn’t eat enough real food to get the nutrients it needs. Plastic can also block an animal’s digestive system, making it unable to eat.
         </p>
<p>
          10. Plastic and its associated pollutant can even make it into our food supply. Scientists recently examined fish and shell-fish bought at markets in California and Indonesia. They found plastic in the guts of more than a quarter of samples purchased at both locations. In organisms that people eat whole, such as sardines and oysters, that ‘means we’re eating plastic too. In larger fish, chemicals from plastic may seep into their muscles and other tissues that people consume.
         </p>
<p>
          11. One way to keep the ocean cleaner and healthier is through cleanup efforts. A lot of plastic waste caught in ocean currents eventually washes up on beaches. Removing it can prevent it from blowing out to sea again. Beach clean-up is ocean clean-up.
         </p>
<p>
          12. Cleanup efforts can’t reach every corner of the ocean or track down every bit of microplastic. That means it’s critical to cut down on the amount of plastic that reaches the sea in the first place. Scientists are working towards new materials that are safer for the environment. For example, Jambeck and her colleagues are currently testing a new polymer that breaks down more easily in seawater.
         </p>
<p>
          13. “Individual actions make a big difference,” says Jambeck. Disposing of plastic properly for recycling or trash collection is a key step. “And simple things like reusable water bottles, mugs, and bags really cut down on waste,” she says. Skipping straws or using paper ones helps too. Ocean pollution can seem overwhelming, but it’s something everyone can help address. This is a problem we can really do something about.

          Question 1.2.
          <br/>
          Answer the following question briefly: [1 × 6 = 6]
          <br/>
          (i) Which articles made of plastic generally cause pollution in the sea ?
          <br/>
          (ii) How does plastic in oceans harm marine ecosystems?
          <br/>
          (iii) How is microplastic formed?
          <br/>
          (iv) Why is plastic compared to a sponge?
          <br/>
          (v) What is the biggest impact of plastic pollution on sea life?
          <br/>
          (vi) How are scientists trying to reduce the plastic pollutants?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) Discarded plastic bags, cups and bottles cause pollution in the sea.
          <br/>
          (ii) Plastic absorbs dangerous chemicals from its surroundings that include pesticides and other industrial chemicals. When marine life eats the plastic, they may be exposed to higher concentration of these contaminants.
          <br/>
          (iii) Plastic doesn’t biodegrade or breakdown naturally. It just breaks into tiny pieces which are known as microplastic.
          <br/>
          (iv) Plastic tends to absorb harmful chemicals from its surroundings which is why it is compared to a sponge. It’s like a sponge for persistent organic pollutants.
          <br/>
          (v) The biggest impact of plastic pollution on the life is that seals, sea turtles and even whales can become entangled in plastic netting. They can starve to death if plastic restricts their ability to move or eat. It can cut into the animals’ skin and may cause wounds.
          <br/>
          (vi) To reduce the plastic pollutants, scientists are working towards new materials that are safer for the environment. They are testing a new polymer that breaks down more easily in seawater.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 1.3.
          <br/>
          Answer any three of the following questions in 25-30 words each: [2 × 3 = 6]
          <br/>
          (i) How does plastic waste enter the ocean?
          <br/>
          (ii) How is it true to say that plastic is everywhere in today’s world?
          <br/>
          (iii) Which property of plastic makes it a problem pollutant?
          <br/>
          (iv) What has scientist Jambeck suggested for having cleaner and healthier oceans?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) When people litter or when trash is not properly disposed of, things like plastic bags, bottles, straws, foam, beverage cups get carried to the sea by winds and waterways. This is how plastic waste enters the oceans. About 80% of ocean plastic originates on land. The rest comes from marine industries such as shipping and fishing.
          <br/>
          (ii) Its true to say that in today’s world, plastic is everywhere as it’s found in shoes, clothing, household items, electronics and more.
          <br/>
          (iii) Some of the properties of plastic make it a problem pollutant. Unlike paper or wood, it doesn’t biodegrade or breakdown naturally. Instead, it just fragments or breaks into tiny pieces known as microplastic which potentially sticks around for hundreds or perhaps thousands of years.
          <br/>
          (iv) Jambeck has suggested that individual actions make a big difference. Disposing of plastics properly for recycling or trash collection is a key step. Skipping straws or using paper ones helps too.
         </p>

          Question 1.4.
          <br/>
          Pick out the words/phrases from the passage which are similar in meaning to the following: [1 × 3 = 3]
          <br/>
          (i) unspoiled (para 1)
          <br/>
          (ii) long lasting (para 5)
          <br/>
          (iii) people working together (para 12)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) pristine
          <br/>
          (ii) durable
          <br/>
          (iii) colleagues
         </p>
<p>
          Question 2.
          <br/>
          Read the passage given below: [10]
          <br/>
          1. Getting enough sleep is an important as taking time out to relax. A good night’s sleep is essential for preserving the health of your brain and gives you the best chance to meet the coming day with a razor sharp mind. An average person needs about six to eight hour sleep a night—although it is also true that you need slightly less than this, as you grow older-another advantage of aging stress and sleep deprivation often feed on each other, since stress tends to make it harder for you to fall asleep at night and sleep deprivation in itself causes stress.
         </p>
<p>
          2. Eventually, too little sleep can dramatically interfere with the performance of your memory-something you obviously want to prevent. If you are not getting enough sleep, try going to bed 30 to 60 minutes earlier than your normal bed time for a few days. Lie down on the bed and try to relax by dissociating yourself from your daily routine work. This is normally enough to catch up on any sleep deprivation.
         </p>
<p>
          3. If, however, you suffer from insomnia you should seek the advice of your doctor. The chances are it is already affecting your ability to remember and recall information – and if you are struggling to improve your memory scores, this could be at the root of your problem. Prolonged periods of insufficient sleep can deplete your immune system, make you more accident prone and even cause depression—this can also reinforce a more negative outlook on life, which can contribute to your stress burden. The good news is that your memory and mood should automatically improve once you improve your sleep patterns. Tackle your sleep issues and everything else should fall into place.
         </p>
<p>
          4. Because stress management is so essential to maximize your brain power, if you are not in the habit of setting aside time to relax, make it a priority to do so. Even a minute or two of deep breathing can start to work wonders. Often the best ideas and memories can come to you when you are in a state of relaxation as it is during these moments that you brain stores, processes and plays with the information it has received.
         </p>
<p>
          5. Meditation has long been part of religious and spiritual life, specially in Asia. Today, more and more people are adopting it in Western countries also, for its value of developing peace of mind and lowering stress. There is some evidence that regular meditation can have real sleep gain and health benefits particularly in terms of protecting your brain against aging.

          SUMMARY:
         </p>
<p>
          Good sleep is necessary for a healthy brain. Six to eight hours sleep a night is required for an average person! Too little sleep or insomnia interferes with the performance of memory and can lead to depression. It further adds on to stress burden. Good sleep patterns help to improve mood and memory. Besides, stress management also maximizes brain power. Relaxed mind is a home for best ideas and memories. Meditation, which has been a part of religious and spiritual life particularly in Asia, develops peace of mind and lowers stress, regains sleep and health. Western countries are also adopting meditation for the same reason.

          Subject: Importance of Education for Women
          <br/>
          Sir,
          <br/>
          Through the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I would like to highlight the issue of women education in our country. Education plays a vital role in improving the socio-economic conditions of our nation and educating women holds an important position in this regard. Earlier, women’s education was forbidden in our society but today women are highly educated and qualified professionals and scholars. There are women judges, doctors, executives, entrepreneurs, engineers, pilots and sportspersons in the country today. Women are present in every walk of life, competing with men quite successfully and this is possible only because they are given proper education facilities and opportunities. They can prove to be productive for the welfare of the society as well as the country if their education is given due importance like their male counterparts. Today, women even provide financial support to their family also.
         </p>
<p>
          It is said that a child’s first school is her/his home and for that purpose, the mother needs to be educated enough. This not only helps the child but also helps in improving women’s status and position in her family. For a developing country like India where women form half of the population, it’s important to educate women for the betterment of the their family, society and in turn for the nation.
          <br/>
          I hope my thoughts will persuade the people to act towards the betterment of women.
          <br/>
          Thanking You
          <br/>
          Yours faithfully

          Subject. : Complaint regarding defective refrigerator
          <br/>
          Sir,
          <br/>
          Two months ago, I purchased a double door five star Samsung refrigerator in the colour cherry red, model no. A 233408 vide cash memo no. 453, dated 10th June, 20XX from your showroom. I was extremely happy to have purchased such a branded product but to my utter disappointment, it has not been working properly for the past few days.
          <br/>
          Though for the first six weeks, it gave a trouble- free service but after that it started having problems. Its cooling has stopped and it makes a lot of noise too. Sometimes it even gives shock and gets heated quickly.

          <br/>
          CAPITAL PUNISHMENT SHOULD BE ABOLISHED
          <br/>
          FOR THE MOTION:
          <br/>
          Honorable Judges, Respected Principal, Teachers and my dear friends! Good Morning. Today I feel privileged to present my views in favour of the motion ‘Capital Punishment should be abolished’. Before starting of, I would like to explain what ‘Capital punishment’ is? It is actually the death penalty given by the government of a country to the person who has committed any serious crime. In my opinion, ‘Capital Punishment’ should be abolished. By giving someone a death penalty, it doesn’t mean that the crime is over or the victim is given justice. Instead, they should be punished in such a way that would make them realize and feel the pain and embarrassment from deep inside the heart. As we know that the crime graph is rising higher day by day and it’s not possible to hang all the criminals to death for their heinous crimes. So the accused must be given punishment that would make others afraid and they dare not think of committing crimes in future.
         </p>
<p>
          Moreover, death penalty is not for the democratic countries and civilized societies. It is not considered just and appropriate as in some cases influential and rich people hire good and reputed lawyers and could be saved if it falls on them. But on the other hand, those who cannot afford a good lawyer, succumb to death. Therefore, it is not justified. Rather imprisonment is far better to make a criminal realize his fault and to give him an opportunity to reform himself.
         </p>
<p>
          AGAINST THE MOTION:
         </p>
<p>
          Honorable Judges, Respected Principal, Teachers and my dear friends ! Good Morning. Today I stand before you to present my views against the motion ‘Capital Punishment should be abolished’.
         </p>
<p>
          For any crime there is a punishment and certain crimes are so ghasly for which capital punishment must be given to the criminals, otherwise the jutice would be denied to the victim. Besides, the criminals will get the opportunity to commit a more crimes. If they wouldn’t the fear of death, they would continue their wrongdoings. If capital punishment will be abolished, the other criminals will feel free to do such things in future which is unacceptable in the society as well as in the country. When a person commits a crime, he tries to escape the punishment by offering bribe to the police officials or jail authorities or hiring an influential lawyer. Even if he gets life imprisonment, it is nothing in front of the pain he caused to the victim.
         </p>
<p>
          Countries like United States of America give capital punishment to the criminals to lower the crime rates. If a person commits serious crimes like murder or rape, they should be given death penalty so as to give perceptual relief to the victim’s relatives. In a lot of cases, when the criminals are excused, they repeat the gruesome crimes. To avoid such situation, death penalty is must as it would refrain others from doing crimes and make the society safe. It is an appropriate punishment for the accused and also for those who continue to commit crimes even after being released from the jail.

          IMPACT OF YOGA IN OUR LIFE
          <br/>
          By Shivam/Shabnam
          <br/>
          Good Morning everybody, I am Shivam/ Shabnam, a student of class XII of your school. It is a great opportunity for me to share my views on the topic ‘Impact of Yoga in our life’ in today’s assembly.
          <br/>
          Yoga is not merely a physical exercise which includes stretching, breathing or twisting the body in different ways, but it results into a healthy development of mind, body and soul. Today’s sedentary lifestyle has invited many diseases where man has limited time to spare for his health. It is also important for good concentration and peace of mind. With regular practice of yoga, we tend to become more sensitive to the kind of food our body asks. With the genuine effort made by our honorable Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi, it is celebrated every year on 21st June. Not only Indians but the whole world has accepted the power of yoga. A few minutes of yoga helps to get relief from stress. It helps detox the body and de-stress the mind. Yoga is the best way to calm a disturbed mind and increase the level of well-being in a person. On the other hand, yoga postures massage organs and strengthen muscles; breathing techniques and meditation release stress and improve immune system. Yoga and meditation work on keeping the mind happy and peaceful. When we feel drained out of energy, a few minutes of yoga can provide the freshness and energy back to our body. It also helps in improving body postures. Today, students face many problems due to the burden of studies and feel depressed but yoga acts as the stress buster for them. In many schools yoga is practiced on the daily basis as a part of curriculum. Hence, we too should add yoga to our daily routines for a healthy life.

          IMPORTANCE OF HARD WORK AND PUNCTUALITY IN STUDENT’S LIFE
          <br/>
          By Kanha/Kavya
          <br/>
          Punctuality is a trait which makes a man successful in life and if it is accompanied with hard work, nothing can stop him from reaching the zenith of success. In a student’s life, punctuality is must so that he/she can achieve good scores. A hard working and punctual student is respected and liked by all whether it is his teachers, society, family or friends. Students should follow the examples of great leaders ” like Abdul Kalam Azad in order to achieve success and fame. Being punctual refers to the quality to be on time and to complete every task in a systematic way. It encourages the student to do the work on time and keep an update of everything. This quality can be developed at any stage of life but if it is developed during childhood, it would prove to be better. Hard work and punctuality gives fruitful results in the long run. Lack of punctuality and hard work causes harmful effects. It is only the result of hard work and efforts of the scientists that the world has developed so far. Only hard work and punctuality make a student stand aloft the others and lack such trait make them lag behind. It is truly said that time is priceless. Once you have lost it, you can never get it back.

One may think that the life of people living on the periphery of the national capital must be very easy-going, rich and good but it is all opposite. They have no identity or permits except ration cards as food is more important to them than any identity. Children grow up only to become the supporters of their parents in survival. To them, garbage means ‘gold’. It is their daily bread, a roof over their heads. It is a gift for them because whenever they find some silver coin in a heap of garbage, they hope to survive on it for some days.

Due to his loneliness, he wants someone to talk to. So he becomes talkative and friendly with the peddler and allows him to have a conversation with him. He not only gives him a shelter but also gives him the food to eat and tobacco to smoke. He tells the peddler everything about himself and his earnings. On the other hand, the iron master and his daughter are also lonely. They have lots of money but no companion and so they request the peddler to spend Christmas with them.

          Answer:
          <br/>
          INDULGENCE OF THE YOUTH IN THE USE OF THE ‘INTERNET’ IS A GREAT BANE FOR THE MOTION:
          <br/>
          Honorable Judges, Respected Principal, Teachers and my dear friends! Good Morning.
          <br/>
          Today, I stand before you to speak in favour of the motion ‘Indulgence of the youth in the use of internet is a great bane for them’.
         </p>
<p>
          Today we are living in a highly-technological and advanced world. Modern gadgets and the internet has become an integral part of the youth’s life. They live in a fascinating world where they want everything to move fast. Even while looking for the meaning of a word, the youngsters don’t use dictionary, instead they switch over the internet to look for it. While scrolling through Facebook or Instagram, they feel that everyone is living a better life than them. This leads to frustration. This social media behavior is linked with major depression disorder. E-books have replaced printed books. An e-book reader uses rapidly changing technology to read books in a digital format. Then comes the mobile phones. There is no doubt that mobile phones have brought revolution in the field of communication and are considered as the biggest blessing of modem science. But it proves to be the most hazardous gadget as it distracts the youth from studies and their academic goals. Computers and internet have made every possible information accessible at one click but there are certain disadvantages which can’t be overlooked. Over-dependency upon internet has made life sedentary which in turn, leads to many disorders like obesity, diabetes, heart problems and blood pressure. Researches have proved over use of internet hampers intellectual growth, language development and innovative thinking. Therefore, I must say that too much indulgence in the use of internet is a great bane for the youth.
         </p>
<p>
          AGAINST THE MOTION:
          <br/>
          Honorable Judges, Respected Principal, Teachers and my dear friends! Good Morning. Today, I stand before you to speak against the motion ‘Indulgence of the youth in the use of internet is a great bane for them.’
         </p>
<p>
          In my view, indulgence of the youth in the use of internet is not a bane; rather it is a boon for them. The internet revolution has completely changed the lives of the youth today. The number of internet user has increased a lot due to easy accessibility and affordability. Whether it is homework, chatting, e-mailing, project work, information gathering or any other purpose, internet has occupied its solid space in every home. The internet provides information on any topic and youth considers it the best source of gaining knowledge as it saves their time and energy comparatively if they look into books or anywhere else. Therefore, books have taken a back seat in this regard and internet has become more reliable. It is supposed to be multitasking and provides knowledge on the basis of students’ ability and understanding. It makes the routine lesson interesting, motivating and exciting for students. It is accompanied with audio-visual aids which give pleasure in learning and the students’ quest to know more increases. The internet is not only the source of getting information but it is equally an efficient means of communication. The world has shrunk due to it because e-mailing and chatting have paved a path to discuss and spread education on a large scale.

          THE IMPORTANCE OF INDOOR GAMES
          <br/>
          Good Morning everybody! Today as we observe that life in metro cities has become very difficult due to the increasing rate of pollution, it’s my duty to count on the hazardous consequences of the outdoor activities for all the students. Whenever we go out, we inhale smoke and poisonous gases along with oxygen. The burden of overgrowing population, unrestricted cutting of trees and unlimited urbanization has resulted in excessive pollution and so it has become impossible to do any outdoor exercise or morning and evening walk especially during harsh winters. Therefore, I would say that students must fully utilize the facilities of sports like badminton, basketball etc. available in the school as for good mental growth, we cannot deny the importance of these games. It helps to interact with each other as well. Children exchange ideas and thoughts while playing. As it is not possible to avail these facilities outside, our school has started the games within school premises. Trained coaches have been appointed for the students keeping in view the interest of the children in their respective field of interest. Students can play during zero periods and before the assembly. Provisions have been also made for evening training classes. These games are must for the children’s balanced personality. Moreover, physical activities provide an outlet for the surplus energy.
          <br/>
          Therefore, I would like all the students to make use of the sports facilities available in the school for which no extra fee would be charged.
          <br/>
          Thank you !

          Question 9.

          Answer any one of the following questions in 120-150 words: [6]
          <br/>
          (i) What are the hazards of working in a glass bangle industry ?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Hazards of working in a glass bangle factory are manifold. It is harmful for the eyes of the maker as the polishing of the glass bangles produces dust which may result into blindness. Working in the glass furnaces with high temperature and in dingy cells without proper ventilation and light take away the brightness of eyes. Similarly, during the welding work in the glass factory, sitting in dark rooms in front of flickering lamps is equally harmful for the eyes and many children lose their eyesight even before they grow up. Their eyes become so accustomed to that light that they cannot see the natural daylight outside. There are chances of skin bum too. Working in glass bangle industries leaves an adverse effect on the health of the workers. Besides the workers are physically, emotionally and psychologically hurt too. They are exploited by middlemen, policemen, sahukars, bureaucrats and politicians and it is impossible for them to come out of their trap.

          (iii) What was Sophie’s dream ? How was it unrealistic ? How was she different from Jansie ?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Sophie was a day dreamer like all the other adolescents of her age. She was a victim of all the wild fantasies and totally cut off from the realities of life. Although she belonged to a lower middle-class family, she was blind to the bitter truth of life. She dreamt of an imaginary life, full of beautiful things in which she owned a boutique. She also dreamt of becoming an actress as there was lot of money and fame in that profession. She wanted to be a fashion designer too. It can be said that she wanted to lead a lavish and grand life which was not possible. Her dreams were unrealistic in the sense that ultimately she would have to work in a biscuit factory as planned.
         </p>
<p>
          On the other hand, Jansie was realistic and practical. Sophie and Jansie were classmates and friends but Sophie didn’t want to tell anything to Jansie as she would spread her secrets in the whole neighbourhood. Jansie didn’t possess unrealistic dreams. She dissuaded Sophie too from having such dreams so as to avoid depression and frustration later.

          People like to travel to their places of work in their own cars. It is comfortable and they also reach their destinations more or less in time. However, use of private vehicles leads to pollution and traffic jams and it is expensive – also. Air-conditioned public buses, which
          <br/>
          are smaller in size, seating 15-20 people and tickets, reasonably priced can be a boon for the people. Write an article in 150-200 words on the topic. ‘Need of better Public Transport.’ You are Resham/Rehana. [10]

          NEED OF BETTER PUBLIC TRANSPORT
          <br/>
          By Resham/Rehana
          <br/>
          We all know that travelling by a private vehicle is very convenient and takes far less time than public transport but simultaneously/it leads to pollution and traffic jams. Moreover, they prove to be extremely expensive as the petrol prices are increasing day by day. In that case, there is a serious need of better public transport which is comfortable and can accommodate 15 to 20 people at a time. The ticket prices should also be reasonable so that everyone can afford it. It is a known fact that in metro cities, from every house, a minimum of two to three vehicles are used by the members for going to their working places. Sometimes they remain stranded in their vehicles for long hours due to heavy traffic jams which result into excessive emission of polluted gases in the atmosphere and delay to reach their destinations.
          <br/>
          So it would be far better if the government provides good public transport facilities which could be accessible to all. It would create lot of convenience for the general public and daily commuters. It has many social, economic and environmental benefits. Social benefits of using public transport are multifold. It helps in developing a sense of being a community among people. They feel a connection with those who are traveling with them. It encourages people to have a healthy lifestyle as they walk to their stations, stands or stops. Moreover, it is less stressful as it saves a lot of time. Economic benefits include less expenditure of money on buying cars or spending money on its maintenance. Travelling by public transport is much cheaper than private transport. It also reduces pollution and road congestion thus, helps in environmental conservation.

          (i) What kind of life did children living in Seemapuri lead ?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Seemapuri is a settlement of more than 10,000 rag pickers situated on the periphery of Delhi. The people living there have migrated from Bangladesh. They lived in the structures of mud with roofs of tin and tarpaulin. They didn’t have any identity or permits. Their children also helped them in earning their livelihood. Saheb was one of the children who lived here. He was from a poor family of Bangladesh. In order to earn their livelihood, his family shifted to Delhi where they settled in Seemapuri. But when they found no work to do, they became rag pickers. They had to search the garbage like others for something to make their livelihood. Sahib, whose age was to enjoy the life, go to school and live his childhood, also looked into the heaps of garbage for some coins. It was a tedious task as they used to leave their houses barefoot early in the morning with a bag on their shoulders. They did not have chappals, so they were not in a habit to wear them. Because their fields and homes were swept away in the flood in Bangladesh, so they came to the big city with a hope but even here they led a miserable life.

          (ii) How did the crofter tempt the peddler to steal his money ? How did it change the peddler’s life ?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The peddler was a lonely man who looked like a beggar. He was a homeless wanderer who used to sell rattraps. Once he knocked the door of a crofter who was equally lonely like him for a night stay. He was received by the crofter warmly and cheerfully. Crofter was proud of his cow that gave him enough milk. So he told the peddler about the thirty kronors he got by selling the milk of the cow and he used to keep his money in a leather pouch that hung from a nail in the window frame. He felt that the peddler did not believe him so he showed the money to convince him.
          <br/>
          Having stolen the money, the peddler didn’t find it safe to walk along the public highway. So he went through the woods and got lost. Here, he thought that the whole world was a rattrap and the money he had stolen was a bait and he himself was trapped in it. Later, he regretted for stealing the crofter’s money so much so that when Edla invited him for Christmas, he returned the stolen money to her.

          (iii) What did Sophie tell her father and her brother about her ‘meeting(s)’ with Danny Casey ? How did each of them react ?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Danny Casey was a young footballer who played for Ireland. Sophie considered him a hero whom she worshipped. She was always occupied with his thoughts. She told her brother Geoff that she had met Danny Casey in the arcade while she was looking at the clothes in Royce’s window. Casey came and stood by her. She recognized him and then they started talking. Then she asked for an autograph but neither of them had a pen or paper. She further told her brother that Danny’s eyes were green. He was gentle but was not very tall. When her brother told about this to their father, he didn’t believe in her story at all as he knew her habit of indulging in wild fantasies. His expression was one of disdain. He called this story as one of her many wild stories and warned her against them as they would land her in trouble.
