      Any two limitations or weaknesses of a computer system are as follows :
     </p>
<ol>
<li>
       Lack of intelligence/Lack of decision making power : No doubt, computer is a powerful machine but cannot decide on its own that what it is supposed to do as a machine. This is a serious limitation of a computer system and it is an artificially intelligent machine.
      </li>
<li>
       Need of special language : A computer can understand only the binary language, in which the information is represented in terms of only two symbols, namely 0 and 1. This is not the natural language of human beings and learning of the binary language is not an easy task.

      Speed, accuracy, diligence, storage capability and versatility are some of the key characteristics of a computer. A brief overview of these characteristics are :
     </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
        Speed :
       </strong>
       The computer can process data very fast, at the rate of millions of instructions per second. Some calculations that would have taken hours and days to complete otherwise, can be completed in a few seconds using the computer.
      </li>
<li>
<strong>
        Accuracy :
       </strong>
       Computer provides a high degree of accuracy. For example : the computer can accurately give the result of division of any two numbers up to 30 decimal places.
      </li>
<li>
<strong>
        Diligence :
       </strong>
       When used for a longer period of time, the computer does not get tired or fatigued. It can perform long and complex calculations with the same speed and accuracy from the start till the end.
      </li>
<li>
<strong>
        Storage Capability :
       </strong>
       Large volumes of data
       <br/>
       and information can be stored in the computer and also retrieved whenever required. A limited amount of data can be stored temporarily in the primary memory. Secondary storage devices like DVD and compact disk can store a large amount of data permanently.

      There are three types of computers according to the technology. These are :
      <br/>
      (i)  Digital Computers
      <br/>
      (ii) Analog Computers
      <br/>
      (iii) Hybrid Computers
     </p>
<ol>
<li>
       Digital Computers : The computer which works on the digital signals or deals with discrete digital signals is called digital computer.
      </li>
<li>
       Analog Computers : The computer which works on physical analogies or physical quantities is called analog computer. It is a special purpose computer used to design specific problems.
      </li>
<li>
       Hybrid Computers : A computer which has the features of both analog and digital computers is called hybrid computer.

      In 1889, Herman Hollerith invented a machine which worked on electricity for the first time. One machine was used for recording data and the other one was used for doing calculations on that recorded data. His machine was capable of reading both numbers and letters. Herman Hollerith introduced the concept of punched cards. Hollerith invented the tabulating machine that could read Information from punched cards.

      Booting is the process of restarting a computer or its operating system software. It starts with switching on the computer and ends when the operating System is loaded in main memory and the computer is ready to take commands from the user.
      <br/>
      Booting is of two types :
     </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
        Cold booting :
       </strong>
       When the computer is started after having been switched off.
      </li>
<li>
<strong>
        Warm booting :
       </strong>
       When the operating system alone is restarted after a system crash or freeze.
      </li>
</ol>
