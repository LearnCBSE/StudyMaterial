<strong>
           Question 1. Discuss the formalities involved in getting an export license.
          </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
           Answer:
          </strong>
          Before exporting goods, it is mandatory for exporters and export firms to fulfill the legal formalities, including securing an export license. The following are the formalities to obtain an export license.
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
            Bank account number:
           </strong>
           An exporter must open an account in a bank authorised by the Reserve Bank of India and get an account number.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            IEC code:
           </strong>
           An export firm must obtain an IEC (Importer Exporter Code) from the Directorate General for Foreign Trade (DGFT) or the Regional Import Export Licensing Authority by submitting documents such as the exporter’s profile, prescribed certificates, two attested photographs and details of non-resident interest.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Registration-cum-membership certificate:
           </strong>
           An export firm should get itself registered with the appropriate Export Promotion Council, such as the Engineering
           <br/>
           Export Promotion Council (EEPC) and the Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC), and obtain a Registration-Cum-Membership Certificate (RCMC).
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Registration with ECGC:
           </strong>
           An export firm must also get itself registered with the ECGC (Export Credit and Guarantee Corporation) in order to protect itself from any uncertainties in payments brought upon by political or commercial risks.
          </li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
           Question 2. Why is it necessary to get registered with an Export Promotion Council?
          </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
           Answer:
          </strong>
          If a firm wants to export goods, then it must first obtain an export license. In order to obtain an export license, the firm is required to register itself with the Appropriate Export Promotion Council, such as the Engineering Export Promotion Council (EEPC) and the Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC). Such councils are set up by the government for promoting the export of various goods falling under their purview. O ice the registration is complete, the firm obtains the Registration-Cum-Membership Certificate (RCMC). This in turn enables it to take advantage of the benefits made available to export firms by the government. Thus, it is necessary for export firms to register themselves with an Export Promotion Council.
         </p>

<strong>
           Question 3. What is IEC number?
          </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
           Answer:
          </strong>
          An TEC number refers to the ‘Importer Exporter Code number. It is a 10-digit number granted by the Directorate General for Foreign Trade (DGFT) to an import/export firm depending upon the firm’s credibility. It is essential for an importer/ exporter to obtain this number as it is to be provided in various import/export documents. In order to obtain this number, an export or import firm submits an application to the DGFT or the Regional Import Export Licensing Authority along with documents and information such as the profile of the importer/exporter, fee receipt from a bank, non-resident’s interest details, certificate from the banker on the prescribed form, two photographs attested by the banker and a declaration about the applicant’s non-association with firms placed in the caution list. Once the final submission is done and authenticated, the DGFT or the Regional Import Export Licensing Authority issues an IEC number to the importer/exporter, which helps the firm concerned in availing itself of benefits granted by the DGFT to importers/exporters.

<strong>
           Question 4. What is pre-shipment finance?
          </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
           Answer:
          </strong>
          As soon as order is confirmed and letter of credit is received, the exporter approaches the bank to receive pre-shipment finance which he needs to buy raw materials and other inputs to produce good to be exported. Firms require finance for various activities such as purchase of raw material and manufacture of goods. In the case of exporters, this finance is obtained from banks in the form of advances known as pre-shipment finance. These advances are called pre-shipment finance as they are used in operations completed before the final shipment of goods takes place. This type of credit is obtained by an exporter from his or her banker after the order has been confirmed and the letter of credit has been received from the importer. Once the bank extends credit, the exporter uses the funds to purchase raw materials to undertake production. Preshipment finance is also used for processing and packaging goods and transporting them to ports for shipment.
         </p>

<strong>
           Question 5. Why is it necessary for an export firm to go in for pre-shipment inspection?
          </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
           Answer:
          </strong>
          Pre-shipment inspection refers to the inspection of goods before their final shipment in order to ensure that only quality goods are exported. The Government has initiated measures such as compulsory inspection of certain goods by promulgating the Export Quality and Inspection Act, 1963, and designating various agencies to undertake inspection. Exporters are required to contact the Export Inspection Agency (EIA) or another designated agency and obtain an inspection certificate after getting the goods checked. However, in the case of goods exported by star trading houses, export houses, 100 per cent export-oriented units and industrial units set up in Export Processing Zones (EPZs) or Special Economic Zones (SEZs), no such inspection is required.
         </p>

<strong>
           Question 6. Discuss the procedure related to excise clearance of goods.
          </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
           Answer:
          </strong>
          Excise duty is the amount payable on raw materials used in the manufacture of goods.
          <br/>
          Exporters are required to pay excise duty and get excise clearance. In order to get excise clearance, a manufacturer must first submit an invoice to the Regional Excise Commissioner. The Excise Commissioner then examines the invoice and, if satisfied, issues the excise clearance to the manufacturer. However, in many cases, the government may either exempt a manufacturer from payment of excise duty or refund it after payment in case the manufactured goods are meant for export. The basic objective of such exemptions is to promote the export of goods and provide a competitive market for Indian exports in the world market.

<strong>
           Question 7. Explain briefly the process of customs clearance of export goods.
          </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
           Answer:
          </strong>
          Before the final loading of goods for export, it is necessary for the exporter to get the goods cleared by customs. This is known as Securing Customs Clearance. In this regard, an exporter first requires to submit the following documents to the customs appraiser at the Customs House:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           Shipping bill
          </li>
<li>
           Export order
          </li>
<li>
           Letter of credit
          </li>
<li>
           Commercial invoice
          </li>
<li>
           Certificate of origin
          </li>
<li>
           Certificate of inspection, if necessary
          </li>
<li>
           Marine insurance policy.
          </li>
</ol>
<p>
          After the submission of the documents, a carting order is obtained from the superintendent of the port concerned. The carting order acts as a gate pass for the cargo to enter the dock as it gives the necessary instructions to the staff. The physical movement of cargo then takes place from the dock to the port area and finally the goods are stored in an appropriate storage. It may not be possible for the exporter to be present at all times for performing these formalities, and therefore the task is assigned to a Clearing and Forwarding (C and F) agent.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Question 8. What is Bill of Lading? How does it differ from bill of entry?
          </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
           Answer:
          </strong>
          Bill of Lading is an essential document required at the time of an export transaction. It is issued by the shipping company as a token of acceptance that the goods have been put on board in its vessel. A Bill of Lading is an undertaking from the shipping company to transfer the goods to the port of destination. Bills of Lading are freely transferable.
          <br/>
          In contrast, a Bill of Entry is required at the time of an import transaction. It is a form supplied by the customs office and filled by the importer once the goods are received. A Bill of Entry is submitted at the customs office with information such as the name and address of the importer, name of the ship in which the goods were transported, number of packages, marks on the package, description of imported goods, quantity and value of the imported goods, name and address of the exporter, port of destination and customs duty payable.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Question 9. What is Shipping Bill?
          </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
           Answer:
          </strong>
          Shipping Bill contains information about the goods that are exported. That is, it contains particulars such as’the name of the vessel, port at which the goods are to be discharged, country of final destination and exporter’s name and address. A Shipping Bill is essential for an export transaction as it is on the basis of this document that the customs grants clearance to the export.

<strong>
           Question 10. Explain the meaning of Mate’s Receipt.
          </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
           Answer:
          </strong>
          Mate’s Receipt is issued by the captain or commanding officer of a ship to an exporter. This receipt acts as evidence that the exporter’s cargo has been loaded on the ship. It contains information such as the name of the vessel, berth, date of shipment, condition of the cargo when it was loaded, description of the packages of the cargo, number of packages and marks on the packages. Once the port dues are received, the port superintendent gives the Mate’s Receipt to the C and F agent concerned. It is only after the Mate’s Receipt has been obtained that the shipping company will issue the bill of lading.

<strong>
           Question 11. What is a Letter of Credit? Why does an exporter need this document?
          </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
           Answer:
          </strong>
          Letter of Credit is issued by the bank of an importer guaranteeing to honour a draft of a certain amount drawn on it by the exporter. It is an important document because, in international transactions, there is always a risk of the importer defaulting on payment once the goods are received. Thus, to minimise the risk of such defaults, the exporter often demands a letter of credit. A letter of credit enables the exporter to assess the credit worthiness of the importer. It is the most appropriate and secure method of payment for settling an international transaction.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Question 12. Discuss the process involved in securing for exports.
          </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
           Answer:
          </strong>
          Once the goods for export are shipped, the importer is informed about the shipment by the exporter. However, to claim the title of the goods, the importer is required to submit various documents, such as a copy of the invoice, bill of lading, packaging list, insurance policy, certificate of origin and letter of credit. These documents are sent by the exporter and provided by the exporter’s bank only when the bill of exchange has been signed and accepted by the importer. The bill of exchange states the amount that the importer must pay to the bearer of the bill. Once the bill is received and accepted, the importer’s bank is instructed by the importer to transfer money to the exporter’s bank account.
          <br/>
          In case the exporter wants immediate payment from his or her bank even if the payment has not been released by the importer, then he or she can secure payment by signing a letter of indemnity. This letter acts as an undertaking that the exporter will indemnify the bank, along with the accrued interest, in case of non-payment by the importer.
          <br/>
          Last, when the exporter receives the payment from the bank, he or she obtains a bank certificate of payment. This certificate states that the necessary documents along with the bill of exchange have been presented to the importer for payment and that the payment has been received in accordance with the exchange control regulations.

          </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
           Answer:
          </strong>
          Rekha Garments will have to adopt the following procedures given below to execute the export order.
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           As the exporter, it should first assess the credit worthiness of the importer. Swift Imports, through an enquiry. It should then ask for a letter of credit from the importer’s bank, guaranteeing to honour a draft of a specified amount drawn on it by the exporter.
          </li>
<li>
           Once Rekha Garments is assured that it will be paid for the goods, it will need to register itself and secure an Importer Exporter Code number in order to obtain an export license.
          </li>
<li>
           After obtaining the license, it should acquire pre-shipment finance from a bank in order to purchase raw materials to undertake production and packaging.
          </li>
<li>
           With the finance made available, Rekha Garments can procure the raw materials and other inputs required and start the production process.
          </li>
<li>
           After the goods are produced, Rekha Garments must get them inspected before exporting them. For this inspection, it must contact the Export Inspection Agency (EIA) or another designated agency and obtain a certificate of inspection.
          </li>
<li>
           The exporter then needs to secure excise clearance, for which it must submit an invoice to the regional excise commissioner. The excise commissioner then examines the invoice and, if satisfied, issues the excise clearance to the exporter.
          </li>
<li>
           Once the excise clearance is received, Rekha Garments needs a certificate of origin, which specifies the country in which the goods are being produced. It allows the importer to claim tariff concessions and other exemptions, if any.
          </li>
<li>
           The next step is for the exporter to submit an application to a shipping company for booking shipping space in a vessel. In the application, it must provide details such as the type of goods to be shipped and the port of destination. After the application is received, the shipping company will issue a shipping order to the captain of its ship to inform him or her that the specified goods will be received on board after the customs clearance.
          </li>
<li>
           The goods are then properly packed and labelled with Ml the necessary information such as the importer’s name, port of destination, and gross and net weight of the goods.
          </li>
<li>
           Once the goods are ready for export, Rekha Garments must insure the goods against perils of the sea or any related damage.
          </li>
<li>
           It must then secure customs clearance before loading the goods on the ship. For getting customs clearance, the exporter must submit the necessary documents to the customs appraiser at Customs House.
          </li>
<li>
           After customs clearance, a mate’s receipt will be issued by the captain or commanding officer of the ship to the exporter as evidence that the cargo has been loaded on the ship.
          </li>
<li>
           Later, a bill of lading will have to be obtained from the shipping company as a token of acceptance that the goods have been put on board in its vessel.
          </li>
<li>
           After the goods are shipped, an invoice will have to be prepared by the exporter, which will include the quantity of goods sent and the amount to be paid by the importer.
          </li>
<li>
           The exporter then needs to send a set of documents to the banker, which is to be handed over to the importer on acceptance of a bill of exchange. After receiving the bill of exchange, the importer, Swift Imports, will instruct its bank to transfer money to the exporter’s bank account.
          </li>
<li>
           Last, the exporter would be required to collect a bank certificate of payment, which will state that the necessary documents, along with the bill of exchange, have been presented to the importer for payment, and that the payment has been received in accordance with the exchange control regulations.
          </li>

<strong>
           Question 2. Your firm is planning to import textile machinery from Canada. Describe the procedure involved in importing.
          </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
           Answer:
          </strong>
          In order to import textile machinery from Canada, the firm will have to take the following steps:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           The firm (the importer) should first make an enquiry about the price of the machinery, terms and conditions on which the selected Canadian exporter is willing to supply the goods and such related information. It should then send the trade enquiry to the exporter. On receipt of the trade enquiry, the exporter will prepare a quotation and send it to the importer.
          </li>
<li>
           The importer must find out whether the goods to be imported are subject to import licensing. If needed, it must secure an import license.
          </li>
<li>
           The firm must then convert domestic currency into foreign currency to make payment to the exporter. This is done by submitting an application to a bank in the prescribed form along with documents.
          </li>
<li>
           Once the import license is obtained, the importer can place an order with the exporter specifying the price, quantity and quality of the goods required.
          </li>
<li>
           The importer will be required to send a letter of credit to the Canadian exporter. This letter is obtained from the importer’s bank and acts as a bank guarantee that a draft of a specified amount drawn on it by the exporter will be honoured.
          </li>
<li>
           The next step is for the importer to arrange for finance in order to make payment to the exporter on the arrival of the goods. This is necessary to avoid penalties on account of any delay in payment.
          </li>
<li>
           Once the goods are shipped, the exporter will send a shipment advice to the importer. This document is proof of dispatch of the goods and contains information about the bill of lading, name of the vessel with date, port of export, description of goods, etc.
          </li>
<li>
           The importer must then prepare a bill of exchange that is to be handed over to the exporter’s banker in exchange for the export documents. After this is done, the importer is required to instruct its bank to transfer money to the exporter’s bank account.
          </li>
<li>
           An import general manifest will be issued by the person in charge of the carrier (ship or airliner) in which the goods are being imported. This is done in order to inform the officer in charge at the dock or the airport about the arrival of the goods. This document contains information about the goods being imported, and it is on the basis of this document that unloading of the cargo will take place.
          </li>
<li>
           Once the goods arrive at the port, the importer must get customs clearance, which in turn requires a delivery order, a port duty dues receipt and a bill of entry.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>

          The IMF, or the International Monetary Fund, came into existence in 1945 with the objective of establishing a healthy and orderly monetary system. It aimed at facilitating a system of international payments and taking care of the adjustments in exchange rates among national currencies. It is one of the three international institutions—the other two being the World Bank and the International Trade Organization—that were created for facilitating and monitoring the economic development of the world.

</p>
<ol>
<li>
           It governs trade in goods, services and intellectual property rights among the member countries.
          </li>

<li>
           Reducing tariff and other non-trade barriers imposed by different nations;
          </li>
<li>
           Ensuring sustainable development by optimally using the world resources;
          </li>

<li>
           Resolving trade disputes among member nations;
          </li>
<li>
           Eliminating discriminations in trade relations by laying down a commonly accepted code of conduct;
          </li>

<strong>
           Question 1. Explain the term FOB.
          </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
           Answer:
          </strong>
          Free On Board (FOB) indicates that the supplier pays the shipping costs that include the insurance costs from the point of production to a specified destination, at which point the buyer takes responsibility.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Description:
          </strong>
          The FOB is an important part in a purchase contract. It indicates who selects the carrier, which party is to bear the freight charges and who has the title to the goods during the shipment.
          <br/>
          There are two types of FOB contract.
          <br/>
<strong>
           FOB Destination:
          </strong>
          In FOB destination (the standard and most commonly used) the seller is the owner of goods while in transit and is responsible for any loss or damage up to the time of delivery. It is expressed as FOB Mumbai or FOB Cochin. It could be to negotiate the shipping separately from the purchase of goods or if a party wants all the shipping to be done by a specific carrier.
          <br/>
<strong>
           FOB Origin:
          </strong>
          When no FOB terms are discussed or not mentioned in the contract or purchase order, then, in accordance with the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) the term is FOB Origin. The buyer is then responsible for freight and damaged goods.

<strong>
           Question 2. Write short note on Indent House and Dock Challan.
          </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
           Answer:
          </strong>
          Meaning of Indent House: Import of goods from a foreign country can be affected in two ways. The import of goods can take place directly or through a middleman. The import of goods through an intermediary is called an Indent House. Indent Houses are of two types. They may be representative or agents of foreign producers or exporters or they may be independent firms engaged in foreign trade. At the time of securing order, the indent firm requests the merchant to sign an Indent Form which services as a letter of authority by the merchant to the Indent House to go for order of the specified items stated in the form. The Indent House brings the following advantages:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           It helps the small dealers to participate in foreign trade.
          </li>
<li>
           The bargaining is done by the Indent Forms and therefore helps in getting the goods at a cheaper rate.
          </li>
<li>
           The financing of import trade is facilitated by the Indent House.
          </li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
           Dock Challan:
          </strong>
          When all formalities of customs are completed then dock charges are required to be paid. When he pays these charges, the importer or his clearing agent specifies the amount of dock dues in a challan or in any firm. It is called Dock Challan.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Question 3. Who is a clearing agent?
          </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
           Answer:
          </strong>
          “Clearing and forwarding agent” means any person who is engaged in providing any service, either directly or indirectly, concerned with the clearing and forwarding operations in any manner to any other person and includes a consignment agent.
          <br/>
          A clearing and forwarding agent normally undertakes the following activities:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           Receiving the goods from the factories or premises of the principal or his agents;
          </li>
<li>
           Warehousing these goods;
          </li>
<li>
           Receiving dispatch orders from the principal;
          </li>
<li>
           Arranging dispatch of goods as per the directions of the principal by engaging transport on his own or through the authorised transporters of the principal;

          </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
           Answer:
          </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
            To Earn Foreign Exchange:
           </strong>
           Every country in the world is trying to earn a share in the global trade. This is due to the lowering of trade barriers since the inception of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), increased import bills, and increased global competition in the domestic market. Also, most developing countries row heavily from financial institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other sources to finance their developmental activities and reduce the balance of payment deficits. It is, therefore, imperative that the import bills as well as foreign loans be paid back in foreign exchange. In order to achieve this, earning foreign exchange through various export activities is the need of the hour.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            To Motivate Organisations to Export:
           </strong>
           In order to motivate organisations to export and earn precious foreign exchange, governments offer certain incentives. These incentives help reduce the tax burden of the exporters and also achieve a competitive price-edge for their products in foreign markets. However, being a member of WTO, each country has to ensure that the incentives offered by its government do not give an unfair advantage to the exporters. Thus, no country is to give special trading advantages to another or to discriminate against its all nations stand on an equal basis and share the benefits of any move towards lower trade barriers (branch). Also, all export incentives have to comply with WTO norms and should be in line with its various principles.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            To Promote Interests of Indian Exporters and keeping commitment of WTO:
           </strong>
           In India, the framework of export incentives in the form of duty exemption and remission schemes has been devised keeping in mind the interests of exporters as well as the commitments India has made to WTO.
           <br/>
           The Duty Exemption Scheme helps exporters import duty-free inputs required for manufacturing export products. The Duty Remission Schemes enable post-exports replenishment/remission of duty on inputs.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            To Import Capital Goods:
           </strong>
           In addition to this, the Export Promotion Capital Goods (EPCG) scheme enables exporters to import capital goods at concessional rate of duty and suitable export obligation.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            To Reduce Bureaucratic Hurdles:
           </strong>
           The incentives detailed above are available to all eligible exporters in India. In addition, the government has launched the very ambitious scheme of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in order to reduce bureaucratic hurdles in importing inputs for exports and exporting finished products from India. These SEZs are modelled on the highly successful Chinese Economic Zones. It is expected that the SEZs will be the engines of growth in international trade for India.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            To Correct Unfavourable Balance of Trade:
           </strong>
           During the period of planning, except two years, all other years have witnessed unfavourable balance of trade. It not only reduced the foreign exchange reserves of India but also made it difficult to achieve plan targets. Successful completion of plans, therefore, calls for turning of unfavourable balance of trade into favourable one which requires increase in exports.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            To Reduce Foreign Loans:
           </strong>
           India has to row large foreign funds to import essential machinery for economic and industrial development. Till March 2009, India had contracted foreign loans amounting to ? 11, 42,618 crore. These loans are to be repaid one day. To pay interest and repay the principal amount of these loans, it is necessary that a policy of export promotion be adopted. Foreign exchange earned as a result of larger exports will be utilized for the repayment of foreign loans.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            To Achieve the Objective of Self-Reliance:
           </strong>
           One of the main objectives of Indian
           <br/>
           plans is to make the country independent of foreign assistance. To achieve this objective, it is necessary to promote exports. By accelerating exports, large amount of foreign currency can be earned. ‘
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            To Sell Surplus Production:
           </strong>
           During the period of planning, new industries have been set-up in India. In order to increase the sale of the products of these industries, their export is to be promoted. It becomes easy to increase exports under export promotion program.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            To Finance Imports:
           </strong>
           Successful execution of the plans necessitates import of machines and other capital goods from abroad. To earn necessary foreign exchange to meet their import bills, it becomes necessary to increase exports.
          </li>

<strong>
           Question.5. Explain all the documents used in export procedure.
          </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
           Answer.
          </strong>
          Documents required for an international sale can vary significantly from transaction to transaction, depending on the destination and the product being shipped. At a minimum, there will be two documents: the invoice and the transport document. The buyer will usually provide the seller with a list of documents needed to get the goods into his country as expeditiously and inexpensively as possible. Some documentary requirements are not open to negotiation, as they are needed by the importer to clear customs at the port of destination.
          <br/>
          International market involves various types of trade documents that need to be produced while making transactions. Each trade document is different from other and present the various aspects of the trade like description, quality, number, transportation medium, indemnity, inspection and so on. So, it becomes important for the importers and exporters to make sure that their documents support the guidelines as per international trade transactions. A small mistake could prove costly for any of the parties.
          <br/>
          For example, a Trade Document about the Bill of Lading is a proof that goods have been shipped on board, while Inspection Certificate, certifies that the goods have been inspected and meet quality standards. So, depending on these necessary documents, a seller can assure a buyer that he has fulfilled his responsibility whilst the buyer is assured of his request being carried out by the seller.
          <br/>
          The following is a list of documents often used in international trade:

This is done due to the safety reasons which ensure that the document never comes into the hands of an unauthorised person. Only one original is sufficient to take possession of goods at port of discharge so, a bank which finances a trade transaction will need to control the complete set. The Bill of Lading must be signed by the shipping company or its agent, and must show how many signed originals were issued.
           <br/>

           <br/>
           1. Carry an “On Board” notation to showing the actual date of shipment, (Sometimes however, the “on board” wording is in small print at the bottom of the B/L, in which cases there is no need for a dated “on board” notation to be shown separately with date and signature.)
           <br/>

It was negotiated at the end of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1994. The TRIPS agreement introduced intellectual property law into the international trading system for the first time and remains the most comprehensive international agreement on intellectual property to date. In 2001, developing countries, concerned that developed countries were insisting on an overly narrow reading of TRIPS, initiated a round of talks that resulted in the Doha declaration. The Doha declaration is a WTO statement that clarifies the scope of TRIPS, stating for example that TRIPS can and should be interpreted in light of the goal “to promote access to medicines for all.”

            IV. Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS)
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<strong>
           Question 1. Up-to-date Garments has ordered for export of ready made garments. What steps must be followed by the company to receive the import order?
          </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
           Answer:
          </strong>
          Following steps should be taken by Up-to-date Garments for export of readymade garments:
          <br/>
<strong>
           Step 1 Obtaining Import License and Quota:
          </strong>
          In all countries there are many government regulations to be followed. Sanction of government is necessary. Importer has to apply to the Controller of Imports for getting necessary permission.
          <br/>
          Importer has to attach the following documents to his application form:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Receipt which shows that Import License fee has been paid.
          </li>
<li>
           Certificate from a Chartered Accountant showing the total value of goods to be imported.
          </li>
<li>
           Verification Certificate for Income Tax.
          </li>
<li>
           An Import License may be general or specific. A general license allows imports from any country. But specific license allows imports from specific country only.
          </li>
<li>
           The importer also has to obtain import quota certificate from the concerned authority. It mentions the maximum quantity of goods which can be imported.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
           Step 2 Obtaining Foreign Exchange
          </strong>
          : Before placing any order, the importer must apply to the Exchange Control Department (ECD) of RBI (India’s Central Bank) for the release of requisite foreign exchange. The importer should forward the application through his bank. The ECD verifies the application of the importer, and if found valid, sanctions the foreign exchange for the particular transaction.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Step 3 Placing an Order:
          </strong>
          The importer may either place the order directly or through the indent house (Agent). In case of canalized items, he obtains the imports through the canalizing agency. (Canalisation means channelization of goods through a government agency like MMTC). The importer cannot directly import such canalized items. They have to place an order with the canalizing agency who shall import and supply the same.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Step 4  Dispatching Letter of Credit:
          </strong>
          After getting the confirmation from the supplier regarding the supply of goods, the importer requests his bank to issue a Letter of Credit in favour of supplier. It can be defined as “an undertaking by importer’s bank stating that payment will be made to the exporter if the required documents are presented to the bank”.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Step 5  Appointing Clearing and Forwarding Agents:
          </strong>
          The importer makes arrangement to appoint clearing and forwarding agents to clear the goods from the customs. Since clearing of goods is a specialized job, it is better to appoint C and F agents. ‘
          <br/>
<strong>
           Step 6  Receipt of Shipment Device:
          </strong>
          The importer receives the shipment advice from the exporter. The shipment advice states the date on which the goods are loaded on the ship. The shipment advice helps the importer to make arrangement for clearance of goods.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Step 7  Receipts of Documents:
          </strong>
          The importer’s bank receives the documents from the exporter’s bank. The documents include Bill of Exchange, a copy of Bill of Lading, Certificate of Origin, Commercial Invoice, Consular Invoice, Packing List, and other relevant documents. The importer makes payment to the bank (if not paid earlier) and collects the documents.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Step 8  Bill of Entry:
          </strong>
          This is a document required in case of import of goods. It is like shipping bill in case of exports. Bill of Entry is the document testifying the fact that goods of the stated value and description in specified quantity are entering into the country from abroad. The customs office supplies this form which is prepared in triplicate. Three different colours are used to prepare Bill of Entry. One copy is retained by Custom Department, other is retained by Port Trust and the third is kept by the Importer.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Step 9  Delivery Order:
          </strong>
          The clearing agents obtain the delivery order from the office of the shipping company. The shipping company gives the delivery order only after payment of freight, if any.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Step 10  Clearing of Goods:
          </strong>
          The clearing agent pays the necessary dock or port trust dues and obtains the Port Trust Receipt in two copies.
          <br/>
          He then approaches the Customs House and presents one copy of Port Trust Receipt, and two copies of Bill of Entry to the customs authorities. The Customs Officer endorses the Bill of Entry Forms and one copy of Bill of Entry is handed back to the importer. The importer then pays the customs duty and clears the goods. In case, the customs duty is not paid, then the goods are stored in the bonded warehouses. As and when the duty is paid, the goods are cleared from the docks.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Step 11  Payment to Clearing and Forwarding Agent:
          </strong>
          The importer then makes the necessary payment to the clearing agent for his various expenses and fees.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Step 12   Payment to Exporter:
          </strong>
          The importer has to make payment to exporter. Usually, the exporter draws a bill of exchange. The importer has to accept the bill and make payment.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Step 13  Follow up:
          </strong>
          The importer then informs the exporter about the receipt of goods. If there are any discrepancies or damages to the goods, he should inform the exporter.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Question 2. The process involved in securing payment for exports is very complicated. Do you agree? Explain your answer.
          </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
           Answer:
          </strong>
          Yes, I agree. The process is very complicated and it can be explained by looking at the steps involved in securing payment for exports. Following steps are involved in securing payments for exports:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           Once the goods for export are shipped, the importer is informed about the shipment by the exporter. However, to claim the title of the goods, the importer is required to submit various documents, such as a copy of the Invoice, Bill of Lading, Packaging List, Insurance Policy, Certificate of Origin and Letter of Credit.
          </li>
<li>
           These documents are sent by the exporter and provided by the exporter’s bank only when the Bill of Exchange has been signed and accepted by the importer.
          </li>
<li>
           The Bill of Exchange states the amount that the importer must pay to the bearer of the bill.
           <br/>
           Once the bill is received and accepted, the importer’s bank is instructed by the importer to transfer money to the exporter’s bank account.
          </li>
<li>
           In case the exporter wants immediate payment from his or her bank even if the payment has not been released by the importer, then he or she can secure payment by signing a letter of indemnity. This letter acts as an undertaking that the exporter will indemnify the bank, along with the accrued interest, in case of non-payment by the importer.
          </li>

           Last, when the exporter receives the payment from the bank, he or she obtains a Bank Certificate of Payment. This certificate states that the necessary documents along with the Bill of Exchange have been presented to the importer for payment and that the payment has been received in accordance with the Exchange Control Regulations.

            V. Value Based Questions
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<strong>
           Question 1. Do you think it is the right policy to promote exports at the cost of unfulfilled domestic demand? Justify your answer.
          </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
           Answer:
          </strong>
          No, I do not think it is the right policy to promote exports at the cost of unfulfilled domestic demand. But a country has no choice when its imports bills are too heavy and the goods which are being imported have no domestic substitute like petroleum products in case of India. Government can take following steps in this regard:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           We need to concentrate on making Indian industries more competitive in international market so that export demand for Indian goods increases especially for those which are in surplus in India.
          </li>
<li>
           We need to provide Indian goods in domestic market at such competitive prices so that people are naturally not attracted towards foreign goods because gone are the days when we could stop foreign countries from entering the market through taxes and quota. Now we can stop them only through tough competition.
          </li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
           Question 2. Do you think such a lengthy import and export is a hurdle in foreign trade? Explain.
          </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
           Answer:
          </strong>
          Yes, a lengthy import and export procedure is certainly a hurdle in foreign trade. There are many paper formalities related to shipment, payment, delivery and insurance etc. which are legally compulsory and some are practically unavoidable. It demotivates a business man to engage in import and export trade.
          <br/>
          No doubt, fast modes of communication and transportation have reduced the hurdles but it is much more difficult than domestic trade still. Therefore, simplifying procedures can really promote international trade leaps and bounds.
