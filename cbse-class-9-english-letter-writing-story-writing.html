          A story writing is an art that requires a lot of communication skills. First of all it requires the art of narrating things in an interesting way. You will be given either the introductory lines or some hints given in the input or both. You have to develop the story basing it on the information given in the input or the introductory lines. You have to develop it on the same theme as intended by the introductory lines or by the input. You can’t go against the stated theme.

           SALIENT FEATURES OF A GOOD STORY
          </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
           Basically, developing and writing a good story needs the art of narration. You have to narrate the incidents in a sequential order leading to the final conclusion.
          </li>
<li>
           Students should follow the basic theme as expounded by the input or by the introductory lines. They are not supposed to invent new and different themes.
          </li>
<li>
           Within the given limits, students are left with enough space where they can give expression to their creative talents.
          </li>
<li>
           The beginning and the concluding lines must support the main part or the events described in the story.
          </li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
           * As per the CBSE syllabus, you are required to write a story in about 150-200 words.

          Veeru and Karim were young Keralites. The next week their school was going to organise a camp near a forest in Ponmuddy. The following week they joined the camp. One day they went out together. They thought of going inside the forest to explore it. Soon they lost their way. The sun had set. They were walking along the Periyar river. They heard a loud noise. They stood still and listened to it. They heard the sound of an animal coming towards them. It was the sound of a big elephant. He was just fifty metres away from them. The elephant smelled them too. He saw them standing quietly behind an oak tree. He raised his long trunk up in the air and trumpted loudly. The boys didn’t move. Veeru was a little frightened, but Karim was not. Slowly the elephant started coming nearer and nearer. Now he was only ten metres away. “Let’s do something,” said Karim. “Do it, before he attacks us,” said Veeru.
          <br/>
          Karim pulled out a balloon from his pocket. He put it in his mouth and started blowing into the balloon. At last, it was blown to the size of a small bag. Karim hit the full blown balloon hard with his hand. “Bang-Bang!” The elephant stopped and trumpeted angrily. He was confused.The elephant turned away and disappeared into the forest. The boys ran and ran till they reached safe at the camp.

          Mr. Aggarwal was a very wealthy businessman. One day he was alone sitting at his dining table. It was his birthday. He heard the footsteps of a man behind the curtains. He knew there was a thief there. “Come on! Thank you for coming to my house on my birthday. I’m alone,give me your company.” The thief was starving. He had good food and drinks. Mr. Aggarwal gave him a big purse. It had silver coins. Years rolled by. His fortunes changed. Mr. Aggarwal ,was a very poor man now. His business was ruined.
          <br/>
          Today was his 50th birthday. But he had become a pauper now. He was alone reflecting over his good old days. It was 9 pm. The bell rang. “Who can be at such a time to visit a poor man?” thought Aggarwal. He saw a man in a new suit with a lovely bouquet of red roses. He had many packets of gifts, fruits, sweets and a few bottles. He tried to recognise the man. “I’m your old thief,” replied the man. With the money you gave me I did some business. I earned a lot of money within these years. Now I am a rich businessman. “Let’s celebrate your birthday,” he said. “It is for you, a little return-gift.” He gave a bag to Mr. Aggarwal. Mr. Aggarwal opened the bag. It was full of new currency notes.

          A woodcutter was chopping down trees on the bank of a river. His hands were so much wet with his sweat that he lost his grip over the axe. It slipped away from his hands and fell down ;     into the river. The poor man couldn’t even swim. He thought that his axe was lost forever. He was very sad at his misfortune and started sobbing and weeping. Suddenly there was a flash of light. The god of the Forests appeared before him. The woodcutter explained what had happened. The god consoled him, “Don’t you worry. I’ll get back your axe for you.” Having said these words, he dived into the river. After a few moments he came out with an axe. It was made of gold. “Is this yours?” he asked. The woodcutter only said “No!” A few seconds later he came out of the river with another axe. It was made of silver. “No, no, sir, this is not mine,” said the woodcutter. He dived again and came out with the third axe. The woodcutter cried loudly looking at the axe “Yes, yes, it’s mine—the woodcutter’s axe with an iron blade.” The god of Forests was impressed with the woodcutter’s honesty. “Keep all three of these axes as a present from me.” The god uttered these words and disappeared.

<p>
          The celebrated archer Guru Dronacharya taught the royal princes the finer points of archery. One day he wanted to test the archery skill of his pupils. They came to a forest. The Guru chose a tree standing in the open. He placed a wooden bird on a bare branch of that tree. The princes were asked to stand 200 yards away and aim at their target one by one. They were to hit the eye of the bird. Yudhisthir was asked to start the competition. He took his bow and looked at his target. “Can you see me?” asked Dronacharya. “Yes sir!” replied Yudhisthir. “Put down your bow,” asked the Guru. The disappointed prince retired from the contest. The same thing happened with all other princes. The same question was asked and all of them gave the same reply. Hence, all of them were asked to retire from the competition.
          <br/>
          Finally, it was Arjuna’s turn. “Arjuna do you see me?” asked the Guru. “I see nothing but only my target, the eye of the bird,” replied Aijuna. “Good, Aijuna, shoot now,” asked Dronacharya. Aijuna released the arrow aiming at his target. The arrow hit the eye of the wooden bird. And finally, Aijuna was adjudged as the most accomplished marksman.

          Next morning all the four gathered at Raj’s house. Raghu told his servant, “Run back to my house and find out if I am there or not.” Without wasting even for a second, Ramu rushed home. Then Raj called his servant Shammu and said, “Hurry up! Go to your room and find out if you are there or not.” Without even thinking for a moment, Shammu ran to his room. After some time they returned. Both of them were annoyed with their masters. Ramu complained, “Why did you waste your time? You could have phoned to find out whether you were there or not.” Shammu expressed his displeasure in these words: “Why didn’t you tell me before? I would not have come out of my room.” He reported that he was not found in the room. Raghu and Raj heaved a sigh. There was really nothing to choose between the two fools. Only God could decide who was the lesser fool?

           A Grain as Big as a Hen’s Egg
           <br/>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
          One day some children found a thing shaped like a grain of com. A traveller bought it from the children for a penny and sold it to the king. The king called together his wisemen, and told them to find out what the thing was. The wisemen told him that it was a grain of com. The king ordered the wisemen to find out when and where such com had grown. The wisemen presented an old farmer. He was pale, toothless and walked on crutches. The old man saw the grain. He told the king that he never sowed or reaped any grain like it in the fields. Perhaps his father could tell him, something about it. The king sent for the old farmer’s father. He was shown the grain but he also didn’t know anything where a com like that grew. He told that perhaps his father would tell something about the grain. The old man’s father was called. He could walk easily and without crutches and spoke clearly. The old grandfather looked at the grain. He told that people used to grow grain like that everywhere long time ago. “Did you buy it or grow it all yourself?” asked the king. The grand old man told that in his time it was a sin to buy or sell land. They knew nothing of money. Each man had com enough of his own. Their fields were God’s earth. Land was free. Labour was the only thing men called their own. The king asked why his grandson walked with two crutches and your son with one. He needed no cmtches, his teeth were sound, speech clear and hearing perfect. The grand old man answered that his grandson and son made themselves miserable as men had ceased to live by their own labour. They were miserable as they started depending on the labour of others. In the old times men lived according to God’s law and had only what was their own.

          Alyosha was tiny, thin fellow with ears like wings and a huge nose. At twelve he began to plough and drive the cart. He was weak but cheerful. His father placed him with a merchant. He did everything quickly and readily. He forgot nothing and found time for everything. He would get up before daybreak, chop the wood, sweep the yard, feed cows and horses and cooked. Alyosha never set eyes on his wages. His father used to take his wages from the merchant leaving nothing for him. Towards the end of the second year the most startling thing happened to him. He felt for the first time in his life that he too was important for some human being. The cook Ustinia would sit watching him and it worried Alyosha. He feared that it might interfere with his work. She told him all about her life. She was ready to marry him. Alyosha’s father came to the merchant to collect his son’s wages. He came to know from the merchant’s wife that Alyosha wanted to marry Ustinia. Both the merchant and his wife told him that they didn’t want and approve of married servants. They would not keep them in the house. His father told Alyosha that he couldn’t marry Ustinia. Alyosha consented. From that day Alyosha went to his work as usual. One day he fell down from the roof and hurt himself. He was taken to the lodge, and the doctor examined him. He was about to die. A priest was called. “Are you going to die?” asked Ustinia. “Of course, I am.” He thanked Ustinia for being so good to him. They were lucky that they didn’t marry. He lay in wonderment, then stretched himself and died.

          There lived in the olden times a noble and generous man. The slaves prided themselves on their master. They considered him the best master under the sun as he fed and clothed them well. The Devil was vexed to hear such words of praise for the master. He got one of the slaves Aleb on his side. He asked Aleb to incite other slaves against their master. Aleb did the mischief. He tried to prove that their master was good because they were good to him. He would repay evil for evil and act differently in such a situation. The other slaves opposed Aleb. Aleb pledged to make the master angry. The master was walking around his enclosure showing his guests his eves and lambs. He had special praise for a twisted homed ram. He considered it priceless. Aleb rushed like a lion among the sheep. He seized the left hind leg of the ram and just before his master’s eyes snapped it like a dry branch. The ram’s leg was broken. The visitors and the slaves cried in dismay. The devil was sitting up in a tree. He was happy that Aleb had done his job rather very cleverly. The master raised his eyes heavenward. He looked down at Aleb with a smile saying: “Oh, Aleb, Aleb! Your master bade you anger me but my master is stronger than yours. I am not angry with you, but I will make your master angry.” He set Aleb free. The kind master returned with his guests to the house. The devil, grinding his teeth, fell down from the tree.

<p>
          There lived in Vladimir, a young merchant Aksyonof. One summer he was going to the Nizhny Fair. When he had travelled half-way, he met a merchant whom he knew quite well. They stayed at the same inn and went to bed in an adjoining room. The next morning, Aksyonof continued his journey. Two soldiers and an officer stopped him on the way. Aksyonof was searched and a blood-stained knife was recovered from his bag. He was arrested for killing and looting his fellow merchant in the inn. Aksyonof pleaded innocence. He was charged with the murder and robbing the merchant of 20,000 roubles. For twenty six-years Aksyonof lived as a convict in Siberia. His hair turned white and his beard grew long, thin and grey. No news reached from his home’ and Aksyonof didn’t know if his wife and children were alive or not. One of the new convicts was from Aksyonof’s town Vladimir. He was Makar. He told that Aksyonofs were rich but their mother was dead and father was in Siberia. Aksyonof asked Makar if he had heard who killed the merchant. He replied that the man in whose bag the knife was found must be the murderer. He asked, “How could anyone put a knife into your bag while it was under your head”? Aksyonof felt sure that Makar was the man who had killed the merchant. One night Makar came to Aksyonof’s room and told him that he had dug a tunnel under the wall and Aksyonof could go out of the prison. The next day, the soldiers found the tunnel. They asked Aksyonof who dug the tunnel. “It is not God’s will that I should tell!” told Aksyonof.
          <br/>
          That night Makar came to Aksyonof and confessed that it was he who had killed the merchant and hid the knife in his bag. He wept bitterly and asked for forgiveness. He would confess and Aksyonof could be released. “Where could I go now?……. My wife is dead, and my children have forgotten me. I have nowhere to go.” Makar confessed his guilt. But when the order for Aksyonof’s release came, he was already dead.

           Where there is Love, There is God
           <br/>

</p>
<p>
          In a certain town there lived a cobbler named Martin. He could recognise the people by their boots. His only son died young and Martin didn’t wish to live any more. One day a noble man reasoned with Martin. He told him that they could not judge God’s ways. God gives him life and he must live for him. Martin fell asleep. Suddenly he heard a voice. “Martin! Look out into the street tomorrow, for I shall come.” Next morning, he saw an old man standing near his window. He was shivering in cold. “Come in and warm yourself a bit.” He asked him to sit down and have some tea. While the old man drank his tea, Martin kept looking out into the street. He told that he was expecting the Lord Himself. The old man thanked Martin for his hospitality and went away. No one came. When Martin was anxious, he saw a poor woman standing near the window with a crying baby in her arms. “Why do you stand out there with the baby in the cold?” Martin led her to the bed near the stove. The woman was hungry. He gave some bread and cabbage soup to her. She had no warm clothing as she had pawned her last shawl for six pence yesterday. Martin gave her six pence to get her shawl out of pawn. After the woman had gone, his eyes were still fixed at the window. And a voice whispered in his ear. “Martin, Martin, don’t you know me?” Martin looked around in surprise. And out of the dark comer stopped the old man, “It is I.” Then the figure disappeared. “It is I,” said the voice once more. And now the woman with the baby laughed and they too vanished. Martin crossed himself. He understood that his dream had come true. And the Lord had really come to him that day, and he had welcomed him.

<strong>
           The False Diamonds
           <br/>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
          There lived a rich man in Varanasi. He had only one son who had just turned ten. He had a lot of land and property. He wanted to find out a good adviser for his son before his death. The man must be true and honest. This was what the rich man had thought. One day he invited all his relatives to a grand feast. He asked each of them if he was a wise and good man. Every relative called himself the “wisest and best” man in the world. “Ah!” exclaimed the rich man. He gave a diamond to each of his relatives. But one relative remained silent. The rich man asked what he thought of him as a man. The relative replied, “You are a wise and good man but there have been wiser and better men than you”.
          <br/>
          This time the rich man gave a smile of satisfaction. He gave him a diamond as big as an almond. He had found the kind of man he wanted. He appointed him his son’s adviser. The next day other relatives came. They complained that the diamonds given to them yesterday were not real. “Yes, they were as false as your words,” said the rich man.

<strong>
           The King for Three Hours
           <br/>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
          Humayun was the king of India. Sher Shah, an Afghan chief and his bitter enemy, gave him no peace. Sher Shah’s army attacked the Mughal soldiers at night. Humayun escaped. He decided to cross the river on horse back. He fell into the river and struggled for life. A water-carrier was on the bank. He realised that Humayun’s life was in danger. He jumped into the river with his water bag. The bag was full of air and floated on the water. He put Humayun on the water bag and brought him safely out of the river.
          <br/>
          Humayun was grateful. The water-carrier had saved his life. “Tell me, what can I do for you?” asked the king. “Your Majesty, make me king for three hours,” said the water-carrier. “Let it be so,” said Humayun. The king reached Delhi. “Tomorrow, for three hours, you will be the king,” said the king. The water-carrier sat on Humayun’s throne. He ordered the courtiers, “Make coins from my water-bag.” They cut small round pieces of leather from the water-bag. The name of the water-carrier was stamped on it. And the people used those leather coins for three hours!

They tried every medicine. Even doctors from India and China were called. But the prince did not get well. On the other hand, Zubaid’s condition became still worse. The king had no other child to sit on the throne after his death. He cursed himself and his stars. He gave alms to the poor. But that too made no difference. Zubaid showed no sign of improvement. The king was heart broken. He was convinced that the prince would die sooner or later.

          At last, the king had lost all hope. He came to his sick son. He looked at his weak and lifeless face for the last time. He stood up and walked round the prince’s bed for seven times. Every time he prayed, “Allah! save my son. Take jny life instead.” Then a miracle took place. Zubaid started showing signs of improvement. On the other hand, Darius fell ill. The prince was on the road to recovery but the king was nearing death. One day Zubaid got well and came out of the sickman’s bed. The moment he got up, Darius fell down dead never to rise again.

<strong>
           Wisdom Saves
           <br/>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
          Once a wise monkey lived on a big mango tree on a river bank. Very near lived a crocodile in the river. They became intimate friends. Quite often the monkey gave ripe mangoes to his friend.One day the crocodile demanded some mangoes for his wife. She had never tasted mangoes in her life. The generous monkey picked a big ripe mango and gave it to the crocodile.
          <br/>
          The crocodile’s wife liked the delicious mango very much. She was very cunning and wicked.She thought of eating the monkey itself. “One who eats such sweet mangoes, his heart must be very sweet,” said she. The poor crocodile was upset. He told his wife clearly that he would never allow to get such a friend killed. But the wicked wife made the crocodile’s life really miserable. At last, he gave in. The next day he went to the mango tree. He invited the monkey to have lunch with them. He took the monkey on his back. When they were in the middle of the river, the crocodile revealed the truth. His wife actually wanted to eat his heart. The wise monkey was quiet for a moment. Then he hit upon a plan. He said, “I’ve left my heart hanging on the mango tree. I want to go back and bring it.” Soon they were under the tree. The monkey lost no time in climbing up on the topmost branch. He pointed to his heart and said, “My heart is inside me. Go away and never come near the mango tree again. It’s the end of our friendship.”

          The boat capsized but I managed to survive. I walked on and on till I could walk no more. I was completely exhausted. I collapsed on the short, soft grass and fell into a deep sleep. It was daylight now. I woke up. I tried to get up but couldn’t stand. I found my arms and legs tied down to the ground with strings. I found myself in a hopeless and helpless situation.
          <br/>
          I could hear noises around me. They were faint human voices. Then I felt something moving on my body. It came near my face. He was a tiny little man of 3 inches. He was dressed like a soldier. Forty more followed him. I was amazed to see such tiny men. I couldn’t understand what they wanted to do with me. Then I felt as if a thousand needles were pricking my body.The little men were shooting arrows at me. Then I lay still without moving. One of the elders, perhaps their leader, stood on a raised platform near me. I indicated for food and water. He seemed to understand me. He sent hundreds of men up to my face. I had my dinner. After the generous dinner, I went to sleep again. This was my first day among Lilliputians.

<strong>
           The Story of the Fisherman
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          There was a poor fisherman. It was his custom to cast his net not more than four times a day. One day when he cast his net soon he found it to be very heavy. He pulled up the net but was disappointed to find in it the carcass of an ass. He cast the net second time and this time he found only a large jar full of sand and mud. The third time he got only broken jars and pots. He raised his head towards heaven, and said, “O God, Thou knowest that I cast not my net more than four times.” With the name of God he cast the net for the last time. This time he found in it a bottle of brass with a stopper of lead, bearing the seal of Suleman. He was rejoiced as he could sell it for ten pieces of gold. He shook the bottle and opened it. Nothing came out of it except a cloud of smoke which was condensed into a Jinn. The Jinn threatened to kill him. The fisherman told the Jinn that he had liberated him from the bottle and rescued from the bottom of the sea. The Jinn was unrelenting. The fisherman then said, “How was Thou in this bottle? How can it contain the whole body?” He said that he would never believe it until he saw in it. Upon this the Jinn was converted into smoke and then became condensed and entered the bottle little by little. The fisherman hastily sealed the bottle. The Jinn tried to escape but in vain. “Open to me, I may confer benefits upon thee,” said the Jinn. The fisherman replied, “Thou liest, thou accursed!” And he threw the bottle back deep into the sea.

           The Story of the Merchant and the Jinn
           <br/>

</p>
<p>
          There lived a merchant in Basra. He had great wealth and traded extensively. One day he was mounting on his horse journeying to a neighbouring country to collect his due. When he felt hungry, he ate a morsel of bread and a date. Having eaten the date, he threw aside the stone.
          <br/>
          Immediately appeared before him a Jinn holding a drawn sword in his hand. He threatened to kill the merchant, as the stone of the date killed his son. The merchant pleaded that he didn’t do it intentionally and he should be pardoned. The Jinn replied that his death was indispensable. Saying this he raised his arm to strike him with the sword. The merchant wept bitterly. Then the merchant said that he had debts to pay, property to settle and say good bye to his wife and children. He bound himself with a vow that he would return to him and he could do what he wanted to do with him. The merchant returned to his town, paid every one what he owed him and informed his wife and children of the event. On hearing this, all members of the family wept. Ultimately, the merchant presented himself before the Jinn. The Jinn was impressed with his honesty and sincerity. He spared the life of the merchant and liberated him. The Jinn also gave a lot of gold and jewels to him in the bargain.

           The Story of the Hunchback
           <br/>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
          In ancient times there lived a tailor in Baghdad. When he was returning home, he met a hunchbacked man. His aspect was such as to excite laughter even in the angry and dispel grief. The tailor invited the hunchback to his house to enjoy the pleasure of gazing at him. The tailor’s wife served him a large piece of fish and asked him to swallow it once. The hunchback swallowed it. It got stuck in his throat and he died at once. They took the dead body to the house of a physician who was a Jew. They set the dead man up against the wall and went out. The physician came out to see the sick man in haste. In the dark, his foot struck against the lifeless hunchback. He thought that his foot made him fall down the stairs and die. He was frightened. He wanted to dispose of dead body. He went to the terrace and threw the dead hunchback into the house of his Muslim neighbour. When the Muslim steward went up, he saw a man standing in the comer. He took him for a thief and struck him with a great mallet. The dead body of the hunchback fell down and the steward found him dead. The Muslim steward took the dead body to the market place and placed it by the side of a shop and retired. Soon after there came a Christian clerk.in a state of intoxication. So when he saw the hunchback standing there, he concluded that he intended to harm him. He struck him on the neck and attempted to throttle him. As he was doing it, the watchman came. He bound his hands behind him and took him to the chief police magistrate. “Why did you kill him?” said the magistrate. He was sentenced to death. The executioner threw his rope round the neck of the Christian. When he was to hang him, the Muslim steward came running. He confessed that it was he who had killed the hunchback. The executioner put the rope around the neck of the Muslim steward. Then came running the Jewish physician. He confessed that it was he who killed the hunchback. The rope was put around the neck of the Jewish physician. He was about to be hanged when the tailor came and pleaded guilty. He requested to liberate the Jew. The matter was reported to the king. He was surprised that such true and honest persons were still alive in his kingdom. They would not let others die for their sins. He was pleased and granted freedom to all.

<p>
          In Baghdad, there lived a man called Sindibad, the Porter. He was a poor man who bore burdens for hire upon his head. One day the heat was oppressive. The porter put down his burden outside a palatial house. He thought about the rich. They were free from worries and wretchedness. He started singing. When he was about to stand up and depart, a young servant came to him. He told the porter that the master had called for him. He entered the grand mansion and saw noblemen and great lords sitting there. There were all kinds of flowers and scents, wines and varieties of fresh and dried fruits. A lot of music and beautiful slave girls made the place a portion of Paradise. The porter saluted the assembly and stood hanging down his head in humility. The master of the house gave him the permission to sit beside him. He asked his name and trade. He answered that he was Sindibad, the Porter and bore upon his head men’s burden for hire. The master smiled and told him that his name was like him. He was called Sindibad of the sea. He told that he attained so much wealth, respect and fame not all of a sudden. He struggled hard and performed seven voyages and attained that prosperity. He desired to let him hear the verses that he sang while he stood at the gate. The porter recited those verses to him and they pleased Sindibad of the Sea. He employed Sindibad, the Porter as his personal assistant giving him and his family a big furnished house with lots of conveniences.

<strong>
           The First Voyage of Da’ud
           <br/>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
          Da’ud had inherited a lot of wealth and property from his wealthy father. But the life of ease and comforts made him a spendthrift. He soon found that his wealth had passed away. Then he returned to his region and collected what he had. He sold his buildings and land and amassed three thousand pieces of silver. He bought for himself goods and commodities and other things required for performing a sea-voyage. He came to the city of Basra with his fellow merchants. They had passed by island after island and from sea to sea selling, buying and exchanging merchandises. They cast the anchor near an island and gave to eating and drinking. The master of the ship signalled an alarm bell. He announced that the ship had anchored on a huge fish stationed in the midst of the sea. Many hastened to go up into the ship. Da’ud was among those who remained behind the island. But God saved him from drowning as he swam across with the help of a wooden plank. He threw himself upon the island like one dead and soon became unconscious. The island had fruits in abundance and sweet water. Therefore, his health and spirit revived. He spent a few months, grew a beard and his face bore a different resemblance. One day when he was walking upon the shore of the island, he saw an indistinct object in the distance. Suddenly a great ship approached and anchored near the shore. The captain saw Da’ud but didn’t recognise him. He told him that there were some goods in the hold of the ship. Their owner was drowned in the sea at one of the islands during their voyage there. He also told Da’ud that they desired to sell those things and give the money to his family in Baghdad. Da’ud had already recognised the captain and said, “O master, I am the owner of the goods, and I am Da’ud”. The captain welcomed him aboard the ship. Da’ud proceeded to have a reunion with his wife and children. He got a lot of money after selling the merchandise in Baghdad.

            <br/>
</strong>
</span>
          Once a woodcutter lived in a village with his wife and children. He was poor, no doubt, but honest and truthful. Each day, he would go to the forest with his axe to cut trees for wood. One day while he was felling a tree at the bank of river, his axe slipped out of his hand and fell into the water below. The poor woodcutter began to weep in extreme frustration. God Mercury heard his cries. He appeared before him and asked him why he was weeping. The woodcutter told him the whole story. God said, “Don’t worry, I’ll get back your axe”. The very next moment he took off his clothes and dived into the river. After a while, He came out of the water with a golden axe. The woodcutter said, “This axe is made of gold. It is not mine”. Then the God dived into the river again and came out of the water with an axe made of silver. The woodcutter said, “This isn’t mine. Mine is an ordinary iron axe”.God dived into the water the third time. After a few minutes he came out with an iron axe. The woodcutter jumped up with joy on seeing the axe and cried, “This is mine! This is mine! Thank you very much! God was pleased with the honesty of the woodcutter. He gave all the three axes to him as a reward for his truthfulness.”
