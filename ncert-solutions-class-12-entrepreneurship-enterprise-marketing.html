<li>
<strong>
            The moment we focus on a goal,

<strong>
            Question 1. Explain in detail any three pricing strategies.
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<strong>
<span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer.
           </span>
</strong>
          Following are the various pricing strategies:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
            Variable pricing technique:
           </strong>
<br/>
           Variable pricing technique is the one in which different prices are charged from different categories of customers. There is price discrimination. Many factors are responsible for the variation in the price. If a customer is purchasing more quantity of the product, he will be offered lower price. If the demand for the product increases in the market then higher price can be charged. This method has both the objectives viz. selling more quality and also charging higher price but at , different times, e.g. Indian railways charges different fares for AC 3 tier,AC 2 tier, second class and general
           <br/>
           compartment.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Base pricing and discount:
           </strong>
           Base pricing and discount method is the method in which the entrepreneur fixes one price for its commodity. This price is calculated in advance considering the point that discount will be offered during the sale. Here, the discount offered is of various types. Depending on the type of customers the various rates of discount are fixed. Discount is offered to all the customers but at different rates. The wholesaler discount may be different from, volume discount, discount for transaction and off¬season discount.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Skimming pricing method:
           </strong>
<br/>
           Skimming price method is the method of pricing in which the product is introduced in the market with a very high price. High price is kept for recovering the cost of production quickly. Such entrepreneurs normally bring something new in the market with more utility value. Product is introduced with a lot of expenditure on advertisement. High price tends to bring back revenue quickly. High class people are the target of such method of pricing e.g. Philips introduces its new product with the same method, Rumalaya also follows the same trend.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Cost plus pricing method:
           </strong>
           In this method the cost of production of one unit of the product is calculated. This cost covers all the types of costs including explicit cost, variable cost, fixed cost, etc. to this is now added the preplanned profit margin.
           <br/>
           This method of pricing is very simple method. It can easily be used for determining the price. Any changes in the cost of production or the margin of profit change the price in the same direction. It automatically gets adjusted to the change. Profit margin is not to be calculated. It is already fixed. Thus, by multiplying the profit per unit with the volume of the product, the total profit can be determined. Any upward rise in cost is easily visible. This provides an idea to the entrepreneur to adjust his production for keeping the cost as low as possible. Comparatively less calculations are involved, which makes the implementation of this method simple. This method can easily be implemented because of its simplicity to understand and easy calculations.

<strong>
            Question 2. Explain the important factors affecting the choice of channels of distribution by the manufacturer.
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<strong>
<span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer.
           </span>
</strong>
          While selecting a distribution channel, the entrepreneur should take into account the following factors:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
            Considerations related to product:
           </strong>
           It includes the following:
           <br/>
           (a) Unit value of the product: When the product is very costly distribution channel is preferred. For example, industrial machinery or gold ornaments. On the other hand, for less costly products long distribution channel is used.
           <br/>
           (b) Standardised or customised product: Such products have pre-determined cost and there is no scope for alteration. For example: Utensils of MILTON, for these long distribution channel is used.
           <br/>
           On the other hand, customised products are those which are made according to the discretion of the consumer and also there is a scope for alteration, for example; furniture. For such products face-to-face interaction between the manufacturer and the consumer is essential. So for these direct sales is a good option.
           <br/>
           (c) Perishability: Highly perishable goods should have short channel. On the contrary, a long distribution channel can be selected for durable goods.
           <br/>
           (d) Technical nature: If a product is of technical nature, direct channel should be preferred. This will help the user to know the necessary technicalities of the product.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Considerations related to market:
           </strong>
<br/>
           (a) Number of buyers: If the number of buyers is large then it is better to take indirect and long channel of distribution. On the contrary, the distribution should be done by the manufacturer directly if the number of buyers is less.
           <br/>
           (b) Types of buyers: If the more buyers belong to general category then there can be more middlemen. But in case of industrial buyers there should be fewer middlemen.
           <br/>
           (c) Buying habits: Manufacturer can take the services of middlemen if financial position does not permit to sell goods on credit to those consumers who are in the habit of purchasing goods on credit.
           <br/>
           (d) Buying quantity: If the goods are bought in smaller quantity then middlemen can be employed.
           <br/>
           (e) Size of market: If the market area of the product is scattered then the producer must take the help of middlemen, i.e., long channel.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Considerations related to manufacturer/company:
           </strong>
<br/>
           (a) Goodwill: Good reputation need not depend on the middlemen as the firm can open his own branches easily.
           <br/>
           (b) Desire to control the channel of distribution: A manufacturer’s ambition to control the channel of distribution affects its selection. Consumers should be approached directly by such type of manufacturer. For example, electronic goods sector with a motive to control the service levels provided to the customers at the point of sale are resorting to company owned retail counters.
           <br/>
           (c) Financial strength: A strong financial base of a company can have its own channels. On the other hand, financially weak companies would have to depend upon middlemen.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Considerations related to government:
           </strong>
           Only a license holder can sell medicines in the market according to the law of the government. In this situation, the manufacturer should take sell through middlemen who have the relevant license.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Others:
           </strong>
<br/>
           (a) Cost: A manufacturer should select such a channel of distribution which is less costly and also useful from other angles.
           <br/>
           (b) Availability: Other channel of distribution can be selected if the desired channel is not available.
           <br/>
           (c) Possibilities of sales: Such a channel which has a possibility of large sale should be given weight age.

            Question 6. Explain the methods of negotiation.
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<strong>
<span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer.
           </span>
</strong>
<strong>
           Methods of negotiation are as follows:
          </strong>
          Integrative or win-win: Here each side is working towards a solution where everyone wins something. They can make trade offs and look at multiple issues. The involved parties may try to expand the pie rather than divide it. This method fosters trust and good working relationships.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Distributive or win-lose:
          </strong>
          Here one party gets what it wants, and the other party has to give something up. This type of negotiation does not lead to lasting or positive relationships. Here one party remains unsatisfied and so it does not lead to a healthy relationship. Inductive: This method involves starting on small details and working upward until a settlement is reached. Here the solution is sought from the grass root level by understanding each and every minute detail. For example, an employer and labour union are negotiating the details of an employee pension and investment plan. Small details are addressed one at a time.
          <strong>
           Deductive:
          </strong>
          Deductive negotiations start with an agreed upon strategy. They rely on established principles and a formula to frame the negotiation while the parties work out the details. Here each parties is the gainer and jointly the result is met. It is based on the mutual agreement.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Mixed:
          </strong>
          Mixed negotiations are the most common, they are a blend of inductive and deductive methods.

Encouraged with the success of these shops Satnam opened 50 more shops in different parts of Punjab.

</span>
<br/>
<strong>
<span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer.
           </span>
</strong>
          Following are the reasons of business failures:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
            Lack of industry experience:
           </strong>
           The internal resources of a firm has to match the needs of the environment to which the firm belongs. Lack of experience in the field will lead to poor organization of a firm and resources. This may lead to loss and business failure.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Inadequate financing:
           </strong>
           Financing is the lifeblood of a business at every stage. Many businesses fail due to lack of proper financing channels. The lack of planning for funding to support opportunities for growth is the root cause of failure. Planning in advance, rather than looking for financing just when needed, is a good practice. It includes lack of sufficient awareness of the costs involved in raising capital, lack of alternative sources in case of rejection from financiers, etc.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Lack of adequate cash flow:
           </strong>
           Cash flow is the measure of a firm’s ability to maintain sufficient funding to meet its expenses for the day-to-day activities of the business. Many businesses fail because owners have a difficult time projecting what cash will come in every month, and thus, how much can be produced. Cash flow projections and its knowledge will help owners to understand how much they can afford to spend.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Poor business planning:
           </strong>
           Ninety per cent of business failures are caused by a lack of general business management skills and planning. Owner, manager must have sufficient knowledge of such skills. This will lead to proper understanding of the practical situation which can then be resolved using basic management skills.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Management incompetence:
           </strong>
           Ninety per cent of business failures are associated with “management inadequacy”, which can be due to either management inexperience or incompetence. A good strategic plan is only good as the management’s ability to implement changes in day- to-day operations.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Ignoring the competition:
           </strong>
           Customers always looking for the better deal. If competition offers better products, services, or prices, the customers will succeed at the expense of the business. So keeping an eye on competitors and positioning the products accordingly is vital to staying in business.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Unworkable goals:
           </strong>
           Setting goals is one thing and setting workable goals is another. Enterprises are influenced by uncertainty. Setting realistic goals, within the bounds of acceptable risk taking and optimism, is important.
          </li>
<li>
           Diminished customer base
          </li>
<li>
           Uncontrolled growth
          </li>
<li>
           Inappropriate location
          </li>
<li>
           Poor system of control
          </li>
<li>
           Lack of entrepreneurial skills.

</span>
<br/>
<strong>
<span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer.
           </span>
</strong>
          I can go for following promotional strategies:
          <br/>
<strong>
           Contests:
          </strong>
          It is commonly used promotional strategy. Many contests don’t even require a purchase. This will be done as people like to win prizes.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Mail Order Marketing:
          </strong>
          Customers who come into our business are not to be overlooked, such customers have already decided to purchase the product. These are customers who are already familiar with the product and represent the target audience.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Product Giveaways:
          </strong>
          Product giveaways and allowing potential customers to sample produce. This method will be used to introduce new food and household products.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Point-of-Sale Promotion:
          </strong>
          Point-of- sale is a way to promote new products or products a store needs to move. These items are placed near the checkout in the store and are often purchased by consumers on impulse as they wait to be checked out.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Branded Promotional Gifts:
          </strong>
          Giving away functional branded gifts can be a more effective promotional move than handing out simple business cards. These are gifts we can give to customers that they may use, which keeps our business in plain sight rather than in the trash.
          <br/>
<strong>
           After-Sale Customer Surveys:
          </strong>
          Contacting customers by telephone or through the mail after a sale is a promotional strategy that puts the importance of customer satisfaction first while leaving the door open for a promotional opportunity.

</span>
<br/>
<strong>
<span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer.
           </span>
</strong>
          The rules of goal setting are:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
            Relevant:
           </strong>
           To be relevant, a business goal has to be profitable in some fashion. Every business goal has to be measurable in rupees, and must possess a clear advantage to the specific business.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Actionable:
           </strong>
           When we’re setting business goals, we have to be sure that we have developed them from general statements. Goals without action plans are just pretty words.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Achievable stretches:
           </strong>
           The purpose of business goals is to move the businesses forward. If expectations are set too high, we set up for failure and disappointment. If the expectations are set too low then we won’t get enough satisfaction or recognition from the accomplishment.
           <br/>
           A goal has to stretch us to be worth doing.

           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<strong>

<strong>
<span style="color: #008000;">

</strong>
          Variable pricing technique is the one in which different prices are charged from different categories of customers. There is price discrimination. Many factors are responsible for the variation in the price. If a customer is purchasing more quantity of the product, he will be offered lower price. If the demand for the product increases in the market then higher price can be charged. This method has both the objectives viz. selling more quality and also charging higher price but at different times, e.g. Indian railways charges different fares for AC 3 tier, AC 2 tier, second class and general compartment.

            Question 11. What is penetrating pricing?
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<strong>
<span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer.
           </span>
</strong>
          Penetrating pricing is the method of pricing in which the entrepreneur introduces its product in the market with low price compared to competitors. The low price increases the sale of the product tremendously. Normally for keeping low price, the profit margin is normally kept very low. The product thus captures the major part of the market e.g. Hero Honda, CD Dawn motorbike was introduced with the same pricing method. The CD Dawn penetrated into the market and captured major part of the market. Recently Bajaj CT-100 also followed the tactics.
          <br/>
          Wheel active detergent powder kept the price of Rs. 20 per half kilogram. This also captured the market quickly.

           </span>
</strong>
          Causes of business failure of Raghav:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
            Lack of adequate cash flow:
           </strong>
           Many small businesses fail because owners have a difficult time projecting what cash will come in every month, and thus, how much can go out. Raghav failed to estimate the correct expense which is required to run the business on a daily basis.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Management incompetence:
           </strong>
           Raghav worked on very thin margins which led to huge losses as well as he did not have control over his staff.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Diminished customer base:
           </strong>
           Raghav did not keep a track of his customer base. Competition can cause the customer base to diminish.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Poor system of control:
           </strong>
           Raghav could not have proper internal control over activities which led to the failure of his business.

<strong>
<span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer.
           </span>
</strong>
          The concept for enterprise marketing is sales promotion. Sales promotion is one level or type of marketing aimed either at the consumer or at the distribution channel (in the form of sales-incentives). It is used to introduce new product, clear out inventories, attract traffic, and to lift sales temporarily.
          <br/>
          The concept for growth strategy is acquisition. Acquisition are often made as part of a company’s growth strategy whereby it is more beneficial to take over an existing firm’s operations and niche compared to expanding on its own. Acquisitions are often paid in cash, the acquiring company’s stock or a combination of both.

          </li>
<li>
           Advantages of Cost Plus Pricing Method:
           <br/>
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">
            (a) Easy: This method of pricing is very simple method. It can easily be used for determining the price.
           </span>
<br/>
           (b) Flexible: Any changes in the cost of production or the margin of profit change the price in the same direction. It automatically gets adjusted to the change.
           <br/>
           (c) Visible profit margin: Profit margin is not to be calculated. It is already fixed. Thus, by multiplying the profit per unit with the volume of the product, the total profit can be determined.
           <br/>
           (d) Increases efficiency: Any upward rise in cost is easily visible. This provides an idea to the entrepreneur to adjust his production for keeping the cost as low as possible.
           <br/>
           (e) Less calculation: Comparatively less calculations are involved, which makes the implementation of this method simple.
           <br/>

           <br/>
           (a) Suitable only for single product:A firm involved in production of only one type of product finds it convenient. In case the firm decides about variation, then this method cannot be successfully used.
           <br/>
           (b) Could neglect the competitive price: In case the sum of cost price and profit is more than the competitive price, then the sale of the product will be low.
           <br/>
           (c) Consumers’ preference: It is not considered while fixing the price by this method. This method does not provide much scope for selling the product discriminately to different group of customers.
