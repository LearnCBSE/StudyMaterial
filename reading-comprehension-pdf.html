         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Skim once as rapidly as possible to determine the main idea before you look at the questions. Don’t worry about words you don’t know at this stage.
          </li>
<li>
           Underline the words that you do not understand to facilitate a complete understanding of the passage. This will enable you to solve the vocabulary questions quicker.
          </li>
<li>
           Look through questions carefully. You are advised to keep to the order in which the questions appear in the test paper. Read intensively the portion relevant to the answers.
          </li>
<li>
           Concentrate on the vocabulary items and puzzle out the meaning of any words you don’t know from the context.
          </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h3-1">
          Most passages require at least two readings
         </h3>
<ul>
<li>
           Before writing the answer, check the questions again to be sure you’ve really understood them.
          </li>
<li>
           You must write complete sentences as answers.
          </li>
<li>
           Answers must be relevant and to the point. If the question is for one mark given one point. If it is for two marks give at least two points unless specified differently in the paper.

          Steps to Follow Skimming for the Main Ideas
         </h3>
<ul>
<li>
           Read the title of the passage / poem carefully. Determine what clues it gives you as to what the passage /
           <br/>
           poem is about.
          </li>
<li>
           Watch for key words like ’causes, ’’results, ’’effects, ’etc. Do not overlook signal words such as those
           <br/>
           suggesting controversy (e.g., ’versus, ’’pros and cons’), which indicate that the author is planning to present
           <br/>
           but sides of an argument.
          </li>
<li>
           Concentrate on the main ideas and ignore the details.

          How to Approach Reading Comprehension Questions
         </h3>
<h4 id="h4-1">
          The ‘why’ question
         </h4>
<p>
          In the ‘why’ question you are required to give reasons, provide explanations and give evidence for an answer. It is essential therefore, to look out for word that show cause, effect and purpose in order to arrive at the answer. These words are:
          <br/>
          (i) Cause word; Cause words signal the cause or reason for an event or an action. These include:
          <br/>
          (ii) Effect words; effect words signal the result of an event or an action. These include:
          <br/>
          (iii) Purpose words ; purpose words indicate the reason for an event or an action. These include :
         </p>
<h4 id="h4-1">
          The inference question
         </h4>
<p>
          In the inference question you are required to make a deduction or draw a conclusion based on the information given in the passage. Since these are not straightforward questions, it is essential therefore, to read between the lines for clues or hidden meanings. This can be done by understanding certain key words and phrases. At times, you can draw an inference only after reading the entire poem / passage.

</div>
<h4 id="h4-1">
          The rephrasing question
         </h4>

          At times you are required to explain a word/phrase in your own words or substitute a word/phrase in the
          <br/>
          passage without altering its meaning. To do so it is essential to understand the word/phrase in its context.
          <br/>

          Reading Comprehension | Unseen Passage 1
         </h3>
<p>
          The seasonal problem of water taps running dry is plaguing most of our major cities. With the bigger rivers flowing in trickles and ponds and wells reduced to clay-pits, village women in remote areas have to fetch every drop of water for drinking, cooking, washing and so on, across large distances. This has only worsened a perennial problem, that of widespread pollution of water, rendering it unfit for human consumption. The monsoons—and the attendant floods—will not solve this problem. The Delhi Administration is seriously worried about the threat to civic health posed by the polluted waters of the Jamuna. Two new tanks are to be set up to treat sewage. At present only 60 per cent of the 200 million gallons of the city’s sewage receives any kind of treatment before it is dumped into the river which supplies water not only to this city but to innumerable towns and villages downstream. The Ganga, the Jamuna, the Cauvery, in fact all our important rivers, serving many urban conglomerations are fast becoming a major source of disease.
          <br/>
          A comprehensive bill, introduced in Parliament recently, envisages the setting up of Central and State boards for the prevention and control of water pollution. But it will obviously take some time before legislation is passed and effectively implemented. Meanwhile the problem continues to swell. r
          <br/>
          According to a survey of eight developing countries conducted a couple of years ago, 90 per cent of all child deaths were due to water-borne diseases. It is the same unchanged story today. In a country like India, a burgeoning population continuing to use the open countryside as a lavatory means that, with every dust storm and rain, human excreta laden with germs and parasite spores find their way to ponds, shallow wells and even the streams and rivers. Only 18 per cent of the rural folk have access to potable water.

          Reading Comprehension | Unseen Passage 2
         </h3>
<p>
          Srinivasa Ramanujan was one of the greatest mathematical genius of the world. Born in a poor Brahmin family, he gave no indication of his hidden talent. He was born at Erode in Coimbatore in 1887. His father was an accountant to a cloth merchant who had to maintain a large family on a small income. Srinivasa was granted half exemption of fees when he stood first in the Primary School Examination in the whole of Tanjore District.
          <br/>
          From his childhood Ramanujan was of a quiet and dreamy temperament. He had answer to all sums that puzzled his classmates and seniors. Figures did not worry him, no calculation was too difficult for him. Things which were dark and muddled to his class-mates were as clear as daylight to him. He always helped them with generosity which was the most lovable feature of his character all through his career.
          <br/>
          When he was in second class his curiosity upon the subject of the “Highest Truth” in Mathematics was roused. Later on when he moved into the Third Standard, he asked for problems of Mathematics of higher nature. While in Fourth Standard, he could solve the most difficult problems of Trigonometry. He obtained Ewler’s Theorems and proved them. He followed Carr’s Synopsis of Pure Mathematics. He solved all the problems without any other book to aid him. To him each solution was a triumph which encouraged him to a fresh endeavour.
          <br/>
          Ramanujan won Subramanyam Scholarship usually awarded for proficiency in English as well as Mathematics. But the passion for Mathematics gained on him, he neglected all other subjects so much that he failed to gain promotion to higher class, thereby losing his scholarship. This was a great calamity of which he had never dreamt. He had no money, no means of earning, no books, no influence. No help came to him from outside. He was now eighteen without any definite plan. He joined Pachaiyapsa’s college Madras (Now in Chennai) but had to return home due to illness.

          The Aravali Range is affected from human activities like stone crushing, cutting of trees in forest area of Aravali, construction on large scale, mining, dispense and dumping of waste. Such activities affect the environment of Aravali and its surrounding areas environment. Some of the famous lakes like Badkhal lake, Dhauj Jheel, Surajkund Lake, Damdama Lake on the Aravaii range had gone dry in last five years because of illegal mining and change of pattern in the natural drainage system. These lakes are dumped with waste material which affected ground water flow. Drying of these lakes also indicates that in future ground water will be not available in this area if the relevant steps for recovery are not taken.
          <br/>
          The mindless mining in one of the oldest hills in the world has devastated the range. In several places, the miners have gone so deep that the water table has been exposed, forming lakes amidst the blasted ranges. The Rajasamand lake in Udaipur, which always had water dried up recently.
          <br/>
          In May 2009, after months of media “and public protests, along with several environmental groups, the Supreme Court banned mining in an area of 448 square km, across Faridabad, Gurgaon and Mewat districts in Haryana, that was once supposed to be set aside for a national park. This comes after SC’s earlier judgment in 1994 that allowed limited mining on the basis of the sustainable development principle and under strict guidelines, which were violated by local miners as the court ruled
          <br/>
          The Supreme Court on February 20, 2010 directed cancellation of 157 mining leases operating in Rajasthan’s eco-sensitive Aravaii Hills and asked the Forest Survey of India to carry out satellite imagery of the entire 50,000 sq km range spread across 15 districts of the State to assess the extent of ecological damage. Giving four months time to the FSI to complete the task, the Special Bench of Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, Justices S.H. Kapadia and Aftab Alam directed all mines in the area to stop operation till then.
          <br/>
          The direction follows an earlier order passed by the Supreme Court in May 2009 freezing all mining activities along the Aravaii Range situated in Haryana.

          There are two problems which cause great worry to our educationists—the problem of religious and moral instruction in a land of many faiths and the problem arising out of a large variety of languages.
          <br/>
          Taking up the education of children we see that they should be trained to love one another, to be kind and helpful to all, to be tender to the lower animals and to observe and think right. The task of teaching them how to read and write and to count and calculate is important, but it should not make us lose sight of the primary aim of moulding personality in the right way.
          <br/>
          For this, it is necessary to call into aid, culture, tradition and religion. But in our country we have, in the same school, to look after boys and girls bom in different faiths and belonging to families that live diverse ways of life and follow different forms of worship associated with different denominations of religion. It will not do to tread the easy path of evading the difficulty by attending solely to physical culture and intellectual education. We have to evolve a suitable technique and method for serving the spiritual needs of school children professing different faiths. We should thereby promote an atmosphere of mutual respect, a fuller understanding and helpful co-operation among the different communities in our society. Again we must remain one people and we have therefore to give basic training in our schools to speak and understand more languages than one and to appreciate and respect the different religions prevailing in India. It is not right for us in India to be dissuaded from this by considerations as to overtaking the young mind. What is necessary must be done. And it is not in the fact too great a burden.

          Doolittle. I do not care for the lecturing. I can lecture at length till they become blue in the face, and I will not show any signs of fatigue. It is his having made a gentleman of me that I object to. I never asked him to make a gentleman of me. I was happy and I was free. I pressed hard everybody for money when I wanted it, in the same way as I pressed you, Henry Higgins. Now I am worried. Now I am a prisoner and everybody requests me for money. It’s very lucky for me, says my lawyer. “Is it”? I ask him. I mean it’s a good thing for him. When I was a poor man and had to engage a lawyer once when they found a dead baby in the dust cart, he turned me out and shut his doors on me as quickly as he could. It was the same with the doctors. They used to push me out of the hospital before I could hardly stand on my legs, and I had nothing to pay. Now they find out that I’m not a healthy man and can’t live unless they look after me twice a day. In the house, I’m not allowed to do any work for myself; Somebody else must do it and demand payment from me for it. A year ago, I did not have a relative in the world except two or three that would not speak me. Now I have fifty relatives so poor that they do not earn even a decent week’s wages among the lot of them. I have to live for others and not for myself; that is middle class morality. You talk of losing Eliza. Don’t you be anxious. 1 bet she’s on my doorsteps by this time. She could support herself easily by selling flowers as I was not considered respectable enough. And the next one to demand money from me will be you, Henry Higgins. I’ll have to learn to speak middle class language from you, instead of speaking proper English which is natural to me. That is where you’ll come in and I dare say that is why you wrote the letter about me.

          Kisan Bapat Baburao Hazare was born on 15 Jan. 1940 at the village Ralegaon Siddhi in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra. He is popularly recognized as Anna Hazare. He is at present 73-year-old bachelor. A book by Swami Vivekanand changed his course of fife. The book revealed to him that the ultimate motive of human life should be service to humanity. He realised that serving for the betterment of the common people is equivalent to offering a prayer to God. .
          <br/>
          Anna is well known and respected for upgrading the ecology and economy of the village of Ralegaon Siddhi which is located in the drought prone Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra state. The erstwhile barren village has metamorphosed into a unique model of rural development due to its effective water conservation methods, which made the villagers self-sufficient. Earlier, the same village witnessed alcoholism, utter poverty and migration to urban slums. Inspired by Hazare’s unique approach of salvaging a hopeless village, the state government has implemented the ‘Model Village’ scheme as part of its official strategy. Hazare is now synonymous with rural development in India.
          <br/>
          Anna Hazare is the face of India’s fight against corruption. He has taken that fight to the corridors of power and challenged the government at the highest level. People, the common man and well-known personalities alike, are supporting him in the hundreds swelling to the thousands.
          <br/>
          Government has awarded Mr. Hazare with the Padma Shri and Padma Bhushan awards, the nation’s third and fourth highest civilian awards respectively, for his social work.
          <br/>
          He lives on his pension from army service in a room in the temple in his village. He fought from the front to have Right to Information (RTI) implemented. He is fighting for the implementation of the Jan Lokpal Bill, the anticorruption bill.

          The Russian writer, Leo Tolstoy, gave up a life of wealth and comfort in order to help the poor. He taught that all types of violence were wicked and that all people ought to live together in love and to cooperate with one another. Gandhi was very much interested in his writings and teachings. Indeed the two great men must have been alike in many of their ideas.
          <br/>
          In one of his stories Tolstoy describes a certain village in Russia where a peasant named Ivan lived. Everyone thought that he must be a very happy man, for he was comfortably off and lacked nothing that he needed. He had three sons, all of them were able to work. The eldest was married and the second was going to be married and the youngest was able to look after the horses. His wife was an extremely capable woman and his daughter-in-law was steady and hard-working. Ivan’s old father lived with them, but he was now an invalid and had no longer any control over his son. Their fields produced good crops and they had quite enough food for their own needs. All their clothes, coats, shirts, trousers, socks and dresses were made by the two women. Unfortunately, however, the members of the family were not nearly as contented as they ought to have been. This was because of a quarrel between them and their next-door neighbour, limping Gabriel.

<p>
          Thomas Alva Edison invented electric light. He loved to do experiments and to ask funny questions. Once he asked his teacher how the kites could fly without wings. The puzzled teacher thought him to be stupid and naughty and turned him out of the school. He was just eight years old when it happened. Edison’s best teacher was his mother. She answered his questions, helped and guided him.
          <br/>
          One day he saw a bird. It ate some worms and Hew. Edison prepared a mixture of the pulped worms and made a maid servant drink it to see if she could also fly. He was warned by his mother not to repeat it. Once, he imitated a hen and sat down on her eggs to hatch them. But he only broke the eggs and spoiled his shorts.
          <br/>
          He read a lot of books. He bought them with the pocket money he received. At the age of twelve Edison became a newspaper boy in the railway. Out of his new income he purchased more books and carried out his experiments. He also gave a dollar every night to his mother. He began to publish his own newspaper and made more money. With it he set up a small laboratory in his railway wagon. One day a bit of phosphorous fell down and caught fire. It burnt his newspapers. He was turned out of the job at the next station.

          Human ear is meant for receiving sound of normal range of decibels. Sound received beyond that measure would not only be jarring but also damaging to our hearing sense organs. How many of us take care of this? It may be a TV programme or a radio broadcast, playing a tape-recorder or any other instrument, even a gossip or a chit-chat in a company, all are heard at a very high pitch. We may be used to it but what about those living around us. Our neighbour may be a serious student, a sick person, or a peace-loving being. Have we ever thought of him? How much agony do we cause to him/her? The neighbour being a person of cool temperament does not quarrel with us and suffers in silence. The poor fellow shuts the windows and doors and puts cotton in his ears to reduce the impact of high-pitched noises. When shall we learn the simple civic sense?
          <br/>
          It may be a marriage ceremony or any other function, a ritual or a prayer, there is generally a fashion of hiring a loud-speaker to he used the loudest besides engaging a band and other means of producing sound. The pitch is kept so high that sensitive beings get shocks. Even the stones or bricks of a building shake and the impression is gathered that the building may collapse one day because of this.

          We all travel by public transport, train or bus and have had many bitter and sad experiences. Orderly queue system at the time of either purchasing the tickets or boarding the train/bus is rarely followed. Everyone in his self-interest flouts the genuine rights of Others. Those who are already occupying‘a seat would very reluctantly permit others to sit even on the neighbouring vacant seat. When they do so they grab about half of that vacant seat also. The thought of giving help to other needy ones rarely stirs them.
          <br/>
          Some people are fond of chewing betels with tobacco. They spit and spit frequently all around showing no respect for public property. They forget that they have paid for journey and not for spoiling the train/bus. They throw all rubbish and leftovers wherever they so desire. Our public transport, our roads and streets, our public places and buildings are seen littered with all sorts of stinking refuse that tells upon our health and vigour.
          <br/>
          In spite of the statutory warning “Smoking is injurious to health” we do not notice any slump in the sale of cigarettes or bidis. The pity is the smokers in their own enjoyment do not think of the people around them. Sometimes the surroundings become unfit for breathing. Passive smoking causes more harm.

          Coal-tar is black and sticky. For a long time, people thought of it as a nuisance. This oily, smelling substance blocked up the pipes, so gas-makers and coke-makers washed it out and tried to get rid of it. Some of it was sold for roofing but most of it was wasted. But this evil-smelling nuisance has been found to be one of the most useful of raw materials in the world. From it the chemist is able to make almost anything he wishes—from medicines to explosives, from dyes to disinfectants. Not all these things are made from coal-tar itself. Only about a dozen simple products come from it. But from these the chemist is able to make thousands of new substances. Some of the most important things made from coal-tar are dyes. A whole rainbow of colours is made from coal-tar. More than nine hundred different coal-tar dyes are in common use. These dyes not only give fine colours to our clothes, ribbons, shoes and hats, but also give pleasing colours to many of our sweets and drinks. Some of the coal-tar dyes serve another purpose besides that of giving colour; they are used to heal wounds. Many important medicines are made from coal-tar. Carbolic acid is one such. Another is used by a dentist when he pulls out a tooth. It deadens the nerves in the gum so that no pain is left.

          The earth is occasionally hit by craggy remnants of creation known as asteroids. About 150 are known to cross the earth’s path. These lie in a loose belt between the Mars and Jupiter like so much rubble left over from creation. The first asteroid was too faint to be seen by the naked eye. It was discovered by an Italian monk named Guiseppi Piazzi, working at an observatory in Palermo, Sicily. The largest found so far is about 8 km wide.

          Slamming into the earth at roughly 26 km a second, a large asteroid could explode with the force of a million hydrogen bombs, lifting enough rock and dust to block most sunlight.

          The career of Lincoln is often held up to ambitious young Americans as an example to show what a man may achieve by his native strength, with no advantages of birth or environment or education. In this there is nothing improper, nothing fanciful. The moral is one which may well be drawn, and in which those on whom early life fortune has not smiled may find encouragement. But the example is, after all, no great encouragement to ordinary men, for Lincoln was an extraordinary man.
          <br/>
          He triumphed over the adverse conditions of his early years because Nature had bestowed on him high and rare powers. Superficial observers who saw his homely aspect and plain manners, and noted that his fellow-townsmen, when asked why they so trusted him answered that it was for his commonsense, failed to see that his commonsense was a part of his genius. What is commonsense but the power of seeing the fundamentals of any practical question, and of disengaging them from the accidental and transient features that may overlie these fundamentals—the power, to use a familiar expression, of getting down to bed-rock? One part of this power is the faculty for perceiving what the average man will think and can be induced to do.

<p>
          All of us have read thrilling stories in which the hero had only a limited and specified time to live. Sometimes it was as long as a year; sometimes as short as twenty-four hours. But always we were interested in discovering just how the doomed man chose to spend his last days or his last hours. I speak, of course of_ free men who have a choice, not condemned criminals whose sphere of activities is strictly delimited.
          <br/>
          Such stories set us thinking, wondering what we should do under similar circustances. What events, what experiences, what associations should we crowd into those last hours of mortal beings? What happiness should we find in reviewing the past, what regrets? .
          <br/>
          Sometimes I have thought it would be an excellent rule to live each day as if we should die tomorrow. Such an attitude would emphasize sharply the values of life. We should live each day with a gentleness, a vigour, and a keenness of appreciation which are often lost when time stretches before us in the constant panorama of more days and months and years to come. There are those, of course, who would adopt the epicurean motto of ‘Eat, drink and be merry’, but most people would be chastened by the certainty of impending death.

<p>
          Grimsdyke’s reluctance to pass examination was wholly the fault of his grandmother, a well-to-do old lady who had passed the long-drawn-out twilight of her life in Bournemouth. As she had nothing else to occupy her, she developed a wide selection of complaints, which were soothed away, all in good time, by the expensive attentions of her charming physicians. Her regard for the medical profession mounted with each indisposition, and was tempered only with the regret that she had not a single medical gentleman in her own family. The only person who could have rectified the omission was young Grimsdyke, and she conceived the idea while he was still at school of enticing him into the profession by offering to pay his expenses for the course. Unfortunately, the grandmother shortly afterwards developed a malady beyond the abilities of her doctors and was carried away; but her will contained a clause bequeathing a thousand a year to the young man during the time that he was a medical student.
          <br/>
          Grimsdyke did not immediately realize the full significance of this, and had begun his first year’s study at St. Swithin’s before it dawned on him that he had an excellent opportunity to spend the rest of his life in London on a comfortable allowance without the tedium of doing any work. He therefore took great pains always to fail his examinations.

          There was at first some apprehension that I had come to make further enquiries about the Achingmori tragedy. At a remote village at the very end of the valley, the leaders did not come to see me for a considerable time, though I was immediately surrounded by a large crowd of ordinary people. But presently the Chief, dressed in fine handwoven robes and attended by a small body-guard marched up in grim silence. The crowd scattered and we were left face to face. It was an electric moment; for the first time the chief’s eyes rested on, shall we say, a regular subscriber to the New Statesman. Here, he said to himself, is civilization. He obviously did not care greatly for what he saw. I could feel him drinking me in— the undistinguished features, the spectacles, the worn-out coat, frayed and baggy trousers, the muddy boots. It that all, he seemed to say, that they have to offer? He stood upright motionless, and glowered at me, while he fingered, rather suggestively I thought, his formidable sword. I tried a smile—there was no response. I offered the customary gifts—he waved them aside. I tried the few words I knew—and with a gesture of dignity and scorn he handed me a present, a solitary egg; white and chill it nestled in my palm.

          Another, and perhaps the most important, reason was that a number of artistes dispersed around a town seeking lodgings for the night provided the best possible form of advertisement, for by the time the various landladies had been to the butcher, baker and candlestick maker to buy whatever was needed for their new lodgers, the whole town knew that the circus had arrived.
          <br/>
          The rest of the personnel—the tentmen, grooms, menagerie men and tradesmen—cannot really be classed as circus folk. Undoubtedly no circus of the magnitude of the Sanger show could have travelled without them, but they were for the most part a very mixed and very rough lot, picked up whenever and wherever possible, with no questions asked. There were, of course, many admirable characters amongst them, hardworking and trustworthy men who had travelled with various circuses for years, but these were always a minority. A preponderance of the rest would be Army and Navy reservists, and often deserters from these services whom I frequently saw hidden with considerable ingenuity their comrades when the authorities came searching for them.

          Students sometimes make heavy weather of their reading through not realizing that there are two quite different approaches to reading. In one we are concerned with details. We may be dealing with a detailed philosophical or mathematical or scientific argument; we must master each stage before proceeding to the next. We may be examining a poem minutely to see each tiny effect created by . the poet’s choice and order of words, or wrestling with a difficult passage in Greek or German. Here we probably read every word, we certainly weigh every sentence. But there is another sort of reading which is equally valid and equally important. In this we want to see an overall picture; we want to appreciate a play or novel as a whole; sometimes we want to give ourselves general background knowledge without worrying about details; sometimes we want to read quickly through a general work to see if there is anything relevant to a particular problem or subject on which we are working. Here we skim and skip; we take in whole paragraphs, even pages, at a glance; and it is nothing to read a 300-page book in a couple of hours or less. These two methods of reading are both important, and they must not be confused.

          The circus of my young days was very much a world of its own customs, language and working and living conditions helped to make it a community set apart in which everyone—in so far as artistes and management were concerned— was related to everyone else. The language was freely interlarded with a jargon of pidgin-Italian which can perhaps be traced back to an invasion of Italian talent during the latter half of the eighteenth century. Such words as ‘bono’ (good), used both as an adjective and an exclamation of approval, and ‘si’ (yes) point to this, but other words had different foreign origins and there was an abundance of slang and technical terms both peculiar to the circus and shared with other branches of the entertainment world.
          <br/>
          All outside the circus fraternity were known as, jossers’, and for this strange and almost unknown world of ‘josserdom’ the circus folk had a tolerant pity—an outlook which seemed rather odd to me, in as much as I soon came to realise that jossers lived well and slept well in permanent stone or brick-built buildings while we of the circus were up early and to bed late, always packing up and unpacking and sleeping rough under canvas, or the stars, or at best in a wooden caravan, and except in the winter seasons were seldom in the same place for more than twenty-four hours.

<p>
          The advance of the age of machinery has not been all a gain; in fact against all that the machine has given us must be set one serious disadvantage—the decline in craftsmanship. In days gone by a furniture-maker would use with care and pride the tools which, over a period of years, had become almost a part of him, and a chair took shape before his eyes. It was the work not only of his hands but also of his mind, and expressed something of himself; no other chair, even one made by his own hands, would be just like that one. So it was with all craftsmen; everything they made was their own work, the result of their skill in the use of their tools, and they could look on it with pardonable pride.
          <br/>
          What is the position today? In the large factories of the machine age, rows of men are engaged in producing not a whole article, but merely one part of that article. The individual workman does not even have the satisfaction of feeling that this part is the work of his own hands, because it is made by a complicated machine. All he has to do is to feed the raw material into the machine, press a lever, and put the finished part on a moving belt, which will convey it to the assembly lines.

         </h3>
<p>
          Those responsible for teaching young people have resorted in different periods of history, to a variety of means for making their pupils learn. The earliest of these was the threat of punishment, which meant that the pupil who was slow, careless or inattentive risked either physical chastisement or the loss of some expected privilege or treat. Learning was thus to some extent, associated with fear, particularly in the minds of those who found certain subjects hard to master.
          <br/>
          At a later period, pupils were encouraged to learn in the hope of some kind of reward. This often took the form of marks awarded daily or weekly for work done, and sometimes of prizes given at the end of each year to the best scholars. Such a system appealed to the competitive spirit, but it often had just as depressing an effect as the older system of punishment on the slow but willing pupil.
          <br/>
          The two systems suggest that teachers felt that their pupils had to be either compelled or bribed to learn. In the nineteenth century, however, there sprang up a different type of teacher, passionately convinced that learning was worthwhile for its own sake, and that the young learner’s principal stimulus should be neither anxiety to avoid a penalty nor ambition to win a reward, but sheer desire to learn.

<p>
          It seems to be essential to the mental health and happiness of every individual that he should have something to which he can assert exclusive possession something, as we say, that he can call his own. Delight in owning things usually shows itself as early as the second year of life, when the words “my” and “mine” are among the first that the child learns to utter.
          <br/>
          Parents and teachers can make use of this characteristic of human nature in many ways. In the home a child can be led to acquire orderly habits by being encouraged to arrange his own possessions tidily; and this valuable training can be continued at school, where he can be helped to keep carefully arranged samples of his own handiwork, such as drawings, paintings, specimens of his handwriting, well done arithmetic exercises and the like.
          <br/>
          Closely linked with pride of possession is an impulse that appears early in the life of most children—the impulse to collect things. This too the educator can use to good effect. By the exercise of a little tact he can inspire a child to collect postage stamps, and may thus lead him to a lasting interest in history and geography. Or, by encouraging him to collect wild flowers, shells or pebbles, he may help him to become a naturalist.

          But first—just what is an earthquake? And what causes it? In the early history of the earth, when it was cooling down, the rocks deep in the earth’s crust created huge ‘islands’ which floated on the softer and hotter rocks below rather like wood floats on water. Slowly, these islands drifted apart to make the land- masses we know today as continents. But even now these ‘islands’ are not stable, and are still drifting very, very slowly. It is these imperceptible movements which create stresses in the rock, many miles below the surface. Ever so often, one of these stresses will break and on the surface the deep underground movement is felt as an earthquake.
          <br/>
          There are three large regions in the world where earthquakes are most likely to happen. Scientists call them earthquake zones. The first runs along the east coast of the Asian continent up through Japan, across Alaska, then down the west coast of North America, crossing Mexico and ending somewhere in the Caribbean Sea. The second runs down the west coast of South America. The third runs across the south of Europe and North Africa, through Greece and Turkey and into the middle of Asia.

          Things are very different today. Doctors or barristers find nothing undignified or shameful in putting on an apron to help in the kitchen or nursery and even boast of their superior organisation of the washing of dishes of the household or personal linen. The school-boy is more often than formerly expected to help his mother. One reason for the change is the shortage of domestic servants. Girls could once be found to do the hard work in middle and upper class homes for very moderate wages; such girls can now-a-days earn in factories in a short working day more money than most householders can afford to pay. Thus the wife now does the house-work herself with the aid of labour-saving equipment; and she expects some help from her husband.

          It has become common knowledge that yoga is good for you. Currently yoga is being used as a therapy for cancer, infertility, lung disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, insomnia, high blood pressure, and joint pain. Yet there is very little awareness and understanding on exactly how yoga heals, even in the yoga and medical communities. The key is to understand the relationships between stress, yoga, and disease.
          <br/>
          Medical research estimates that as much as 90 percent of illness and disease is stress related. A few of the many diseases and conditions that have been linked to an overactive stress response include : cardio-vascular disease, depression, anxiety, some types of diabetes mellitus, etc.
          <br/>
          What we feel as stress, is the product of the sympathetic nervous system or the “fight or flight” response ; an almost instantaneous surge in heart rate, cardiac output, blood pressure, sweating, shallow breathing, and metabolism, combined with a tensing of muscles. Internally, the “fight or flight” response shuts down digestion and elimination and reduces blood flow to the internal organs. Short term, this stress reaction is a good thing. The “fight or flight” response prepares us to respond to any environmental threat by fighting against it or fleeing from it. But long term, continuous exposure to stress is harmful, placing excess wear and tear on the body’s systems and severely limiting the body’s natural maintenance and healing abilities.
          <br/>
          Chronic stress can lead to continuously high levels of cortisol. This hormone at normal levels helps to maintain an active, healthy body (including regulation of metabolism and blood pressure). But excessive amounts of cortisol can suppress the immune system and cause sleep disturbances, and loss of appetite. High levels of cortisol can also increase your heart rate, blood pressure and your cholesterol and triglyceride levels (risk factors for both heart attacks and strokes). The byproducts of cortisol act as sedatives, which can lead to changes in mood, especially to feelings of depression.

          English Reading Comprehension | Unseen Passage 26
         </h3>
<p>
          Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel started his movement in Bardoli in 1928. This movement earned Patel the title of Sardar or Leader.
          <br/>
          Gandhiji had planned to make Bardoli the centre of his non-cooperation movement in its first phase, but after Chauri-Chaura incident he dropped this idea. Bardoli soon became the target of the British Government’s displeasure. So, revenue was raised by 22%. Cultivators were compelled to protest but the Government remained unmoved. The delegations, therefore, met Vallabhbhai who studied the situation carefully and then spoke to Gandhiji. He told him that it was necessary to fight against the authorities for the cause of the farmers. Gandhiji gave his nod and Vallabhbhai in his own way, persuading the people to sacrifice everything, organized a farmer’s movement. It was a non-cooperation movement, fully non-violent and disciplined. The Government cracked down on the agitators but they fearlessly continued their struggle under the leadership of Vallabhbhai. All sorts of cruelties were inflicted upon them but the farmers remained united. Their morale remained on a high too. At last, the government had to draw up a compromise and meet all the demands of the farmers of the Bardoli Taluka. The agitation under the leadership of Vallabhbhai Patel was a grand success and had great impact on all future non-cooperation movements throughout the country. It brought great name and fame to Vallabhbhai. His dynamic leadership earned him the title of Sardar or true leader from Gandhiji.
