</span>
          (i) They are formed in the process of socialisation and may relate to anything in the world.
          <br/>
          For example: A person may have positive and negative attitudes towards religion, politics, politicians or countries.
          <br/>
          (ii) (a) Affects behaviour: People have a natural tendency to maintain consistency between attitude and behaviour. Attitudes can lead to intended behaviour if there is no external intervent.
          <br/>
          (b) It is invisible: It constitutes a psychological phenomenon which cannot be directly observed. However, we may observe an attitude indirectly through observing its consequences. For example, if a person is highly productive, we may infer that he has a positive attitude towards his/her work.
          <br/>
          (iii) (a) Respect for work: Entrepreneur culture respects and values work. Entrepreneur who are successful believe that to achieve one has to do hard-work. To them work is worship.
          <br/>
          (b) Innovation and creativity: These are the most important values found among most of the entrepreneurs. Creativity is the ability to bring something new into existence or new ways of doing things and innovativeness is the ability to make it work in practice. For example, earlier, hair oil was available only in tins and introducing it in plastic small packs has become convenient for customers to carry and use.
          <br/>
          Innovation refers to the process of doing new things. It brings into reality a new idea, a new process, a new product or innovativeness can be seen through actions such as: Sachet Market – small sachet of shampoo, oil, etc.
          <br/>
          (iv) C. Danhof has broadly classified entrepreneurs into four types. These are:
          <br/>
          (a) Innovative Entrepreneur (b) Imitative Entrepreneur
          <br/>
          (c) Fabian Entrepreneur (d) Drone Entrepreneur
          <br/>
          (a) Smart organisations will seek out individuals who like to invent, innovate, and want to the best idea within them.
          <br/>
          (v) These individuals can work independently but even more important can work seamlessly as part of an integrated team structure and also effectively embrace and embody the culture of the entrepreneur’s host organisation. Intrapreneurs are most successful when management empowers and supports them and in turn the intrapreneurs represent the best interests of their organisations, while earning the respect of corporate peers.
          <br/>

<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
</span>
          (i) The central idea running through the process of attitude formation is that, the thoughts, feelings and tendencies to behave are acquired or learned gradually. The attitudes are acquired from the following sources:
          <br/>
          1.
          <strong>
           Direct Personal Experience:
          </strong>
          The quality of an individual’s direct experience with the attitude object (work area) determines his/her attitude towards it.
          <br/>
          For example if a worker:
          <br/>
          • finds his/her job challenging,
          <br/>
          • always tries to understand supervisors and co-workers
          <br/>
          • is nature wise very cooperative
          <br/>
          • creates an healthy environment
          <br/>
          • completes the task on time
          <br/>
          • is satisfied and happy with the entire environment
          <br/>
          then he/she will have a positive attitude towards his/her job because of the quality of his/her direct experience with the job.
          <br/>
          2.
          <strong>
           Group Associations:
          </strong>
          Each and every individual working in an organisation are always influenced to one degree or another by other members in the group to which they belong. Their attitudes toward products ethics warfare and a multitude of other subjects are influenced strongly by groups that they value and with which they do or wish to associate. All those people involved in a group are, including family, working members, and peer groups, and cultural and sub-cultural groups, are important in affecting a person’s attitudinal development.
          <br/>
          3.
          <strong>
           Influential to Others:
          </strong>
<br/>
          • A consumer’s attitude can be formed and changed through personal contact with influential persons such as respected friends relatives and experts.
          <br/>
          • Opinion leaders are examples of people who are respected by their followers and who may strongly influence the attitudes and purchase behaviour of followers.
          <br/>
          • To capitalize on this type of influence, advertisers often use actors and actresses who look similar to or act similar to their intended audiences.
          <br/>
          People tend to like others who are similar to themselves because they believe that they share the same problems, form the same judgments and use the same criteria for evaluating products. Another application which advertisers use to influence audience attitudes is the so called slice of life commercial.
          <br/>
          For example: Sachin Tendulkar: Boost: Boost is the secret of my energy.
          <br/>
          Aishwarya Rai Bachchan in Kalyan Jewellers.
          <br/>
          These advertisements show typical people confronting typical problems and finding solutions in the use of the advertised brand, some examples include the advertisement of a specialised shampoo (to solve dandruff problems).
          <br/>
          (ii) Yes, it is a true statement. The process of learning attitudes starts right from childhood and continues throughout the life of a person. It means attitudes are gradually learnt over a period of time. However, in the beginning, the family members have a greater impact on the attitude of a child.
          <br/>
          (iii) Fabian Entrepreneurs: According to C. Danhof, Fabian entrepreneur are categorized in third group. Such entrepreneurs are very shy and lazy. They are very cautious. They do not venture or take risks. They are rigid and fundamental in their approach. Usually, they are second generation entrepreneurs in a family business enterprise. They follow the footsteps of their predecessors. They imitate only when they are sure that failure to do so would result in a loss of the relative position in the enterprise.
          <br/>
          (iv) Yes, Innovation and Creativity both are interrelated.
          <br/>
          These are the most important values found among most of the entrepreneurs. They are guided by these values when they come out with creative ideas, new products, services, processes, etc. to solve specific problems of the society.
          <br/>
          Creativity is the ability to see new ways of doing things and innovativeness is the ability to make it work in practice.
          <br/>
          For example, earlier hair oil was available only in tins and introducing it in plastic small packs has become convenient for customers to carry and use. Innovativeness can be seen through actions such as:
          <br/>
          (a) Sachet Market – small sachet of shampoo, oil, etc
          <br/>
          (b) Experimenting with new ideas for example introduction of debit and credit cards in the banking sector.
          <br/>
          (c) Facing uncertainty in order to try out new ideas.
          <br/>
          (d) Not giving up or becoming upset when errors occur.
          <br/>
          (v) Generally, the difference between entrepreneur and employee is that an entrepreneur is the owner of the enterprise and an employee is in the service of the enterprise and both work in the interest of the enterprise.

<br/>
          (a)
          <strong>
           Spontaneous Entrepreneurs
          </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
           They are also known as entrepreneurs:
          </strong>
<br/>
          They are motivated by their desire for self-fulfillment and to achieve or prove their excellence in job performance.
          <br/>
          They undertake entrepreneurial activities for their personal satisfaction in work, ego, or status.
          <br/>
          Their strength lies in their creative abilities.
          <br/>
          They are the natural entrepreneurs in any society. And do not need any external motivation.
          <br/>
          (b)
          <strong>
           Induced Entrepreneurs
          </strong>
<br/>
          Induced entrepreneurs enter into entrepreneurship because of various governmental supports.
          <br/>
          Interested entrepreneurs get support from the government to set up of their new enterprises in terms of financial assistance (in the form of Grants and Aids), incentives, concessions and other facilities.
          <br/>
          Sometimes prospective entrepreneurs are induced or even forced by their special circumstance, such as loss of job or inability to find a suitable job according to their talent and merit to adapt to entrepreneurship.
          <br/>
          (c)
          <strong>
           Motivated Entrepreneurs
          </strong>
<br/>
          Motivated Entrepreneurs are motivated by their desire to make use of their technical and professional expertise and skill in performing the job or project they have taken up.
          <br/>
          They have enough confidence in their abilities.
          <br/>
          They are highly ambitious and are normally not satisfied by the slow progress in their jobs.
          <br/>
          They enter entrepreneurship because of the possibility of making and marketing of some new products or service for the use of the prospective consumers. If the product or service is developed to a saleable stage and the customers accept the same, the entrepreneur is then further motivated by reward in terms of profit.
          <br/>
          (xii) In a civilized society some qualities like honesty, truthfulness, cooperation, integrity etc. as important for happy and healthy living. They are a set of beliefs or ideas that provide standards which guide behaviour. Such guiding principles established in a cultured society are called values. They provide us the direction in our life and helps us achieve our potential. Entrepreneurs share some of these qualities that guide and direct them and hence they have come to be called entrepreneurial values. They are a combination of a number of factors that shape an individual’s life in an environment. It implies that when an individual interacts with his environment, certain characteristics emerge to guide the individual in his pursuit.
          <br/>
          This diagram shows that a person develops certain core values as a result of an active interaction between the environmental factors, the personality factors and action factors. A study of such core values reveals that a set of four values are found to be prominent among entrepreneurs.
          <strong>
           They are:

<br/>
          1. Innovativeness and Creativity
          <br/>
          2. Independence or Ownership
          <br/>
          3. Quest for Outstanding Performance or Achievement
          <br/>
          4. Respect for Work.
          <br/>
          However, these values are not found in the same degree in all the entrepreneurs. In some, innovativeness and creativity may be stronger than
          <br/>
          other values while in some quest for achievement may be the strongest driving force. But, to become successful entrepreneurs, a knowledge of all these values is essential.
          <br/>
          (xiii) Esteem needs include the desire for self-respect, self-esteem, and the esteem of others.
          <br/>
          • When focused externally, these needs also include the desire for reputation, prestige, status, fame, glory, dominance, recognition, attention, importance and appreciation.
          <br/>
          • An individual eventually needs to feel that he/she has a social status. This goes beyond just having social relationships; the individual must feel that in work or at home he/she is making a contribution. This also includes recognition of achievement from others. And the need to feel good about themselves.
          <br/>
          (xiv) Creativity is the merging of ideas which have not been merged before. New ideas are formed by developing current ones within our minds. It is ranked by the ability to create, bring into existence, to invent, a new form to produce through imaginative skills, something new, it is an ability to generate new idea as by combining changing or re-applying existing ideas and innovation means doing something new or something different. The entrepreneurs are constantly on look out to do something and unique to meet the requirements of the customers.
          <br/>
          Competency in creativity and innovation are sometimes basic traits of certain individuals. He/she might not have any new ideas or may not inventors of new products and new methods of production but they have the ability to vision the future and have the possibility of making use of the inventions of their enterprise. He/she may use the creative ideas and innovative products and services to meet the challenges of a situation and to satisfy the changing taste and preference of customers adopt and apply new technique to meet the customers changing demand for product and take advantage of the utility of an idea or a product to create wealth.
          <br/>
          For Example,
          <br/>
          • Changes in the packaging of potato chips.
          <br/>
          • Tea bags.
          <br/>
          • Cup cakes.

          • Cadbury introduced ‘Celebration’s ? 100 single attractive pack with all types of Cadbury chocolates.
          <br/>
          (xv) Yes, I do agree that Intrapreneur is necessary for an organisation. The reasons are:
          <br/>

          (i) Entrepreneur is one who starts an enterprise, undertakes risk, problem solver, bears uncertainty and also performs the managerial functions of decision-making and coordinate with all employees.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Types of entrepreneur are as follows:
          </strong>
<br/>
<img alt="NCERT Solutions for Class 11 Entrepreneurship An Entrepreneur Q4" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-125450" height="485" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-11-Entrepreneurship-An-Entrepreneur-Q4.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-11-Entrepreneurship-An-Entrepreneur-Q4.png 724w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-11-Entrepreneurship-An-Entrepreneur-Q4-300x201.png 300w" width="724"/>
<br/>
          Motivation is essentially a process. It can be well expressed in the form of a model. On a careful analysis of the model, it can be understood that every individual possesses an urge or a need, or a multitude of needs, desires or expectations. The unsatisfied need leads to tension within the individual and motivates one to search for ways to relieve one’s own tension. That tension leads one to certain drives and searching alternatives to achieve one’s goal which will eventually reduce tension.
          <br/>
          (iii) Yes, it is true. Entrepreneurs cannot survive and grow without fulfilling the ethical responsibilities of society. Ethics is the knowledge of what is wrong and what is right. Business ethics are often guided by law, and it provides a basic framework that businesses may chose to follow in order to gain public acceptance. An entrepreneur has to follow his ethics to make sure the proper usage of human resources, country’s natural resources, serve the society and the proper development of the country.
          <br/>
<strong>
           It includes:
          </strong>
<br/>
          •  Giving proper wages to workers.
          <br/>
          •  Prohibiting child labour.
          <br/>
          •  Not polluting the environment with harmful industrial smoke and wastages.
          <br/>
          •  Ensuring proper and fuller utilization of natural resources.
          <br/>
          There are many duties and responsibilities of a person towards society, and towards nation. An entrepreneur as a part of the society and nation must follow ethical standards and if the enterprise abide the social and ethical responsibility then his /her business will flourish and then:
          <br/>
          (a)
          <strong>
           Reputation in the society:
          </strong>
          The reputation of the firm will be badly affected and the people would not like the company and, who does not serve the society.
          <br/>
          (b)
          <strong>
           Employees may leave:
          </strong>
          If the company/firm does not provide actual wages to the workers/employees then they may strike or may leave the organisation which will result in loss of production.
          <br/>
          (c)
          <strong>
           Product dissatisfaction:
          </strong>
          If the correct amount of quantity and good quality of the product is not provided, definitely the interest of people will move and they prefer other substitute goods.
          <br/>
          (d)
          <strong>
           Government can shut-down:
          </strong>
          If the firm does not follow its ethical responsibility, government has the power to seal and shut down, they can even arrest and charge penalties for not following the laws.
          <br/>
          These are the consequences which can take place if the enterprise does not follow.
          <br/>
          (iv) McClelland’s Need for Achievement Theory is one of content theories of motivation emphasising that human needs and incentives cause human behaviour.
          <br/>
          McClelland has identified three types of basic motivating needs:
          <br/>
<img alt="NCERT Solutions for Class 11 Entrepreneurship An Entrepreneur Q4.1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-125449" height="286" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 469px) 100vw, 469px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-11-Entrepreneurship-An-Entrepreneur-Q4.1.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-11-Entrepreneurship-An-Entrepreneur-Q4.1.png 469w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-11-Entrepreneurship-An-Entrepreneur-Q4.1-300x183.png 300w" width="469"/>
<br/>
          (1)
          <strong>
           Need for Achievement or Achievement Motive:
          </strong>
<br/>
          • It refers to one’s desire to accomplish something with own efforts and an intense desire to achieve.
          <br/>
          • This theory has identified four basic characteristics of high achievers:
          <br/>
          (a)
          <strong>
           Moderate risks:
          </strong>
          Taking moderate risks is the simple most descriptive characteristic of the person possessing high achievement need.
          <br/>
          (b)
          <strong>
           Immediate feedback:
          </strong>
          Person with high need for achievement desires activities which provide immediate and precise feedback information how he is progressing towards a goal.
          <br/>
          (c)
          <strong>
           Accomplishment:
          </strong>
          Person with high need for achievement finds accomplishing a task intrinsically satisfying in and of itself, or he does not expect or necessarily want the accompanying material rewards.
          <br/>
          (d)
          <strong>
           Preoccupation with the tasks:
          </strong>
          Once a high achiever selects a goal, he tends to be totally preoccupied with the task until it is successfully completed. He will not feel satisfied unless he has put his maximum effort in completing the task.
          <br/>
          • The need for achievement is characterized by the wish to take responsibility for finding solutions to problems, master complex tasks, set goals and get feedback on level of success.
          <br/>
          (2)
          <strong>
           Affiliation Motive or Need for Affiliation (N-Affil):
          </strong>
<br/>
          • This refers to needs to establish interact and maintain friendly relations with others. ,
          <br/>
          • According to this theory, people with high need for affiliation usually derive pleasure from being loved and tend to avoid the pain of being rejected.
          <br/>
          • They are concerned with maintaining pleasant social relationships, understanding, and enjoy consoling and helping others in trouble.
          <br/>
          • It is characterized by a desire to belong, an enjoyment of teamwork, a concern about interpersonal relationships, and a need to reduce uncertainty.
          <br/>
          (3)
          <strong>
           Need for Power or Power Motive (N-Pwr):
          </strong>
<br/>
          • The ability to induce or influence behaviour is power.
          <br/>
          • These means the one’s desire to dominate and influence others by using actions.
          <br/>
          • The need for power is characterized by a drive to control and influence others, a need to win arguments, a need to persuade and prevail.
          <br/>
          Such individuals are generally seeking positions of leadership; they are forceful, outspoken, hard headed and demanding.
          <br/>
          According to McClelland, the presence of these motives or drives in an individual indicates a predisposition to behave in certain ways. Therefore, from a manager’s perspective, recognizing which need is dominant in any particular individual affects the way in which that person can be motivated.
          <br/>
          People with achievement motives are motivated by standards of excellence, delineated roles and responsibilities and concrete, timely feedback. Those with affiliation motives are motivated when they can accomplish things with people they know and trust. And the power motive is activated when people are allowed to have an impact, impress those in power, or beat competitors.
          <br/>

          (a)
          <strong>
           Technical Entrepreneur:
          </strong>
          The entrepreneurs who are technically skilled by nature in the sense of having the capability of developing new and improved quality of goods and services out of their own knowledge, skill and specialization are called a technical entrepreneur. They are essentially compared to craftsmen who concentrate more on production than marketing.
          <br/>
          Example, The roots of India’s tech entrepreneurship boom extend back to the early 1980s, when a group of software engineers decided to form a business to provide technology services to overseas clients, based on the wide availability and low cost of India’s human talent base. They called their company Infosys (INFY). It became the company that would go on to flatten the world.
          <br/>
          (b)
          <strong>
           Non-technical Entrepreneur:
          </strong>
          Non-technical entrepreneurs are those who are mainly concerned with developing alternative marketing and distribution strategies to promote their business.
          <br/>
          They are not concerned with the technical aspects of the product and services they are dealing with.
          <br/>
          7.
          <strong>
           Professional Entrepreneurs:
          </strong>
<br/>
          • Professional entrepreneurs make it their profession to establish business enterprise, initially they work hard, and put maximum efforts and efficiency get a reputation with a purpose, to sell them once they are established.
          <br/>
          • He/she is always looking forward to develop alternative projects by selling the running business.
          <br/>
          • They are not interested in managing operations of the business established by him. By nature they are dynamic.
          <br/>
          8.
          <strong>
           Motivation:
          </strong>
          Based on their motivating factors, entrepreneurs can be classified into three types such as spontaneous, induced and motivated entrepreneurs.
          <br/>
          (a)
          <strong>
           Spontaneous Entrepreneurs:
          </strong>
          Spontaneous entrepreneurs are otherwise known as pure entrepreneurs, who are motivated by their desire for self-fulfilment and to achieve or prove their excellence in job performance. They undertake entrepreneurial activities for their personal satisfaction in work, ego, or status. Their strength lies in their creative abilities. They are the natural entrepreneurs in any society. They do not need any external motivation.
          <br/>
          (b)
          <strong>
           Induced Entrepreneurs:
          </strong>
          Induced entrepreneurs enter into entrepreneurship because of various governmental supports provided in terms of financial assistance, incentives, concessions and other facilities to the people who want to set up their new enterprises. Sometimes prospective entrepreneurs are induced or even forced by their special circumstance, such as loss of job or inability to find a suitable job according to their talent and merit to adapt to entrepreneurship.
          <br/>
          (c)
          <strong>
           Motivated Entrepreneurs:
          </strong>
          Motivated entrepreneurs are motivated by their desire to make use of their technical and professional expertise and skill in performing the job or project they have taken up. They have enough confidence in their abilities. They are highly ambitious and are normally not satisfied by the slow progress in their jobs. They enter entrepreneurship because of the possibility of making and marketing of some new products or service for the use of the prospective consumers. If the product or service is developed to a saleable stage and the customers accept the same, the entrepreneur is then further motivated by reward in terms of profit.
          <br/>
          McClelland theorized that individuals have three basic motivational needs: affiliation, power and achievement. The affiliation motive can be explained as a strong desire for individual and/or group approval, and it reflects the desire for social acceptance and friendship. The power motive can be satisfied by being in control, and it can be expressed as a strong desire to change events and to exercise influences over others. The achievement motive is based on the need to achieve and win; it is characterized by working hard, and succeeding. For management, all three motives—affiliation, power, and achievement are import when it comes to motivating employees.
          <br/>
          (vi)
          <strong>
           Following are four entrepreneurial competencies:
          </strong>
<br/>
          (a)
          <strong>
           Initiative:
          </strong>
<br/>
          • It is the first step in the enterprise.
          <br/>
          • It is the ability to make decisions and take action without asking for the help or advice of others.
          <br/>
          • It is essential for an entrepreneur to be active quick decision-maker.
          <br/>
          • An entrepreneur has to be keen observer of the society, the commercial trends, the product types, the change dynamics and the consumer trends.
          <br/>
          (b)
          <strong>
           Creativity and Innovation:
          </strong>
<br/>
          • Competency in creativity and innovation are sometimes basic traits of certain individuals.
          <br/>
          • He/she might not have any new ideas.
          <br/>
          • He/she may use the creative ideas and innovative products and services to meet the challenges of a situation, take advantage of the utility of an idea or a product to create wealth. Example, changes in the packaging of potato chips.
          <br/>
          (c)
          <strong>
           Risk Taking and Risk Management:
          </strong>
<br/>
          • Risk refers to the condition of not being able to predict the outcome of an activity or decision. He/she treads into areas of uncertainty.
          <br/>
          • It provides the entrepreneur with a set of controls to monitor the venture.
          <br/>
          • Every entrepreneur must identify the risk, by considering all factors economic conditions, political factors, market research and financial resource mobilization, demand supply in the market, acceptability of the product design and service which throw a potential challenge to the entrepreneur.
          <br/>
          In order to attune oneself in the skill of risk-taking and management he should practice in several areas of entrepreneurial functions such as entering into new market.
          <br/>
          • For example, when Dhirubhai Ambani faced cash crunch he took the risk of issuing shares in 1977 to the public when they were not aware about the share market.
          <br/>
          (d)
          <strong>
           Problem Solving:
          </strong>
<br/>
          Entrepreneur must be aware that he has started a new business and many problems are bound to hinder in the path of progress and he cannot escape from them. He/she should
          <br/>
          • understand that there is more than one way of solving problems,
          <br/>
          look for alternative strategies, resources that would help to solve the problem, generate new ideas, products, services, etc.
          <br/>
          In problem solving an entrepreneur has to take various decisions which should be effective and arriving at creative solution and give better results thereof.
          <br/>
          For example: When an entrepreneur faces cash crunch he should look for alternative sources for receiving funds. Ratan Tata shifted the manufacturing plant of Nano cars from Singur to Sanand due to unforeseen complexities.
          <br/>
          (vii)
          <strong>
           Features of Attitude:
          </strong>
<br/>
          1.
          <strong>
           Affects behaviour:
          </strong>
          People have a natural tendency to maintain consistency between attitude and behaviour. Attitudes can lead to intended behaviour if there is no external intervention.
          <br/>
          2.
          <strong>
           It is invisible:
          </strong>
          It constitutes a psychological phenomenon which cannot be directly observed. However, we may observe an attitude indirectly through observing its consequences. For example, if a person is highly productive, we may infer that he has a positive attitude towards his/her work.
          <br/>
          3.
          <strong>
           Attitudes are acquired:
          </strong>
          Attitudes are gradually learnt over a period of time. The process of learning attitudes starts right from childhood and continues throughout the life of a person. However, in the beginning, the family members have a greater impact on the attitude of a child.
          <br/>
          4.
          <strong>
           Attitudes are pervasive:
          </strong>
          They are formed in the process of socialisation and may relate to anything in the world. For instance, a person may have positive and negative attitudes towards religion, politics, politicians or countries.
          <br/>
          (viii) Systematic means “in an orderly way”. Planning is deciding what action you are going to take in future. All entrepreneurs before going to start an enterprise must make a systematic plan which will help them to prepare an action plan for every area of operation in order to achieve the pre-determined goals and persistence refers a ‘never say die’ attitude, not giving up easily, striving continuously until success is achieved. Entrepreneurs have the determination to persevere in the face of obstacles. Whenever any
          <strong>
           problem arises he takes the following steps:
          </strong>
<br/>
          • Take action in the face of significant obstacles and challenges;
          <br/>
          • Take persistent actions, or switch to an alternative strategy to meet a challenge or obstacle; and
          <br/>
          • Take personal responsibility for the performance necessary to achieve goals and objectives.
          <br/>
          It means after making systematic planning, whenever an entrepreneur faces certain obstacles/barriers in business, he continues in his pursuit of excellence and become an effective leader.

            Answer:
           </strong>
</span>
          (i)The following twelve attitude attributes can put one in the right mindset for achieving entrepreneurial success.
          <br/>
          1. Have passion for the business: Entrepreneur’s should always work with fun and in passion, which will help to overcome difficult moments and he will be able to persuade people to work for him.
          <br/>
          Passion can’t be taught. When it wanes, as it surely will in difficult times, take some quiet time. Whether it be an hour or a week, take inventory of all the reasons one started the business and why one likes being one’s own boss.
          <br/>
          2. Set an example of trustworthiness: Trustworthy entrepreneurs are always welcomed by the people/employees, as they feel confident and want to work for them in a culture of integrity. The same is true for customers.
          <br/>
          3. Be flexible, except with core values: Entrepreneurs make plans and strategies and it will change as time goes on. It is the ability of an enterprise able to anticipate changes in environment, consumer preferences, government policies, fashion and style of living and to adapt to changing circumstances and thus remain a profitable enterprise. A responsible entrepreneur strikes a balance between making profits, flexibility in plans and core values i.e. doing good for their employees, customers, vendors, the environment and other stakeholders.
          <br/>
          4. Don’t let fear of failure hold one back: Failure is an opportunity to learn. All things being equal, venture capitalists would rather invest money in an individual who tried and failed founding a company than in someone who never tried.
          <br/>
          5. Make timely decisions: Failures flow from bad decision, decision-making is like moving from darkness to light, it is creating events and shaping a future. To use one’s intuition is good but procrastination leads one to miss opportunities. So it is suggested to make timely decisions.
          <br/>
          6. The major company asset is oneself: Health is wealth. It means each one should take care of oneself. The most important and valuable asset of an enterprise is health of each people involved in the business. One doesn’t have to choose between one’s family or company, play or work. Maintain one’s own health for balance and energy, which will, in turn, enhance one’s outlook.
          <br/>
          7. Keep one’s ego under control: Don’t take profits and spend them on expensive toys to impress others. Build a war chest for unexpected needs or opportunities. This also means hearing out new ideas and suggestions no matter how crazy they sound.
          <br/>
          8. Believe in oneself: To be a successful entrepreneur one needs to believe in one’s own self, in one’s company, one’s employees, customers, stakeholders, suppliers and must be capable of with everyone with full confidence.
          <br/>
          9. Encourage and accept criticism graciously. Admitting one’s mistakes: An entrepreneur must play a dual role, as he needs to constantly work on convincing one’s employees by encouraging them and other side even when necessary to state their honest opinions wherever required.
          <br/>
          10. Maintain a strong work ethic: When an enterprise is beating other competitors, particularly those who are dealing with the same product or services. As a responsible entrepreneur he must follow the various business ethics and maintain a strong work ethic.
          <br/>
          11. Rebound quickly from setbacks: The entrepreneur should be aware of the obstacles and certain ups and downs which is likely to occur in a business. He must learn and understand it from the setbacks and always try to move ahead.
          <br/>
          12. Periodically getting out of one’s comfort zone to pursue something important: Many times one feels uncomfortable while implementing a needed change in technology, people, mission, competing, etc. For the company and one to grow personally, one sometimes has to step out of one’s comfort zone.
          <br/>
          (ii) Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs
          <br/>
          In 1943, Abraham Maslow developed one of the earliest theories of human motivation, commonly referred to as Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. Maslow’s theory of motivation is called the “hierarchy of needs”. Maslow believes that people would not move down on this list to be motivated by the next set of needs until the previous set(s) had been satisfied.
          <br/>
          Maslow believes that people have five main needs in the following order of importance:
          <br/>

<br/>
          Physiological Needs: are deemed to be the lowest-level needs. These needs include: (a) the need to eat (b) the need to drink (c) the need to work (d) the need to sleep (e) the need to reproduce.
          <br/>
          • As long as physiological needs are unsatisfied, they exist as a driving or motivating force in a person’s life.
          <br/>
          • A hungry person has a felt need. This felt need sets up both psychological and physical tensions that manifest themselves in overt behaviours directed at reducing those tensions (getting something to eat). Once the hunger is stated, the tension is reduced, and the need for food ceases to motivate. At this point (assuming that other physiological requirements are also satisfied) the next higher order need becomes the motivating need.
          <br/>
          Safety Needs: The needs for shelter and security become the motivators of human behaviour. This include the following twelve motivating factors: (1) job security and stability, (2) sympathetic help with personal problems, (3) personal loyalty to employees, (4)interesting work, (5) good working conditions, (6) tactful discipline, (7) good wages, (8) promotions and growth in the organization, (9) feeling of being in on things, (10) full appreciation of work done, (11) freedom from fear and anxiety, and (12) need for structure, order and law.
          <br/>
          In the workplace this needs translates into a need for at least a minimal degree of employment security; the knowledge that we cannot be fired on a whim and that appropriate levels of effort and productivity will ensure continued employment. Social Needs/Belonging Needs include the need for belongingness and love.
          <br/>
          (a) The need to feel part of a group
          <br/>
          (b) The need for acceptance
          <br/>
          • Generally, as gregarious creatures, human have a need to belong.
          <br/>
          • In the workplace, this need may be satisfied by an ability to interact with one’s co-workers and perhaps to be able to work collaboratively with these colleagues.
          <br/>
          Self-Esteem Needs:
          <br/>
          • After social needs have been satisfied, ego and esteem needs become the motivating needs.
          <br/>
          • Esteem needs include the desire for self-respect, self-esteem, and the esteem of others.
          <br/>
          • When focused externally, these needs also include the desire for reputation, prestige, status, fame, glory, dominance, recognition, attention, importance, and appreciation.
          <br/>
          • An individual eventually needs to feel that he/she has a social status. This goes beyond just having social relationships; the individual must feel that in work or at home he/she is making a contribution. This also includes recognition of achievement from others and the need to feel good about themselves.
          <br/>
          Self-actualization Needs/Seif-Realisation Needs:
          <br/>
          This is the final and highest level of needs. Meeting this need is characterized by continuously focusing on personal growth, problem solving, life appreciation, and peak experiences for oneself.
          <br/>
          (i) the need for personal fulfilment
          <br/>
          (ii) the need to grow and develop.
          <br/>
          The need for self-realization, continuous self-development, and the process of becoming all that a person is capable of.
          <br/>
          (iii) See Answer to Q.3 (v).
          <br/>
          (iv) A competency is an attribute, knowledge, skill, ability or other characteristic that contributes to successful job performance to a given task.
          <br/>
          Yes, it is a set of defined behaviours as it can be observable and measurable, it also includes knowledge, skills, abilities, teamwork, cooperation and communication contribute to individual success in the organization. It provides a structured guide enabling the identification, evaluation and development of behaviours in an individual. Entrepreneur should also acquire and follow certain basic competencies. They are as follows:
          <br/>
<img alt="NCERT Solutions for Class 11 Entrepreneurship An Entrepreneur Q5.1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-125451" height="313" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-11-Entrepreneurship-An-Entrepreneur-Q5.1.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-11-Entrepreneurship-An-Entrepreneur-Q5.1.png 417w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-11-Entrepreneurship-An-Entrepreneur-Q5.1-300x225.png 300w" width="417"/>
<br/>
          These relate to the type of behaviour exhibited in the performing of various tasks in the discharge of his functions.
          <br/>
          Some of these competencies are latent in the entrepreneur, which need to be identified, nursed and nurtured. Others are acquired through training and practice.
          <br/>

          In problem solving an entrepreneur has to take various decisions which should be effective and arriving at creative solution and give better results thereof.
          <br/>
          For example: When an entrepreneur faces cash crunch he should look for alternative sources for receiving funds. Ratan Tata shifted the manufacturing plant of Nano cars from Singur to Sanand due to unforeseen complexities.
          <br/>
          Leadership:
          <br/>
          • Leadership is the ability to exert interpersonal influence by means of communication towards the achievement of goals.
          <br/>
          • Entrepreneurs as effective leaders should provide the necessary spark to motivation by guiding, inspiring, assisting and directing the entire team for achievement of unity of action, efforts and purpose.
          <br/>
          • An entrepreneur should also be an effective leader who should be able to guide and motivate his/her entire team.
          <br/>
          • Whenever a company faces problem it is the will power and effective business acumen and communication skills, sense of confidence and conviction which oversees the success of the corporation.

          • Creating a need in the market for the enterprise is one of the main requirements of the entrepreneur. This calls for intense perseverance on the part of the entrepreneur. Failures or Roadblocks to success should not deter the entrepreneur. For example:(a) Mixers when introduced, did not have many customers but today, we find it to be an essential part of kitchen accessories.
          <br/>
          (b) When Mahima Mehra brought out her product – Haathi Chaap, she had experimented on various other material before using elephant dung to manufacture hand-made paper.
          <br/>

          <br/>
          One develops the skill of comparing the quality of the product/services with certain standards, which he/she himself evolves or are set by others.
          <br/>
          For example: Steve Jobs, the brain behind Apple and I-pod, is known to value quality in all the products introduced by the company.
          <br/>
          Information Seeking:
          <br/>
          • Information plays a very crucial role at every stage of enterprise building and management. An entrepreneur has an urge to look for the required information in order to make an informed decision.

          <br/>
          • All these require skill of persuation and convincing and have to practice highlighting the strong points of their products and services in the market explaining the technological competencies of their enterprise to produce quality goods and services.
          <br/>
          Enterprise Launching Competencies: Opportunities exist, but not all people respond to them. Large groups in society can perceive only the apparent and traditional openings of earning.
          <br/>
          At the same time, resources are also available to all members of the society, but very few make efforts to ensure best use of these resources.
          <br/>
          Entrepreneurs should identify and avail the facilities and resources needed to launch their enterprises.
          <br/>
          Enterprise Management Competencies: The enterprise may be small or big but it demands management abilities on the part of its owner or manager.

          (v) Entrepreneur’s decision can strengthen a firm’s future business viability, by following some ethical standards in their business practices:
          <br/>
          (а) Providing quality and correct quantity of goods to consumers
          <br/>
          (b) Keeping in mind the environmental issues during production
          <br/>
          (c) Paying the minimum and correct wages to the workers
          <br/>
          (d) Not to use child labour in their production
          <br/>
          (e) Judicious use of natural resources.
          <br/>
          (f) Integrity, promise keeping, commitment, and truthfulness towards employee, consumers other competitors, etc.
          <br/>
          For example: Karsan Bhai Patel, the creator of Nirma Washing Powder, who was working as a factory chemist in Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation, started making detergent powder in his kitchen for poor rural women of Gujarat and selling his product by visiting different villages. His efforts culminated in the whitish yellow detergent powder named Nirma. The idea behind was need and the problem of the society that could not afford other brands of detergent powders because of their high cost. Today, Nirma is one of the world’s biggest detergent powder manufacturer. The strength of being capable is the plus point in an entrepreneur.
          <br/>
          Entrepreneurs make choices and take actions that affect many, usually without the moral guidance available in established organisations. “Entrepreneur’s decisions can seriously weaken a firm’s future business viability.” Some common types of unethical action by an enterprise or an entrepreneur.
          <br/>
          • Theft, manipulating suppliers, bribery, embezzlement, evading taxes, failure to
          <br/>
          withdraw a defective product from the marketplace, adulteration, stealing supplies, falsification, etc.
          <br/>
          For example: The cases of Enron, World Com are the examples of results of unethical decisions by key personnel of those enterprises. For example: The collapse of Enron is a scandal of a major energy provider that used to be the seventh largest corporation in America and became the biggest bankruptcy in the US corporate history. Unethical issues are:
          <br/>
          • Enron used many manipulative accounting practices,
          <br/>
          • Sophisticated accounting techniques to keep its share price high,
          <br/>
          • Raise investment against its own assets,
          <br/>
          • Artificially inflated profits, questionable accounting practices and fraud.
          <br/>
          For example: Ramalinga Raju. We all are aware of the fraud at Satyam – a case of unethical practice.

          <br/>
          All those entrepreneurs who is following the ethics and moral responsibility towards society is an asset for society and should be survive and grow.
          <br/>
          Examples of such entrepreneurs:
          <br/>
          • Parker brothers withdrew its best selling toy, when children were chocked to death by swallowing some parts of the toy and remain successful for long term.
          <br/>
          • Nandita Bijur owner of Uma Food Products, an enterprise worth several crores of rupees.
          <br/>
          • Karsan Bhai Patel, creator of Nirma Washing powder.

          <br/>
          Their ethical value system provided them with rational economic attitude and successful entrepreneurs of the world.
          <br/>
          (iv) Type of competency is shown here is Problem Solving.
          <br/>
          Competency relates to the type of behaviour exhibited in the performing of various tasks in the discharge of his functions. These competencies are latent in the entrepreneur, which need to be identified and acquire by which he should be able to face the problems with attention confidence and conviction. In the business world, problem solvers take risk but often create value by solving a problem related to, within a business or outside business like customer, market-key to creating a profitable enterprise. The more or larger problems an entrepreneurial organization solves, the more profit it can generate.
          <br/>
          A business entrepreneur Ratan Tata is a person who had undertaken some effort with risk for the benefit of others. He was aware that, the venture he started was established on a new area and he has taken certain calculated risks, he was also aware
          <br/>
          of, that many problems are bound to come in the path of progress, during that time only taken a firm decision and when any problems like unforeseen complexities had come in the path of progress, then only he had taken a firm decision and shifted the manufacturing plant for Nano Cars from Singur to Sanand.
          <br/>
          It clearly shows that most of the entrepreneur identified and understand the problem, find more than one ways for solving problems and, look for alternative strategies or resources that would help to solve the problem, generate new ideas, products, services, etc. At last, He has taken an entrepreneurial action with systematic efforts to solve problems.
          <br/>
          (v) Raju falls in Safety Needs as propounded by Maslow in his Motivational Theory. Reason: In the workplace this needs translates into a need for at least a minimal degree of employment security; the knowledge that we cannot be fired on a whim and that appropriate levels of effort and productivity will ensure continued employment.

<strong>
           Features of attitude:
          </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
           Attitude affects behaviour: People have a natural tendency to maintain consistency between attitude and behaviour. Attitudes can lead to intended behaviour if there is no external intervention.
          </li>
<li>
           It is invisible: It constitutes a psychological phenomenon which cannot be directly
           <br/>
           observed. However, we may observe an attitude indirectly through observing its
           <br/>
           consequences. For example, if a person is highly productive, we may infer that he has a positive attitude towards his/her work.
          </li>
<li>
           Attitudes are acquired: Attitudes are gradually learnt over a period of time. The process of learning attitudes starts right from childhood and continues throughout the life of a person. However, in the beginning, the family members have a greater impact on the attitude of a child.
          </li>
<li>
           Attitudes are pervasive: They are formed in the process of socialisation and may relate to anything in the world. For instance a person may have positive and negative attitudes towards religion, politics, politicians or countries.

          As a manager, I will take the following steps to motivate these employees to accomplish the desired target of an organisation.
          <br/>
          McClelland’s Acquired Needs Theory—needs are to some extent acquired and can therefore be influenced, just as several simultaneous needs influence a person’s behaviour.
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Start with some team building exercises.
          </li>
<li>
           Without hiring an outside consulting company as they are costly and do not know your company the way you do. Get your employees involved in your decision-making process. They will feel happy and great with you and your company with full responsibility and work enthusiastically.
          </li>
<li>
           As a group have your employees brainstorm ideas for workplace values and ethics. Then be sure they each have a copy of the values they come up with.
          </li>
<li>
           Recognize their accomplishments and listen to their ideas. Give them awards for their accomplishments. Let them make the decision about who gets the award.
          </li>
<li>
           Incentives: Offering incentives, be it in the form of cash bonuses, promotions or even physical rewards, is a great way to make them work and get your employees eager to meet their goals.
          </li>
<li>
           Lead with trust: To get the best from his team members, the leader needs to have their trust. You must become that General and get your team to believe in whatever goals you set. Now, lead them into battle.
          </li>
<li>
           Be Nice to People: Too many bosses think of their staff as numbers and robots instead of humans. Treat your team as you would your family and friends and you’ll see how quickly they respond and put their best feet forward.
          </li>

          Maslow’s theory relates motivation to a hierarchy of needs. At the bottom are essential physiological needs such as air, food, shelter and clothing. As individuals satisfy one level of need, their motivations change as they aspire to reach the higher order needs. Therefore, to motivate an individual Maslow suggests that it is necessary to know where within the hierarchy each employee is placed so that these factors can be taken into account. Within enterprise every employee is motivated to work through each of these levels.
