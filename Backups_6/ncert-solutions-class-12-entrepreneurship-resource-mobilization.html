           <br/>
           • Preference shares: Dividend is payable on these shares at a fixed rate and is payable only if there are profits. Hence, there is no compulsory burden on the company’s finances. Such shares do not give voting rights.

           <br/>
           • The time given to accept the right offer should not be less than 15 days.

           • The circular/notice issued to the shareholder must state the right of the shareholder to renounce the offer in favour of others.
           <br/>
           • After the expiry of the time mentioned in the notice, the Board of Directors has the right to dispose the unsubscribed shares in any manner as per the benefit of the company.

But last week the heading was different that Sensex goes down now some confusion was going on her mind, immediately she asked her Friend Rahil the same? Now according to you how Rahil will clear the confusion of Anushk? Explain and give some value points.

<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
            Answer
           </strong>
</span>
          . Rahil explains him in this way: The Sensex is an “index”.
          <br/>
          An index is basically an indicator. It gives you a general idea about whether most of the stocks have gone up or most of the stocks have gone down.
          <br/>
          The Sensex is an indicator of all the major listed companies of the BSE.
          <br/>
          The BSE, is the Bombay Stock Exchange and the NSE is the National Stock Exchange. The BSE is situated at Bombay and the NSE is situated at Delhi. These are the major stock exchanges in the country.
          <br/>
          If the Sensex goes up, it indicates that the prices of the stocks (shares) of most of the major companies on the BSE have gone up.
          <br/>
          If the Sensex goes down, this tells you that the stock price of most of the major stocks on the BSE have gone down.
          <br/>
          In this way Rahil cleared the confusion
          <br/>
          of Anushk.

<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
            Answer
           </strong>
</span>
          . SEBI has quasi-legislative capacity as it makes rules and regulations. It has rule-making authority related to the matters of securities in India.
          <br/>
          SEBI is a quasi-judicial body as it has an entity such as an arbitrator or tribunal board, and has powers and procedures resembling those of a court. SEBI is quasi-executive as it functions like an executive but that is not really an executive.

This can be due to economic instability or issues relating to the asset. If the asset value declines, it becomes an illiquid asset due to the unclear value. It can be hard to locate a market for these products. This may lead to loss of the money.

           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
            Answer
           </strong>
</span>
          . Yes, to start with a small scale industries for manufacturing and selling is really a tough job in this competitive world where already many other detergent manufacturing units are there. Detergents are also known as synthetic detergents. They are different from oil-based soap though both soaps and detergents are surfactants. There are a number of varieties of detergents varying in percentages of active matter present in them and also different colours. Manufacturing process is very simple and only mixing is involved. Hence, this product is best suited for manufacturing in small-scale sector.
          <br/>
          An entrepreneur can seek support from various financial institutions and others.

<strong>
            Angle Investors:
           </strong>
<br/>
           • Business angle or an angle investor is an affluent individual who provides capital for a business start-up and early stage companies having a high- risk, high-return matrix usually in exchange for convertible debt or ownership equity.
           <br/>
           • Apart from investing funds, most angles provide proactive advice, guidance, industry connections and mentoring start-ups in its early days.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Venture Capitalist:
           </strong>
<br/>
           • Venture capital is an equity based investment in a growth-oriented small to medium business to enable the investors to accomplish objectives, in return for minority shareholding in the business or the irrevocable right to acquire.
           <br/>
           • The private equity capital provided as funding to early-stage, high potential, high risk, growth up companies/entrepreneurs who lack the necessary experience and funds to give shape to their ideas.
           <br/>
           • Accordingly, it is more accurate to view and go for venture capital broadly as a professionally managed pool of equity capital.
           <br/>
           • Venture capital is a way in which investors support entrepreneurial talent with finance and business skills to exploit market opportunities and obtain long-term capital gains.

          <br/>
          As per the SEBI guidelines, if the company does not receive 90% of the issue amount from the public subscription including development from underwriters within 120 days from the date of the issue, the amount of subscription received is required to be refunded to the applications. In case of disputed development also, subscription is required to be refunded if 90% of the issued amount plus accepted. Development from underwriters if any is not received within 120 days of the issue of prospectus, all the money received from the applicants for shares is required to be repaid forthwith without interest and if any such money is not so repaid in the next 10 days (after the expiry of 120 days), the directors of the company are jointly and severally liable to repay that money, with interest from the expiry of the 130 days.

           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
            Answer
           </strong>
</span>
          .
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           Yes, the behaviour of the manager is unethical because rights issue is a method of raising additional finance from existing shareholders by offering securities to them on prorate basis i.e. giving them a right to a certain number of shares in proportion to the shares they are holding.
          </li>
<li>
           As a legal advisor of the company, I advice that he should not be given that right of extra shares.
          </li>
<li>
           As a manager his responsibility is to develop and analyse information

           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
            Answer
           </strong>
</span>
          .The term ‘venture capital’ is defined as a equity by which an investor supports an entrepreneur talent with finance and business skills to exploit market opportunities and thus obtain a longterm market gains. These are investors and investment companies whose specialty is financing new, high potential, high- technology oriented entrepreneurial ventures.
          <br/>
          The mode of raising funds through venture capitalists:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           They are more interested in financing ventures which are in their second or third stage of development .
          </li>
<li>
           They often provide initial equity investment to start up a business such ventures can be of software, biotechnology, high-potential ventures, high-technology ventures or are venture having high potential prospects and returns expected.
          </li>
<li>
           Venture capitalists look for a high rate of return. Thus, they want equity, or some share of ownership in return for their capital.
          </li>
<li>
           They are willing to take the higher risk of losing their capital for a chance of profit from the business’s success.
          </li>
<li>
           The venture capitalist sells his or her percentage of the business to either another investor or back to the entrepreneur after specific number of years association or when he finds returns lowering down.
          </li>
<li>

          </li>
<li>
           These investors have a deep insight about the fields in which they make their investment, but they behave like more or less as non-working partners do not interfere in the management of the enterprise but protect them at initial stage by keeping good contact with them.
          </li>
<li>
           Venture capitalists are more careful while investing in any venture as they know that investment is highly illiquid. It means it is not subject to repayment on demand.

           Raising loans from friends and relatives
          </li>
<li>

          </li>
<li>
           Borrowing from finance companies.
          </li>
</ol>
<p>
<span style="color: #993366;">
<strong>
            Question 5. Companies can raise finance by a number of methods. What are the methods to raise long-term and medium-term capital finance?
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
            Answer
           </strong>
</span>
          .
          <strong>
           Issue of Shares:
          </strong>
          It is the most important method. The liability of shareholders is limited to the face value of shares, and they are also easily transferable. A private company cannot invite the general public to subscribe for its share capital and its shares are also not freely transferable. But for public limited companies there are no such restrictions. There are two types of shares:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
            Equity shares:
           </strong>
           The rate of dividend on these shares depends on the profits available and the discretion of directors. Hence, there is no fixed burden on the company. Each share carries one vote.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Preference shares:
           </strong>
           Dividend is payable on these shares at a fixed rate and is payable only if there are profits. Hence, there is no compulsory burden on the company’s finances. Such shares do not give voting rights.
          </li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
           Issue of Debentures:
          </strong>
          Companies generally have powers to borrow and raise loans by issuing debentures. The rate of interest payable on debentures is fixed at the time of issue and are recovered by a charge on the property or assets of the company, which provide the necessary security for payment- The company is liable to pay interest even if there are no profits. Debentures are mostly issued to finance the long-term requirements of business and do not carry any voting rights.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Loans from Financial Institutions:
          </strong>
          Long-term and medium-term loans can be secured by companies from financial institutions like the Industrial Finance Corporation of India, Industrial ; Credit and Investment Corporation of India (ICICI), State level Industrial Development Corporations, etc. These financial institutions grant loans for a maximum period of 25 years against approved schemes or projects. Loans agreed to be sanctioned must be covered by securities by way of mortgage of the company’s property or assignment of stocks, shares, gold, etc.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Loans from Commercial Banks:
          </strong>
          Medium-term loans can be raised by companies from commercial banks against the security of properties and assets. Funds required for modernisation and renovation of assets can be borrowed from banks. This method of financing does not require any legal formality except that of creating a mortgage on the assets.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Public Deposits:
          </strong>
          Companies often raise funds by inviting their shareholders, employees and the general public to deposit their savings with the company. The Companies Act permits such deposits to be received for a period up to 3 years at a time. Public deposits can be raised by companies to meet their medium-term as well as short-term financial needs. The increasing popularity of public deposits is due to:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           The rate of interest the companies have to pay on them is lower than the interest on bank loans.
          </li>
<li>
           These are easier methods of mobilising funds than banks, especially during periods of credit squeeze.
          </li>
<li>
           They are unsecured.
          </li>
<li>
           Unlike commercial banks,the company does not need to satisfy credit-worthiness for securing loans.
          </li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
           Reinvestment of Profits:
          </strong>
          Profitable companies do not generally distribute the whole amount of profits as dividend but, transfer certain proportion to reserves. This may be regarded as reinvestment of profits or ploughing back of profits. As these retained profits actually belong to the shareholders of the company, these are treated as a part of ownership capital. Retention of profits is a sort of self financing of business. The reserves built up over the years by ploughing back of profits may be utilised by the company for the following purposes:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           Expansion of the undertaking
          </li>
<li>
           Replacement of obsolete assets and modernisation.
          </li>
<li>
           Meeting permanent or special working capital requirement.
          </li>
<li>
           Redemption of old debts.
          </li>
<li>
           It enables the company to adopt a stable dividend policy.
          </li>
</ol>
<p>

           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
            Answer
           </strong>
</span>
          . Entrepreneurs can typically seek venture capital to assist at any of the following four stages in the company’s development:
          <br/>
          (i) Early stage financing this stage includes:
          <br/>
          (a) Seed capital
          <br/>
          (b) Pre-start up and start up
          <br/>
          (c) Second-round financing
         </p>
<p>
          (a) Seed capital finance:
          <br/>
          • It refers to the capital required by an entrepreneur for conducting research at pre-commercialization stage.
          <br/>
          • During this stage, the entrepreneur has to convince the investor (VC) why his idea/product is worthwhile.
          <br/>
          • The investor will investigate into the technical and economical feasibility of the idea.
          <br/>
          • In some cases, there is some.sort of prototype of the idea/product that is not fully developed or tested.
          <br/>
          • As the risk element at this stage is very high, investor (VC) may deny to assist if he does not see any potential in the idea.
          <br/>
          • Entrepreneur’s ability, technological skills and competencies are required to match with the market opportunities so as to successfully convince about product/idea’s feasibility to the venture capitalist.
          <br/>
          (b) Start up finance:
          <br/>
          • If the idea/product/process is qualified for further investigation and/or investment, the process will go to the second stage; this is also called the start-up stage.
          <br/>
          • A business plan is presented by the entrepreneur to the VC firm. A management team is being formed to run the venture.
          <br/>
          • If the company has a board of directors, a person from the VC firms will take seats at the board of directors.
          <br/>
          • While the organisation is being set up, the idea/product gets its form.
          <br/>
          • The prototype is being developed and fully tested.
          <br/>
          • Sometimes, clients are being attracted for initial sales. The management-team stablishes a feasible production line to produce the product.
          <br/>
          • The VC firm monitors the feasibility of the product and the capability of the management-team from the board of directors.
          <br/>
          (c) Second-round financing:
          <br/>
          • At this stage, the time comes the idea has been transformed into a product and is being produced and sold.
          <br/>
          • This is the first encounter with the rest of the market, the competitors and attempt is to squeeze in the market and get some market share from the competitors.
          <br/>
          • The entrepreneur, at this stage, needs assistance from the Venture Capitalist for expansion, modernization, diversification so that the economies of scale and stability could be attained.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Last stage financing/bridge/pre-public stage: In general, this is the last stage of the venture capital financing process. The main goal of this stage is for the venture to go public so that investors can exit the venture with a profit commensurate with the risk they have taken.
          <br/>
          At this stage, the venture achieves a certain amount of market share. This gives the venture some opportunities for example:
          <br/>
          • Merger with other companies.
          <br/>
          • Keeping new competitors away from the market.
          <br/>
          • Eliminate competitors.
          <br/>
          • Development capital.

<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
            Answer
           </strong>
</span>
          . Yes, I agree with the statement. Stock market contributes to better allocation of capital and intensifies capital formation. The shares of profit making companies are quoted at higher prices and are actively traded so such companies can easily raise fresh capital from stock market. The general public hesitates to invest in securities of loss making companies. So stock exchange facilitates allocation of investor’s fund to profitable channels. Stock exchange intensifies the process of capital formation through creating the habit of saving, investing and risk taking among the investing class by converting their savings into profitable, safe investments.

           .Advantages of Franchising:
          </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
            Proven idea:
           </strong>
           Business is based on a proven idea. Success of the product can be checked in the market.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Profit from brand recognition:
           </strong>
           Franchises develop an image in the marketplace. This saves both time and money of advertising, promotion, recognition, etc. Image of the product is a favourable one and is in the minds of consumers.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Recognized brand name and trademarks:
           </strong>
           Entrepreneur gets a recognized brand name and trademarks. Benefit from any advertising or promotion by the parent company automatically benefits the franchise.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Support from parent company:
           </strong>
           The franchisor gives support in the form of training, help setting up the business, a manual telling how to run the business and ongoing advice.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Exclusive rights of the territory:
           </strong>
           The franchisor can’t sell any other franchises in the same territory which leads to the creation of monopoly power in the territory.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Easier Financing:
           </strong>
           Financing the business becomes easier due to the associated brand name. Banks are more likely to lend money to buy a franchise with a good reputation.
