          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The secondary or anamnestic immune response is based on the memory of primary response, i.e. first encounter with an antigen. Due to this, the second generated immune response is more fast and have higher affinity for antigen and therefore, it is more intense than primary immune response in humans.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The allergen can be pollen grains, spores or dust particles. When the allergens are inhaled or enter body system, they stimulate body to produce IgE antibodies and trigger an antiallergic reaction. The chemicals such as histamine and serotonin are released from mast cells in response to allergen, thereby causing dilation of blood vessels. These chemicals also elicit inflammatory response that may result in sneezing, watery eyes, running nose, etc.

          Question 34.
          <br/>
          How does a vaccine for a particular disease immunise the human body against that disease? (Delhi 2013C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          During vaccination for a particular disease, an antigen or antigenic protein or weak pathogen, which is in inactive form is introduced into the body to induce mild immune response.
         </p>
<p>
          The vaccine generates antibodies that neutralises the toxin/pathogen and produces memory-B or T-cells, which recognise the pathogen in the subsequent encounters and produce antibodies.

          Question 48.
          <br/>
          How is an allergic reaction caused by an allergen? Name the drug that can reduce the symptoms of allergy? (All India 2011C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          An allergic reaction is caused by allergens as these can produce IgE type of antibodies. These antibodies causes the release of histamine and serotonin like chemicals from mast cells, which cause allergic reactions. The use of drugs like antihistamine, adrenaline and steroids quickly reduce the symptoms of allergy.

          (ii) How can we get immunisation against tetanus? (All India 2010)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) In vaccination, a preparation of antigenic proteins of pathogen or inactivated/ weakened pathogen (vaccine) are introduced into the body. The antibodies produced in the body against these antigens would neutralise the pathogenic agents during actual infection. The vaccines also generate memory-B and T-cells.
          <br/>
          (ii) Preformed antibodies for tetanus are directly injected to acquire quick immune response. This is called passive immunisation against tetanus.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Normal cells do not show cancerous growth as
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Their growth and division are regulated by certain regulatory mechanisms.
          </li>
<li>
           They show the property of contact inhibition, by virtue of which contact with other cells inhibit their uncontrolled growth.
          </li>

<p>
          Question 58.
          <br/>
          State the effect of carcinogens on human body. Name the carcinogenic ionising and non-ionising radiations. Mention their carcinogenic effects. (All India 2010C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Carcinogens can transform normal cell into cancerous cells.
          <br/>
          Carcinogenic ionising radiations are X-rays and gamma rays. Carcinogenic non-ionising radiations are UV-rays.
          <br/>
          These radiations cause changes in base sequences, i.e. mutations that lead to transformation of normal cells into cancerous cell.

          Question 61.
          <br/>
          (i) What precaution(s) would you recommend to a patient requiring repeated blood transfusion?
          <br/>
          (ii) If the advise is not followed by the patient there is an apprehension that the patient might contract a disease that would destroy the immune system of his/her body. Explain with the help of schematic diagram only how the immune system would get affected and destroyed. (Delhi 2017)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) Repeated blood transfusion may result in contracting diseases like AIDS. The recipient must ensure that the donor’s blood is being screened for HIV and other pathogens. Also, he should make sure that doctors are using fresh needles.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) In the absence of such measures, the patient can get infected by HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), which causes AIDS. It is a threatening disorder that weakens the immune system by attacking helper T-cells in the body.

          Question 62.
          <br/>
          (i) It is generally observed that the children who had suffered from chickenpox in their childhood may not contract the same disease in their adulthood.
          <br/>
          Explain giving reasons the basis of such an immunity in an individual. Name this kind of immunity.
          <br/>
          (ii) What are interferons? Mention their role. (Foreign 2016)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) A child who had suffered from chickenpox in childhood may not contract disease in his/her adulthood. It is because during the first encounter with pathogen (chickenpox) specific antibodies (by humoral immune response) are produced to counter the attack. During this attack, memory cells are also produced. Due to this, on subsequent exposure to the same pathogen, the immune response is more rapid and intense. That is why, second exposure to the chickenpox does not cause disease. It is known as acquired immunity of the body.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Interferons are special kind of proteins secreted by virus infected cells. These protect the healthy cells from the virus attacks.

          Question 64.
          <br/>
          State the three characteristics of acquired immunity. List the different ways by which it can be attained by humans. (Delhi 2016C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The characteristics of acquired immunity are
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           It is pathogen specific.
          </li>
<li>
           It is characterised by memory.
          </li>
<li>
           Responses can be characterised as a primary response (of low intensity) and secondary response.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          Acquired immunity can be attained by humans in the following ways
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Active immunity The antibodies are produced in the host body as a response to foreign entitities, i.e. on living microbes or other proteins. The onset of response is slow.
          </li>
<li>
           Passive immunity The readymade antibodies are directly introduced to protect the body against foreign agents.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          Question 65.
          <br/>
          How are primary and secondary immune responses carried out in the human body? Explain. (Delhi 2016C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The primary response is the first response of immune system to a newly introduced foreign agent, while a second intensified immune response to same foreign agent is the secondary or anamnestic response. Immune responses are produced by two types of lymphocytes
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           B-Iymphocytes These produce an army of proteins in response to pathogens, i.e. antibodies in the blood. The different types of antibodies secreted are IgA, IgM, IgE and IgG. This response generated via antibodies of the immune system is also called the humoral immune response.
          </li>
<li>
           T-lymphocytes are the mediators of the cell-mediated immunity (CMI). The cell-mediated immune response is responsible for the graft rejection.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          Question 66.
          <br/>
          (i) HIV and Hepatitis-B are STDs. Mention the two other ways by which they can be transmitted to a healthy person.
          <br/>
          (ii) Why is early detection of STD essential? What can it lead to otherwise? Explain. (Delhi 2016C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) STDs like AIDS and hepatitis-B can be transmitted to a healthy person in the following ways
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Unsafe blood transfusion.
          </li>
<li>
           From infected mother to foetus throught lactation.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          (ii) Early detection of STD is essential for timely cure. Otherwise this can lead to Pelvic Inflammatory Diseases (PIDs), abortions or even cancer of the reproductive tract. (IVi)

          Question 67.
          <br/>
          A youth in his twenties met with an accident and succumbed to the injuries. His parents agreed to donate his organs. List any two essential clinical steps to be undertaken before any organ transplant. Why is the transplant rejected sometimes? What views would you share with your health club members to promote organ donation? (Delhi 2015C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Organ transplantation involves the removal of damaged/injured tissues or organs from the body of a person and their substitution by similar tissues/organs from a donor. Tissue matching, blood group matching are essential clinical steps before undertaking any graft/transplant. Transplantation may result in the rejection of transplanted organs as the immune system recognises the protein in the transplanted tissue or organs as foreign and initiates cellular immunity. We should raise and promote awareness about organ donation, about need of organ and tissue donors. There are lakhs of people waiting for organ donation and many people die daily while waiting for transplant. Organs and tissues from one donor can save upto 40-50% lives. So, we should encourage and get registered for organ donation to save many lives.

          (i) State what happens in the human body when malarial parasites infected RBCs burst to release the parasites in the blood.
          <br/>
          (ii) Mention the specific sites in the host body, where production of
          <br/>
          (a) sporzoites and
          <br/>
          (b) gametocytes takes place in the life cycle of the malarial parasites. (Delhi 2015C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) When the RBCs infected with malarial parasites burst open, they release a toxic substance called haemozoin, which is responsible for the chill and high fever recurring every three to four days.
          <br/>
          (ii) (a) Sporozoites They are produced in the gut (inside oocyte on the surface of stomach) of the female Anopheles mosquitoes.

          Question 70.
          <br/>
          Mention any two human diseases caused by round worms. Name their causative agents and their mode of transmission into the human body. (All India 2015C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Roundworms are nematodes, that cause helminthic disease in humans.
          <br/>
          Two human diseases caused by roundworms are
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Ascariasis It is caused by intestinal endoparasite of humans, Ascaris lumbricoides. Infection occurs through contaminated vegetables, fruits and water.
          </li>
<li>
           Filariasis It is caused by filarial worms, Wuchereria bancrofti and W. malayi. It is transmitted by the bite of female Culex mosquito.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          Question 71.
          <br/>
          At what stage is Plasmodium picked up by the female Anopheles? Describe the life cycle of the parasite in this insect. (Delhi 2015C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Female Anopheles pick up Plasmodium at gametocyte stage from human body.
          <br/>
          Inside mosquito’s body, the gametocytes develop to form male and female gametes. These gametes fuse and form zygote, which further divides to form many sporozoites in the intestine of mosquito. These sporozoites later move into salivary glands. See text on page no. 206.

          (iii) Name the disease against which this injection was given and the kind of immunity it provides. (All India 2015)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) The doctor must have injected the tetanus vaccine into the patient.
          <br/>
          (ii) The vaccine injection stimulates the body to make antibodies against the tetanus toxin.
          <br/>
          (iii) The disease is tetanus, which is caused by bacterium Clostridium tetani. It may enter the skin through a cut or puncture wound. Once bacteria is under the skin, it makes a toxin that causes severe and painful muscle spasms, which can even be fatal. The injection provides passive immunity.

          (a) present in colostrum.
          <br/>
          (b) produced in response to allergens in human body. (Foreign 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) The immunity provided to the newborn by colostrum and vaccinations is called passive immunity.
         </p>
<p>
          This is because both in colostrum and vaccines the antibodies conferred are not produced by own body, but are rather transferred passively to recipient’s body. Such as IgA antibodies pass through milk (colostrum) to infants and provides passive immunity against infection.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) (a) The type of antibody present in colostrum is IgA.
          <br/>

          Or
          <br/>
          Trace the events occur in human body to cause immunodeficiency, when HIV gains entry into the body. (Delhi 2011)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The HIV virus attacks the macrophages first in human body. The further replication of virus causes immuno deficiency in the following way
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           RNA is replicated to form viral DNA by the enzyme reverse transcriptase.
          </li>
<li>
           Viral DNA gets incorporated into the host cell’s DNA and directs the infected cells to produce viruses.
          </li>
<li>
           Macrophages continue to produce virus particles and function as HIV factories.
          </li>
<li>
           The virus particles enter helper T-lymphocytes in the blood, where they continue to replicate and produce viral progenies.
          </li>
<li>
           The number of helper T-lymphocytes progressively decreases in the body of the infected person.
          </li>
<li>
           With the decrease in number of T-cells, the immunity also decreases. The person is unable to produce any immune response even against common bacteria like Mycobacterium, parasites like Toxoplasma, viruses and fungi.
          </li>
</ul>

          Question 83.
          <br/>
          (i) All human beings have cellular oncogenes, but only few suffer from cancer disease. Give reasons.
          <br/>
          (ii) How is a malignant tumour different from a benign tumour? (Foreign 2010)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) Ail cells have cellular oncogenes (c-onc) or proto-oncogene, but only few suffer from cancer disease because these genes code for certain growth factors. Under certain conditions, they get activated and lead to oncogenic transformation causing cancer. This transformation is induced by physical, chemical and biological factors called carcinogens.

          Question 85.
          <br/>
          (i) Cancer is one of the most dreaded diseases. Explain ‘contact inhibition’ and ‘metastasis’ with respect to disease.
          <br/>
          (ii) Name the group of genes that have been identified in normal cells that could lead to cancer. How do these genes cause cancer?
          <br/>
          (iii) Name any two techniques that are useful in detecting cancers of internal organs.
          <br/>
          (iv) Why are cancer patients often given a-interferon as part of the treatment? (Delhi 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) Contact inhibition is the property exhibited by normal cells. It prevents their uncontrolled proliferation when they are in contact with other neighbouring cells. But cancerous cells seem to have lost this property and continue to divide despite being in contact with other cells, which leads to masses of cells called tumours.
         </p>
<p>
          Metastasis is the property exhibited by malignant tumours which grows rapidly, invades neighbouring tissues and is capable of reaching distant sites through blood and lymph thus, spreading malignant tumours to other organs or parts of body. These two properties make ‘cancer’ one of the dreaded diseases.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) The group of genes called cellular oncogenes or proto-oncogenes in normal cells could lead to cancer. These genes are present in inactivated or suppressed form. Some factors, i.e. physical, chemical or biological called carcinogens are capable of activating these oncogenes and thus, transforming normal cells into cancerous one.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) The two techniques useful in detecting cancers of internal organs, are CT (Computed Tomography) and MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging).
         </p>
<p>
          (iv) As tumour cells are capable of avoiding recognition and destruction by immune system, the cancer patients are given a-interferons, which are biological response modifiers. It helps in activating the immune system and destroy tumours.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 86.
          <br/>
          (i) Name and explain any four lymphoid organs present in humans.
          <br/>
          (ii) Categorise the named lymphoid organs as primary or secondary lymphoid organs, giving reasons. (Foreign 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) The four lymphoid organs are:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Bone marrow Major lymphoid organs as both B and T-lymphocytes are formed here and p-lymphocytes mature here only.
          </li>
<li>
           Thymus T-lymphocytes mature in thymus and they are responsible for cell mediated iinmupe response.
          </li>
<li>
           Spleen Bean-shaped organ comprising of single mass of lymphoid tissues. In foetal stage, it produces all type of blood cells but only lymphocytes are produced in adult stage.
          </li>
<li>
           Lymph nodes These are small solid structures composed of lymphoid tissue. They produce lymphocytes and plasma cells and also act as filters for lymph.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          (ii) The above described lymphoid organs, such as bone marrow and thymus can be grouped under primary lymphoid organs, because these act as organs where both B and T-lymphocytes mature and acquire their antigenic specificity. Whereas the spleen and lymph nodes are considered as secondary lymphoid organs where the lymphocytes undergo proliferation and differentiation. These are the site of acquired immune response to antigens and formation of effector cells.
         </p>

          (ii) List the possible preventive measures that you would suggest to the residents of your locality in a meeting organised by you so that they understand the situation.
          <br/>
          (iii) Write the symptoms and the causative agent of AIDS. (All India 2013)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) AIDS is not contagious, i.e: it does not spread by shaking hand, talking and use of common utensils. So, there is no need of fear to live with the AIDS patient.
          <br/>
          (ii) Some preventive and safe steps to be suggested are:
         </p>
<ul>

          <br/>
          (ii) Heroin is a depressant and slows down body function.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 92.
          <br/>
          Why are adolescents especially advised not to smoke? How does smoking affect the functioning of the body? (Outside Delhi 2016C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Adolescents are advised not to smoke for the following reasons
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Smoking paves way for hard drugs.
          </li>
<li>
           Smoking is associated with increased incidences of cancers of lung, throat and bronchitis and emphysema. It also increases carbon monoxide content in blood and reduces the concentration of haem-bound oxygen.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          Question 93.
          <br/>
          Name two drugs obtained from poppy plant. ‘These drugs are medically useful, but are often abused’. Taking the mentioned examples justify by giving reasons. (Delhi 2016 C)
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          How are morphine and heroin related? Mention the effect each one of them has on the human body? (All India 2014C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Both morphine and heroin are extracted from the latex of plant Papaver somniferum.
          <br/>
          Heroin is actually obtained by the acetylation of morphine. Thus, both heroine and morphine are related.
          <br/>
          Morphine acts as an effective sedative and pain-killer while heroin acts as depressant and slows down body functions.

<p>
          Question 98.
          <br/>
          Why is tobacco smoking associated with rise in blood pressure and emphysema (oxygen deficiency in the body)? Explain. (All India 2011)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The nicotine present in tobacco stimulates
          <br/>
          adrenal glands to secrete adrenaline and nor-adrenaline. Both these hormones increase blood pressure and heart rates. ID
          <br/>
          Smoking is associated with increased incidence of lung cancers. It increases carbon monoxide level of the blood, which competes with oxygen for transport. As the concentration of haem-bound oxygen decreases, there is oxygen deficiency in the body. It also increases the craving for hard drugs.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 99.
          <br/>
          Why is there a fear amongst the guardians that their adolescent wards may get trapped in drug/alcohol abuse? (All India 2017)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          There is always a fear amongst guardians that their adolescents may get trapped in drug/alcohol abuse due to following reasons:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Adolescence is accompanied by several biological and behavioural changes. It is a vulnerable phase of mental and psychological development of an individual in which an individual may get addicted to alcohol/drugs very easily.
          </li>
<li>
           In this age, the first use of drugs or alcohol may be out of curiosity or experimentation, which later on turns to addiction.
          </li>
<li>
           Adolescents usually take drugs due to social pressure, need of adventure, excitement to avoid stress, depression and frustration.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          Question 100.
          <br/>
          Explain ‘addiction’ and ‘dependence’ in respect of drug/alcohol abuse in youth. (All India 2017)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Addiction is a psychological attachment to certain effects such as euphoria and a temporary feeling of well-being associated with drugs and alcohol. These drive people to take them without need or even when it becomes self-destructive. In the absence of any guidance or counselling, the person gets addicted and becomes dependent on their use.
         </p>
<p>
          Dependence on drug/alcohol is the tendency of the body to manifest a characteristic and unpleasant withdrawal syndrome, if regular dose of drugs/alcohol is discontinued abruptly. Withdrawal symptoms are characterised by anxiety, shakiness, nausea and sweating. Sometimes, it can be so severe that they may be life threatening.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 101.
          <br/>
          Prior a sports event blood and urine samples of sports persons are collected for drug tests.
          <br/>
          (i) Why is there a need to conduct such tests?
          <br/>
          (ii) Name the drugs the authorities usually look for.
          <br/>
          (iii) Write the generic names of two plants from which these drugs are obtained. (Delhi 2016)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>

          Question 103.
          <br/>
          Do you support ‘dope test’ being conducted on sports persons participating in a prestigious athletic meet? Give three reasons in support of your answer. (All India 2014C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Yes, the ‘dope test’ should be conducted on sports persons participating in a prestigious athletic meet. This is done to find out if any participant had taken any kind of performance enhancing drugs.
          <br/>
          The use of drugs in sports should be banned as
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           they increase muscle strength.
          </li>
<li>
           promote aggressiveness.
          </li>
<li>
           increase athletic performance.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          Because of above reasons, use of such drugs, e.g. steroids, analgesics, diuretics should be banned for participants as it would be unfair on the part of other participants (not consuming such drugs).
         </p>

         </p>
<p>
          Question 108.
          <br/>
          It is commonly observed that parents feel embarrassed to discuss freely with their adolescent children about sexuality and reproduction. The result of this parental inhibition is that the children go astray sometimes.
          <br/>
          (i) Explain the reasons that you feel are behind such embarrassment amongst some parents to freely discuss such issues with their growing children.
          <br/>
          (ii) By taking one example of a local plant and animal, how would you help these parents to overcome such inhibitions about reproduction and sexuality? (All India 2017)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) The reasons behind the embarrassment amongst some parents to freely discuss sexuality and reproduction related issues are as follows
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Communication gap is a big reason for the same. The parents feel that talking about such issues will have a negative impact on children.
          </li>
<li>
           In India, sex-related issues are considered as taboos, so people feel awkward while talking about them.
          </li>
<li>
           Social beliefs are also responsible for this. Most parents think that there has to be a V line of respect between parents and their children. Parents usually think that their child is too young to discuss over this topic.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          (ii) To overcome this inhibition, parents can make children understand about sexuality via scientific perspective.
          <br/>
          For example, in order to tell them about sexuality parents can take the example of cucurbit and papaya. In cucurbits, both male and female reproductive structures are present on the same plant, i.e, they are bisexual, while in papaya both male and female reproductive structures are present on different plants, i.e. they are unisexual. Similarly, in animals, earthworm is bisexual or hermaphrodite while cockroaches are unisexual. The concept of reproduction can be taught in same way by citing the examples of asexual reproduction in lower animals and sexual reproduction in higher animals.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 109.
          <br/>
          Modern life style in big cities and towns is surely making the life more easy and comfortable for people. On the contrary, many more health issues and problems are on the rise and one of them is allergic reactions.
          <br/>
          (i) Write any four steps you would suggest to minimise the cause of the above allergic responses.
          <br/>
          (ii) List any two allergens. How does the human body respond to them? Explain. (Delhi 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) Allergy is a hypersensitive reaction of the immune system to certain antigens present in the environment. The following steps can be used to minimise the allergic reactions
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Provide a less protected environment in early childhood.
          </li>
<li>
           Avoiding exposure to allergens like mites in dust, pollens, animal dander, etc.
          </li>
<li>
           Use of drugs; like antihistamine, adrenaline and steroids.
          </li>
<li>
           Exposing the patient to small doses of allergens and studying possible reactions.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          (ii) Mist in dust and pollens are allergens. The human body responds to them by producing IgE antibodies and releasing chemicals like histamine and serotonin from mast cells.
         </p>
<p>
