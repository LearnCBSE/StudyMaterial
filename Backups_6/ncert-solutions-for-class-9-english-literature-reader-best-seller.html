<p>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) One day last summer, the author was travelling to Pittsburgh by chair car on business. Most of the passengers were ladies. They were in brown-silk dresses cut with square yokes, laces and dotted veils. There were men who looked as if “they might be in almost any business.” However, his attention was drawn by the black, bald- spotted head just visible above the back of seat No. 9.
         </p>
<p>
          (b) John A. Pescud was the passenger of chair No. 9. Suddenly he hurled a book on to the floor between his chair and the window. The book was named “The Rose Lady and Trevelyan”. It was one of the best-selling novels
          <br/>
          of the present day.
         </p>
<p>
          (c) John A. Pescud didn’t hold a very high opinion about best sellers. The fiction writers are not consistent with their scenes and characters. They are far removed from reality. Their account is highly unreal, exaggerated and romantic. Sometimes the American hero falls in love with a royal princess from Europe. He follows her to her father’s kingdom. But in real life people choose life- partners belonging to their own status.
         </p>
<p>
          (d) The author asked John how he was getting along with the company. John replied that he was getting on pretty well. He had his salary raised twice since they met last time. He got a commission too. He had bought a “neat slice of real estate”. The firm was going to sell him some shares of stock. He was “in on the line of General Prosperity”. He also broke the news that he got married eighteen months ago.
         </p>
<p>
          (e) John met Jessie’s fatter at his ancestral house. At eleven sharp, he rang the bell. An old man about eighty showed up and asked what he wanted. John showed him his business card. He told the old man how he followed his daughter from Cincinnati, his business, salary and prospects. Then the old man related anecdotes and humorous occurrences. The Colonel expressed that he had never been so fortunate as he felt after meeting him.
         </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
          (f) John got ready to get off at Coketown. The author was surprised as the place didn’t hold much prospect for selling plate-glass. However, John told that while coming back from Philadelphia, his wife Jessie saw some petunias in a pot in one of the windows there. She used to raise such flowers in her old Virginia home. So he thought of getting off there to dig up some of the cuttings or blossoms for her.
         </p>
<p>
          (g) John is a hypocrite. What he says, he does the opposite. He expresses his uncharitable views regarding the best-sellers as they are far removed from reality. They are too romantic. But in real life people marry somebody in their own status. But John is another Trevelyan. He is just a commercial traveller but runs after Jessie whose father is a lineal descendant of belted earls. He is searching petunias for his ‘princess’.
         </p>
<p>
          (h)
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Physical appearance. A small man with a wide smile and an eye fixed on the end of the nose. A bald-spotted head.
          </li>
<li>
           His philosophy on behaviour. When a man is in his home town, he ought to be decent and law-abiding.
          </li>
<li>
           His profession. Travelling salesman for a plate-glass company.
          </li>
<li>
           His first impression of his wife, ‘…the finest looking girl. Nothing spectacular but just the sort you want for keeps’.
          </li>
<li>
           His success. Salary raised twice in a couple of years. Got a commission. Bought real estate. The firm going to sell some shares of stock. On the line of‘General Prosperity’.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          Question 5.
          <br/>
          Complete the flow chart in the correct sequence as it happens in the story.
          <br/>
          Hint: It begins from the time the author first saw Jessie till the time they marry.

          Question 6.
          <br/>
          Irony refers to the use of words to convey a meaning that is the opposite of their literal meaning. Working in pairs bring out the irony in the following:
          <br/>
          (a) The title of the story, “The Best Seller”.
          <br/>
          (b) Pescud’s claim, “When people in real life marry, they generally hunt up somebody in their own station. A fellow usually picks out a girl who went to the same high school and belonged to the same singing-society that he did.”
          <br/>
          (c) The name Trevelyan.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a)
          <strong>
           Ram:
          </strong>
          The title of the story, “The Best Seller” is ironical.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Sita:
          </strong>
          That it is. Irony refers to the use of words to convey a meaning that is opposite to their literal meaning.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Ram:
          </strong>
          John A. Pescud doesn’t like ‘best-sellers’ like “The Rose Lady and Trevelyan.”
          <br/>
<strong>
           Sita:
          </strong>
          He thinks that they present a highly unreal, exaggerated and romantic version of life.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Ram:
          </strong>
          But he himself is the “Best Seller”.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Sita:
          </strong>
          After all, he is a travelling salesman. He knows all the tricks and arts of selling.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Ram:
          </strong>
          And he sells such an incredible story.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Sita:
          </strong>
          He criticises Trevelyan but imitates his real life.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Ram:
          </strong>
          He is another Trevelyan hunting for petunias for his princess Jessie Allyn.
         </p>
<p>
          (b)
          <strong>
           Ram:
          </strong>
          Don’t you feel John A. Pescud is a hypocrite.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Sita:
          </strong>
          Without any doubt, he is.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Ram:
          </strong>
          Pescud claims “When people in real life marry, they generally hunt up somebody in their own station.”
          <br/>
<strong>
           Sita:
          </strong>
          He thinks that “A fellow usually picks out a girl who went to the same high school and belonged to the same singing society that he did.”
          <br/>
<strong>
           Ram:
          </strong>
          What John A. Pescud claims, he does just the opposite.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Sita:
          </strong>
          This is what irony is. He criticises best¬sellers.’ They present a highly unreal, exaggerated and romantic version of life.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Ram:
          </strong>
          But John doesn’t marry a sales girl. He falls in love with the “finest looking girl, a descendant of belted earls. She was the owner of a grand mansion as big as the Capitol at Washington
         </p>
<p>
          (c)
          <strong>
           Ram:
          </strong>
          In the end, the narrator wishes good luck to John, calling him Trevelyan.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Sita:
          </strong>
          The address is ironical.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Ram:
          </strong>
          Trevelyan falls in love with a royal Princess from Europe. He follows her to her father’s kingdom or principality.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Sita:
          </strong>
          And John A. Pescud does exactly the same.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Ram:
          </strong>
          John criticises the hero of “The Rose and Trevelyan” but imitates him.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Sita:
          </strong>
          He doesn’t run after a sales girl but after the finest girl, a descendant of belted earls.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Ram:
          </strong>
          And this modem Trevelyan hunts petunias for her princess Jessie Allyn in Coketown.
         </p>
<p>
          A newspaper reporter hears of the marriage of Pescud and Jessie. He interviews them and writes an article for the paper entitled: A Modem Romance.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Working in groups of four, write the article.
          </strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<strong>
           A Modern Romance
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          It happens. It may defy logic or reason but it happens. This is what they call a “modem romance”. It happens not only in the best sellers like “The Rose Lady and Trevelyan” but even elsewhere. Our hero is John A. Pescud. He is a travelling salesman of a plate-glass company. He is doing rather fine in his professional life. He had had a raise in salary twice in two years and bought some real estate. Our hero strongly believes in traditional middle class values. He hates running after princesses and thinks that a person should choose a girl of his background and status. He hates Trevelyan, the American hero from Chicago falling in love with a royal European princess and following her to her father’s kingdom.
         </p>
<p>
          So far so good. But our hero, John A. Pescud is clean-bowled when he sees “the finest looking girl” in the train while going to Cincinnati. He falls in love at the first sight. He follows her right up to Elmcroft, a place deep in Virginia. He finds that she is the daughter of Colonel Allyn who is a lineal descendant of betted earls. The Allyns live in a huge mansion as big as the Capitol at Washington. The girl pretends to be a princess who doesn’t want to talk to a commoner. She even threatens him not to meet her father who can feed him to his fox hounds if he does so. Pescud meets the Colonel. He hides nothing and tells him that he wants to win the love ofhis daughter. The Colonel makes him comfortable and relates anecdotes and humorous occurrences. John and Jessie meet again. And lo! They are married after a year. Do you know what is our hero doing now? Our Trevelyan is hunting for petunias in Coketown for his princess. Good luck, Trevelyan! I mean, John A. Pescud.

            ABOUT THE STORY
           </strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>
          ‘Best Seller’ underlines the idea that most of us say something and practise something else, knowingly or unknowingly. John A. Pescud, the protagonist, is a successful salesman. He chases a girl, meets her father and is able to marry her. She belongs to a very rich family of belted earls and lives in a huge, palatial building, where he himself belongs to an ordinary, middle-class family. When he meets the narrator, he has the temerity to criticise the authors of best sellers who unrealistically mix scenes and characters, showing people belonging to two diametrically opposed backgrounds in love and getting married. It shows that he is a hypocrite. Perhaps he is unware of it.

</strong>
<br/>
          John met the girl Jessie in a south-bound chair car going to Cincinnati. He was at once charmed by her looks. She changed cars at Cincinnati, and took a sleeper to Louisville. From there she proceeded through Shelbyville, Frankford and Lexington. She got off at a small village station in Virginia. Naturally, John found it difficult to keep up with her.

          How do you know Jessie knew that she was being followed by John ?

            Answer:

</strong>
<br/>
          Jessie told John on their first meeting that John would not have kept up with her if he had not woken up when the train started in Shelbyville. Then she said that he was about to miss the train at Powhatan Junction, too. In fact, she knew he was chasing her on every train.

            Question 20:
           </span>
</strong>
<br/>
          Is there anything ironic in John’s code of living – “to be always decent and right in you home town.”
          <br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
<span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer:
           </span>
</strong>
<br/>
          John’s code of living to be decent and right is admirable. One should be morally decent in behaviour with others. But it is ironic that John adds the words “in your home town.” Why only in one’s home town ? The irony lies in the use of these words. It means that one should be decent and righteous only in his home town, and not elsewhere.

<strong>
           Answer the following questions in 80-100 words each.
          </strong>

<p>
<strong>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
            Question 1:
           </span>
</strong>
<br/>
          A newspaper reporter hears of the marriage of Pescud and Jessie. He expresses a desire (liking their story) to write an article for all the people that your dedication and honesty can make impossible even possible. Never take things for granted but always give your best shot to be successful in life.

<span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer:
           </span>
</strong>
<br/>
          Who says that honesty and dedications are useless ? Many a times people have proved that if you are sincere, dedicated and honest, you can achieve anything in life. Even the impossible can be turned into possible. The only thing is that you should never take things for granted. You should be ready to give your best shot and you will be successful sooner or later in life.
         </p>
<p>
          The story of John Pescud and Jessie Allyn proves that anything can be achieved provided one is determined. John Pescud saw Jessie, fell in love with her and decided to marry her. He followed her for thousands of miles. He was shocked to know that Jessie belonged to an aristocratic family. He himself was an ordinary middle-class fellow. He approached Jessie and then her father. He did not lose heart. He was able to convey his sincerity of purpose. Jessie’s father agreed to let Jessie marry him. Thus, he turned the impossible into possible. All of us should learn something from this romantic story. It reveals how dreams sometimes become a reality.

            Question 2:
           </span>
</strong>
<br/>
          Pescud describes Jessie as ‘Nothing spectacular, you know, but just the sort you want for keeps’. Why did Pescud want Jessie ‘for keeps’ in the lesson ‘Best Seller’ ?

            Answer:
           </span>
</strong>
<br/>
          There are certain things and persons you want to keep for ever. When Pescud met Jessie in a train, he was at once impressed by her beauty, simplicity and elegance. He was so mesmerized that he began to follow her to know where she lived. He wanted to marry her, even though she was a complete stranger to him. He met her father and convinced him of his sincerity. He told the girl’s father that he followed her only because he wanted to marry her. His honesty and sincerity moved him and he allowed the marriage to take place. Thus, Pescud was able to keep the girl he desired for ever as his wife.

<span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer:
           </span>
</strong>
<br/>
          Girls are instinctively intelligent in matters of love. Jessie knew that someone was following her. At first she tried to evade him. When she realized that the man was determined, she began to like her. She thought he would talk to her. But when he did not, she liked him all the more. When Pescud met her and told her why he had followed her so far, she was amused.
          <br/>
          She told him : ‘Men are very clumsy… I know you were on every train. I thought you were going to speak to me, and I’m glad you didn’t.’
          <br/>
          The remark of Jessie clearly reveals that she knew all along that she was being chased by someone.

            Question 5:

</strong>
<br/>
          Discuss the irony in the title of the lesson, ‘Best Seller’.

<span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer:
           </span>
</strong>
<br/>
          The title of the story ‘Best Seller’ is ironical. The irony lies in John A. Pescud’s attitude towards best sellers and his own life story. He denounces all best sellers for being unrealistic. They mix scenes and characters from different backgrounds. Romantic heroes in best sellers defy logic. An ordinary American falling in love with a European princess and chasing her to her father’s kingdom-such is the staple story of a best seller.
          <br/>
          Ironically, we come to know that Pescud who denounces best sellers is nothing but another romantic hero of a best seller. Himself a middle-class person, he chases Jessie, an aristocratic lady belonging to a royal family.

          <br/>
          I am still puzzled about the young man I met today. What a romantic hero! He came chasing Jessie thousands of miles, and that too, without knowing anything about her and her family. This is called blind love. Should I agree , to their marriage ? Pescud – that is the name of the man – is just a salesman. But he is very honest and sincere. He genuinely loves my daughter. What I find him to my liking is that he is a patient listener. He is intelligent and witty. I hope Jessie also likes him. Why should then I oppose them ? I will ask Jessie what she thinks of Pescud. If she gives the nod, I am ready for their marriage.

            Question 7:
           </span>
</strong>
<br/>
          “The Best Seller” reveals the hypocrisy of Pescud. Why do people say something and practise something else ? How can we avoid being hypocrites ?

<span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer:
           </span>
</strong>
<br/>
          Pescud in “The Best Seller” asserts that he dislikes romances where people behave differently from what people do in real life. Towards the end we are amused to find that he himself does what is often done in the world of romances.
          <br/>
          Most of the people, in fact, say something and practise something else. It is so because they fear to face reality. They fear that if they state clearly what they intend to do, they may be ridiculed or censored. Sometimes, hypocrisy is practised to win somebody else’s favour. At times it is practised in complete ignorance.
          <br/>
          We can avoid being hypocrites by becoming alert in saying something publicly. We should say only that thing which we are sure of doing. We should get rid ourselves of all false fears and the question of false prestige. By becoming simple, truthful and clear-hearted we can avoid being hypocrites. Hypocrisy does not pay in the long run, while truthfulness always does.

</strong>
<br/>
          “ to be always decent and right in you home town”.
          <br/>
          Describe the character sketch of John A. Pescud with reference to the extract given above.
          <br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
<span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer:
           </span>
</strong>
<br/>
          John A. Pescud is a successful salesman. He is employed in a plate-glass company. His salary has been raised and he is allowed a commission, with a promise of getting some shares of stock. He has built a house in the East End. He is doing well in life.
          <br/>
          Though he denies his romantic temperament, he falls in love at first sight. He follows the girl of his choice for hundreds of miles. He succeeds in convincing her of his sincerity. .
          <br/>
          He has double standards in life. He criticises the best sellers for being unrealistic and inconsistent as they mix scenes and characters belonging to different backgrounds. In real life, however, he acts like the hero of a romance. Though he is an American travelling salesman, he marries a girl belonging to a family of belted earls. So what he says is contrary to what he practises. His code of living – “to be always decent and right in your home town” – also shows his duplicity. Why should one be decent and right only in his home town, and not elsewhere ?
          <br/>
          In short, he is a typical American businessman-rich, romantic and hypocrite.

</strong>

          Describe the journey of Pescud to Virginia in chase of Jessie.
          <br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
<span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer:
           </span>
</strong>
<br/>
          Pescud saw the girl (Jessie) in a train going to Cincinnati. He fell in love with her at once. He decided to follow her. He could not dare to talk to her, as she minded her business and paid no attention to him. She changed cars at Cincinnati and took another train to Louisville. There she bought another ticket. She continued her journey through Shelbyville, Frankford and Lexington.
         </p>
<p>
          It was becoming harder and harder for Pescud to keep pace with the girl. Had he not woken up when the train started in Shelbyville, he would have lost her. He was about to miss the train at Powhatan Junction, too. The last station the girl got off at was Virginia. She was received by an old man in worn-out clothes. Pescud continued his chase. The girl and the old man went in a gate on top of the hill. On the hill was situated a huge mansion. Later, he learnt that the girl was Jessie and the old man was her father, Colonel Allyn, who lived in the huge mansion. They belonged to a royal family of belted earls.
