          Letter Writing Class 12 Format, Topics, Samples
         </h2>
<p>
          The most common form of written communication is the letter. Letters should have a format that goes with the latest conventions.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Types of Letters include:
          </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
           Informal letters—These are letters written to close associates.
          </li>
<li>
           Formal letters — These are:
           <ul>
<li>
             Business or official letters (for making enquiries, registering complaints, asking for and giving information, placing orders and sending replies).
            </li>
<li>
             Letters to the Editor (giving suggestions on an issue).
            </li>
<li>
             Application for job.
            </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
          Important points to remember while drafting letters:

          </li>
<li>
           State your reason for writing in the first paragraph and stay on track.
          </li>
<li>
           Always include specifics that will help ease the recipient’s task. For instance, if you are writing to a bank, mention your account number.
          </li>
<li>
           If you refer to other correspondence, quote date of the letter(s), reference numbers, file numbers, order numbers, cheque number with date. Include copies, whenever possible.
          </li>
<li>
           Gently and respectfully direct the recipient’s course of action.
          </li>
<li>
           It may be strongly worded, but always be courteous and use polite language and pleasant tone.
          </li>
<li>
           Self-introduction should be avoided.
          </li>
<li>
           Informal expressions, greetings or contracted forms of words should not be used.
          </li>
<li>
           The language should be simple, straight forward and to the point.
          </li>
<li>
           Leave a line/additional space between paragraphs since no indentation is followed.
          </li>
<li>
           Open punctuation to be followed (no punctuation marks to be used).
          </li>
<li>

          Sir
          <br/>
          I had purchased a mobile phone Nokia E-63 from your showroom vide Bill No. 4020 on 22nd December. I was using it to my satisfaction since I bought it but for the past few days I have noticed that I now need to charge my phone after every 4-5 hours, unlike earlier when I used to charge my phone after almost 24 hours. Despite the fact that I am using the phone for the same duration as before the battery life has reduced drastically. It is my request to you to rectify this defect with the battery, or replace the handset that comes with a one-year warranty. The Phone Point enjoys a good reputation and goodwill, so I expect you to look into the matter at the earliest so as to enable me to use my mobile phone as conveniently as I. was using it before.

          We had purchased office furniture from your showroom on 17thanuary vide Invoice No. FWC/2051.1 am sorry to say that most of these items sent by you are of poor quality and very non-durable. Not even two months have passed and the chairs are already creaking as the springs used in them are of inferior quality. The wood on the tables too has started chipping off at different places. Four of the seven wooden almirahs are defective as their handles are loose and they are not even stable. It is most disgusting that a reputed shop like yours has been unable to maintain the quality of its products. I would request you to have this faulty lot replaced by a new one, with the best quality at the earliest and would appreciate if you initiated action in this matter fast.

          On behalf of the residents of Berpally Apartments, I wish to draw the attention of the concerned authorities about the poor bus service in our area which is adversely affecting the lives of the residents who are commuting by bus.
         </p>
<p>
          Our locality lies on the outskirts of the main city, so a majority of our residents resort to use of public transport to commute to and from the | city. But the poor bus-service which has also I led to the buses being over-crowded is becoming a major problem for residents. Despite our repeated pleas the concerned authorities have turned a deaf ear to our problem which we now have been facing for the past almost two years. Our only request is that a few additional buses be assigned for our i locality so that commuting to the city is not a nightmare for us.
         </p>
<p>
          T hope you will publish my letter in your esteemed daily so that our plea is heard and action is taken to lessen our woes.

          One now feels rather scared of these reckless drivers who it seems are all geared to drive over people and collide with other vehicles. Serious thinking and stern measures need to be taken up by the traffic police to prevent this problem. Heavy fines should be levied on overspeeding drivers and those who do not follow the traffic rules. After three consecutive fines the licence of reckless drivers should be confiscated for a minimum period of six months. The traffic police needs to deal very strictly with these careless citizens who indulge in such dangerous driving.

          Through the column of your newspaper, I would like to appeal to the concerned authorities to give this problem their immediate attention.

          Sir
          <br/>
          Through the medium of your esteemed newspaper, I wish to draw the attention of the concerned authorities towards the mosquito menace due to stagnant water in our locality.
         </p>
<p>
          It is most unfortunate that despite the level of awareness created by the media and the municipal department itself not much has been done to improve the potholes in the roads of our locality. They have not been repaired and this leads to water stagnation at various places during the monsoon season which, in turn, provides an ideal breeding place for mosquitoes. Despite our repeated complaints to the municipal authorities nothing has been ! done to improve the pathetic condition of the roads. These mosquitoes lead to the spread of a: variety of deadly diseases like dengue, malaria | etc. The authorities need to look into this matter! urgently by making arrangements to pump out; the stagnant water or by spraying repellents or kerosene oil to check the breeding of this disease-causing mosquitoes.
         </p>
<p>
          Since the only permanent solution to this problem is repairing the road, I would be grateful if the concerned authorities pay heed to our problem and necessary action on this is taken at the earliest.

          Sir
          <br/>
          Through the medium of your esteemed newspaper, I wish to enlighten the public about the negative influence of advertisements that promote useless commodities and superstitious beliefs through glamorous and exaggerated presentations.
         </p>
<p>
          The advertisers present a superficial scenario that is far removed from reality and has a lasting effect on the minds of the people. These advertisements, which can be seen, heard and read almost everywhere on televisions, radio, newspapers etc., are more pervasive and less recognizable as a sales pitch. In order to capture the minds of the prospective buyers, advertisement companies are constantly seeking new ways to target their audience and resort to all kinds of means to present their products attractively. We can rightly say that advertisers these days have lost their moral scruples and have no qualms in resorting to even lies and deceit to sell their product.
         </p>
<p>
          I hope you will publish my letter in your newspaper so as to make the general public aware about the negative and harmful effects of advertising and thus enable them not to take their exaggerated and glamorous presentations seriously.

          <br/>
          Dog owners walking their dogs in the streets and parks has been a common sight. These pet dogs relieve themselves along the streets, pavements and in the parks and thus make them dirty and unhygienic. Urgent measures need to be taken up to prohibit this practise so that we can keep our city clean. Heavy fines needs to be levied on these dog owners who take their pet dogs for relieving on the streets and parks. Certain open areas should be specified where these pet dogs can relieve themselves. People in countries like USA, UK etc. also keep pet dogs but ensure that they relieve themselves without contaminating their cities. So dog lovers in our country should also be made to adhere to certain rules to keep our city clean and hygienic.
         </p>
<p>
          I hope you will look into this matter urgently and seriously to ensure the cleanliness of our city.

          Through the medium of your esteemed newspaper, I wish to bring to notice the problem that many people are facing due to inadequate parking facilities in Commercial Street at M.G. Road.
         </p>
<p>
          This is causing a lot of inconvenience to the people who are forced to remain stuck in long traffic jams due to heavy congestion of vehicles, especially during peak traffic hours. Many times accidents occur due to overcrowding of vehicles and cause further chaos. It is my earnest request to the concerned authorities to take-up immediate steps to remedy this problem. This road leading to Commercial Street should be made a one-way road during the peak traffic hours, i.e., between 8 am to 11 am and 5 pm to 8 pm respectively. Heavy fines should be levied on people who wait inside their vehicles in the ‘No Waiting’ area. If these steps are strictly implemented it is sure to bring some respite to the daily commuters.
         </p>

          I hope you will publish my letter in your newspaper so that the concerned authorities take up immediate action to solve this problem.

         </p>
<p>
          This valuable heritage needs urgent attention failing which it is bound to be ruined in the very near future. It is my sincere appeal to the authorities to help in the restoration and preservation of this valuable heritage. All the ancient monuments in our country are an integral part of our rich cultural heritage and so we need to take care of them. They serve as important reminders of past events and cultures and are a tangible representation of the civilization in which they were constructed.
         </p>
<p>
          I am sure you too are equally concerned about the preservation of this moment and will definitely take up steps to ensure its restoration at the earliest.

          I am a member of the Parent-Teacher Association of our school and on behalf of the Association it is my earnest request to you to introduce vocational stream in our school to provide the facility of teaching subjects like computers, insurance etc. I am sure that the introduction of these subjects will prove extremely beneficial to many students who may not needlessly continue other academic subjects if their interest lies in vocational courses. The scope for these vocational courses has now increased like never before and so the introduction of this stream at the school level itself will prove to be very helpful for the students in planning their futures. Keeping the interest of the students in mind, we await a positive response from your end at the earliest.

          Through the medium of this letter I would like to bring to your notice the major problem of mosquito menace in our locality which has become a major cause of concern for all residents.
         </p>
<p>
          These days, particularly due to the rains, many sewages and lanes in our locality are full of stagnant water. This stagnant water is proving to be an ideal place for breeding of mosquitoes. The Municipal Corporation seems to have forgotten that sewages need to be cleaned and water-logging needs to be inspected on a regular basis during the monsoon season. The mosquito-menace has thus become a major health hazard for the residents of our colony. The incessant and uncontrolled breeding of mosquitoes is a very serious cause of concern and your department needs to take up immediate steps to clean our area and de-silt the sewages.
         </p>
<p>
          We hope you will look into our problem on an urgent basis and take immediate action to ensure that your department takes up effective steps to remedy the mosquito menace that we are facing.

          Through the medium of this letter, it is my earnest request to you to introduce a regular programme on ‘Career Counselling’ for the students of our country.
         </p>
<p>
          Many students are deprived of any opportunity to get a medium for guidance about their future career or even for the selection of subjects at the school or college level. This makes them totally confused and quite unsure about the future prospects of the subjects that they opt for. By introducing a programme on Career Counselling on your widely viewed channel, you will be helping many worthy students to take the right decisions to shape their future. Professional career counselling addresses a person’s interests, skills and educational background in a strategic way. Experienced and trained counsellors can be invited on this programme to facilitate the process of selecting. a particular career option.
         </p>
<p>
          Doordarshan as a channel has a mass appeal and thus 1 hope you will consider my request seriously and introduce this programme which will prove to be extremely beneficial to numerous students all over the country.

          Through the medium of this letter I would like to voice my strong thoughts against the ill-treatment meted out to stray dogs at the hands of callous and indifferent people.
         </p>
<p>
          It is indeed pathetic to see how these stray dogs are not even accorded the basic dignity and protection that we believe must be accorded to all life on our planet. The stray dogs are more than often denied the protection of the very laws enacted by the lawmakers, the provision for animal rights, animal welfare and the prevention of cruelty against animals. These dogs who have lived in our midst for more than 14,000 years have to be treated humanely. But unfortunately, most of these dogs live in a miserable state, suffering from ill-treatment and atrocities meted out to them by callous people. It is high time that the concerned authorities for animal welfare ensure proper implementation of laws relating to Animal Rights that can be the most effective weapon against the exploitation of these helpless animals.
         </p>
<p>
          I hope you will publish my letter in your esteemed newspaper so as to make people aware about the need to ‘be human’ with stray dogs who are also living beings.

          <br/>
          Through the medium of this letter I wish to bring to the notice of the concerned authorities the bad state of roads in the city due too which the commuters are facing a lot of problems. Due to poor maintenance, the condition of roads in the city is rather bad as they are full of potholes and cracks which lead to traffic jams and even damage the suspension of the commuters’ vehicles. It seems like the authorities are actually waiting for something untoward to happen before they wakeup and remedy this situation. Sources from Bengaluru Municipal corporation say the maintenance work of the city roads has been divided among agencies like Public Works Department and Bengaluru Development Authority which is the main problem as each agency gets a chance to pass on their responsibility.
         </p>
<p>
          It is now high time that a policy is made wherein all the busy and important roads should be developed by increasing their thickness every two years. By following this policy, the authorities can help to relieve the commuters’ problems.
         </p>

          I hope you will publish my letter in your esteemed newspaper so that the concerned authorities can look into this matter urgently.

          <br/>
          Through the medium of this letter I wish to bring to the notice of the Electricity Department the problems that we are facing due to the inadequate electricity supply in our town. Though we have been facing power cuts for a long time the situation has never been as bad as it has been in the recent past. Despite repeated complaints to the consumer service centre, there has been no respite to people who are facing a lot of problems every day. Power cuts disrupt the studies of children and also cause great inconvenience to the elderly who stay home all day. The soaring temperature makes it difficult to bear the heat as fans, coolers, air- conditioners are rendered useless with no electricity.
         </p>
<p>
          It is my suggestion to the Electricity Board to allot power cut timings to different areas based on a schedule so that people of that area are prepared to face a power cut during that time period. Moreover, notices can also be issued to commercial complexes to close down at least one hour before their closing time so that power can be saved.
         </p>
<p>
          It is my request to you to publish this grievance so that the authorities realize our difficulty, take note of the suggestions and do the needful.

          <br/>
          Our locality, Krishna Nagar on M.G. Road, is, as you must be aware a decade old colony and yet there is no drinking water supply and sewage connection in our locality. This is causing a lot of problem to all the residents who have been living in the most insanitary conditions for the past ten years. We are also spending thousands of rupees every month to buy drinking water from the market. Despite repeated pleas your department has turned a deaf ear to our woes.
         </p>

          This is yet another attempt to bring our problem to your notice and we sincerely hope that your department will take immediate action to solve our problem.

         </p>
<p>
          I am a regular commuter from Noida to Delhi and have been witnessing rash driving by the bus drivers without an exception. These reckless drivers carelessly endanger the lives of so many people on a daily basis. They flout all traffic rules, ump red lights, do not adhere to speed limits etc. They need to be issued very stern warnings with immediate effect. The Delhi Transport Corporation needs to take stringent action against these drivers. Despite repeated pleas and warnings by various passengers, these drivers have turned a deaf ear to the passengers’ pleas and continue with their rash driving. The General Manager of the Delhi Transport Corporation needs to take immediate action and if required cancel the driving licences of non-compliant drivers.

         </p>
<p>
          These three manholes are hazardous for pedestrians Since they are on the main road leading to our locality, they cause frequent mishaps at night, especially during the ongoing rainy season. During the rainy season, waterlogging takes place on the road and then it becomes difficult to see an open manhole and the chances of life-threatening accidents are very high. Our request to the Municipal Commissioner is to ensure that the concerned authorities put a proper cover on the manholes to ensure safety of the residents.
         </p>
<p>
          I sincerely hope that you will publish this letter in your esteemed newspaper so that the attention of the Municipal Commissioner is drawn to our problem and he can ensure speedy action.

<p>
          I have already written to the concerned authorities but no action has been taken so far. So, through your newspaper, I now wish to draw the attention of the Municipal Commissioner of Chennai to this problem. These stray animals cause traffic jams as well as accidents. The problem, specially of stray cattle on the road, has become a menace as they bring to a standstill the flow of traffic on the busy roads. They can be seen taking a nap anywhere, even in the middle of the road. Keeping in view the inconvenience being caused to commuters, I hope the Municipal Commissioner will not turn a deaf ear to this problem.
         </p>

          I also hope that you will publish my letter in your newspaper, so that this problem is dealt with urgently.

          Through the medium of the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I wish to draw the attention of the General Manager (Maintenance), State Transport, at the poor maintenance of the State Transport buses.
         </p>
<p>
          Last week I travelled in a State Transport bus from Chennai to Thiruvallavur and I was in for a shock as the air-conditioning of this so-called air-conditioned bus was not working.
         </p>
<p>
          Moreover, the quality of the maintenance of the bus was also rather poor. I had to spend my entire journey of about eight hours in unbearable heat. It is most unfair on the part of the Transport Department to charge high fares for air-conditioned buses and then to make passengers take journey which is an ordeal. Regular inspection of the buses must take place and a strict warning should be issued to the bus drivers and owners by the transport department. Immediate action should be initiated to ensure good maintenance of these buses.
         </p>
<p>
          I hope you will publish my letter in your esteemed newspaper so that the concerned personnel take remedial action to ensure the convenience of the bus passengers.

         </p>
<p>
          It is rather unfortunate that games and sports are not given as much importance in our country as academics by schools, colleges, parents and society in general. As a result of this, our sports achievements in the international arena are also not very spectacular. Our sportspersons always put up a poor performance in the major international sports events. In our country, we lay a lot of importance on academics and children are so stressed out because of this that they cannot pursue their passion for sports beyond a certain stage. Sports and games are extremely important for the physical, mental and emotional well being of an individual. Sports inculcate the values of team spirit, leadership, cooperation and perseverance.
         </p>
<p>
          We need to review our education system and create awareness about the importance of sports and games. The government should allocate resources for the development of quality sports infrastructure and also provide incentives and special quotas to sportspersons to encourage people to take up sports as a profession.

          Through the medium of the column of your esteemed newspaper, I wish to emphasize the need of having educational counsellors in each school for students who pass the secondary school examination.
         </p>
<p>
          After passing the secondary school examination, a candidate has to make a very difficult choice from a number of streams available to him at the senior school level. There is no valid mechanism to assess the candidate’s suitability for a particular stream. So the candidate gets extremely confused and feels rather unsure of the stream that he should choose. Often students make wrong choices due to parental, societal and peer pressure.
          <br/>
          If it is made mandatory for all schools to appoint educational counsellors it will prove very beneficial for the students and their parents. It will be easy for them to choose the stream they want to pursue at the senior school level.

Now, since the delivery of the books has been delayed to a point where it is bound to hamper students who require these books, we are forced to cancel our order with immediate effect. It is rather unfortunate but we are left with no choice in this matter. Kindly refund the amount we had remitted to you as advance payment for the books.

          It is hereby brought to your knowledge that in the last lot of sports items sent by your company to our school, received on the 3rd ofuly, some of the items were defective. The Packaging Department of your company has done a rather irresponsible on due to which five of the bats are broken, seven badminton and six lawn tennis rackets have been found as damaged. Since the cause of damage is negligent packaging at your end, you will need to replace the defective items at the earliest. It is my request to you to send the replacement for the above-mentioned sports items without delay. We have been dealing with your company for the past five years and would like to continue our association for a long time. So we await prompt replacement of the defective sports items from your end.

<p>
          Sir
          <br/>
          Through the medium of your esteemed newspaper I would like to express my concern over the problem of child illiteracy in rural India.
         </p>
<p>
          Recently on my visit to my native village I saw that some of the children in the age group of 514 years were either working in the fields or simply loitering in the streets. These children are missing out on valuable formal education. It is most unfortunate that despite various incentives by the government to provide education to children they are still not encouraged to go to school. The general attitude of parents, elders and children in the villages is one of indifference and disinterest. There is no motivation for rural child to go to school.
         </p>
<p>
          The government, NGOs and all citizens, in general, need to put in combined efforts to ensure that more children are formally educated in rural areas. There is no single solution to this problem. It needs to be addressed in multiple steps and at various levels.
         </p>
<p>
          Emphasis should be laid on skill development and children should be provided free meals, books and uniforms as an incentive to go to school. It is easy to sit in the comforts of our homes and crib about the lack of literacy among children and how our government is inefficient. Maybe if we all actually start making efforts, things can really change for the better.
         </p>
<p>
          I hope you will publish my letter in your newspaper so that the citizens of India can take more concrete efforts to ensure that children of rural India are educated.

<p>
          Through the medium of this letter I would like to reflect on the cricket board’s compliance that the players can take their wives, even friends along with them when they go abroad for a tournament. Does this fact distract the players or help them focus on their game in a better way?
         </p>
<p>
          The cricket board does not think this affects the performance of the player. It may be argued that wives and friends act as distractions and players may lose focus. However, having a spouse along is a source of emotional support. Presence of family helps in over-coming homesickness and keeps the players stress-free in pressure matches.
         </p>
<p>
          It all depends on the player. Once he is playing for the country, he has to give his 100 per cent. If the cricket board thinks this is good why are our athletes not allowed to enjoy the same privilege? All our players are mature enough; and till now we have seen good performance by the players who have been accompanied by their spouses. A few incidences cannot overview the past brilliant games won with the spouse attending the game in the spectator’s row. Expenditure on the travel and stay of their spouse is again a winning strategy to boost-up the spirit of the players. It is now high time we allow this privilege to our athletes as well.
         </p>
<p>
          I hope you will publish my letter in your newspaper so that it draws the attention of the Athletics Federation of India and they too consider to allow the athletes this privilege.

          <br/>
          Through the medium of your esteemed newspaper I would like to express my concern on how the tourists are abusing the available facilities and thus endangering the environment of the Corbett National Park.
         </p>
<p>
          Our group of about 40 students had gone on a 3-day tour through Corbett National Park. On our visit we saw the tourists, callous attitude towards the available facilities in the park. It was most unfortunate to see that tourists do not adhere to the rules of carrying a litter bag and leave their non-biodegradable garbage like plastic bottles, metal foils etc. inside the park. Moreover, actions such as trampling vegetation, parking in areas that are not designed for parking add to the destruction of the land. All these things are likely to endanger the environment.
         </p>
<p>
          I strongly feel that the authorities should take stringent action against the defaulters who display such a casual attitude towards the environment. Heavy fines and even penalties should be imposed on them so that these act as major deterrents for all tourists to use and not misuse the available facilities. Educating tourists on this sensitive issue and limiting the number of tourists and vehicles in these national parks may help in preventing further degradation of such parks.
         </p>
<p>
          I hope you will publish my letter in your newspaper so that tourists as will as the concerned authorities change their attitude and work along to conserve the National Parks of our country.

<p>
          Sir
          <br/>
          Through the medium of your esteemed newspaper I would like to raise my voice against exploitation of teachers who are paid a mere fraction of their authorised salaries. Recently I read in a newspaper that privately owned and managed schools in small towns or even in the suburbs of metropolitan cities exploit their teachers by paying them meagerly. This to . a very large extent affects their efficiency and performance in the classroom and thus also affects the lives of the students. Underpaid teachers are usually demotivated and lose interest in their jobs. Low salaries result incompetent teachers leaving their jobs in search of better pays.
         </p>
<p>
          Pay structure is potentially a very important incentive tool in the hands of the education policymakers and this needs to be implemented fairly in all schools. The policymakers need to view this problem with grave concern and find ways to solve it. Schools which do not pay the teachers according to the scales should have their accreditation cancelled by the CBSE and their recognition cancelled by the government. By implementing these suggestions with precision and strictness, exploitation of teachers can surely be dealt with in a very positive way and the injustice against them can be tackled.
         </p>
<p>
          I hope you will publish my letter in your newspaper so that the concerned authorities can take up steps to remedy this exploitation against teachers.

          Sir
          <br/>
          Through the medium of the column of your esteemed newspaper I would like to express my concern over the miserable condition of slums which have come up in every big city and give suggestions to improve the living conditions in these slums.
         </p>
<p>
          Lack ofob opportunities in the rural areas has forced people to migrate to cities. Every big city has a number of slums wherein the living conditions are most pathetic and unhygienic. Slums lack basic sanitation services, supply of clean water, reliable electricity, schools, dispensaries and other basic services. The Municipal Corporations seem to have turned a blind eye towards the improvement of slums.
         </p>
<p>
          Urgent steps need to be initiated to better the living conditions in the slums. The government needs to strengthen the capacity of NGOs to engage with local authorities and other service providers for the sustainable provision of basic services in slums whereby slum dwellers are provided access to clean water, improved sanitation and waste management services. Moreover income-generation activities should be supported and community-managed schemes should be developed to enable slum dwellers to secure funds for the improvement of physical facilities.
         </p>
<p>
          I sincerely hope you will publish my letter in your newspaper so that the concerned authorities awaken to improving the lives of the lakhs of people living in the slums.

         </p>
<p>
          Besides air and water pollution, our cities are also under an attack of noise pollution. Marriage processions, DJs during weddings, loud music are all sources of noise especially troublesome for senior citizens, ailing people and students. Another major source of loud and unwanted sounds nowadays is unplanned urban development and construction. The increasing levels of noise pollution have created the urgent need of general awareness about its sources, effects and preventive measures. Noise pollution has adverse effects on human health and behaviour.

          Increased levels of noise may cause damage to psychological health, hypertension and stress, hearing loss, disturbed sleep, etc. Some stringent measures need to be adopted by the concerned authorities to solve the problem of noise pollution. Public awareness needs to be created and people should be made to realize its harmful consequences. Proper regulations need to be enforced on the use of loudspeakers beyond a certain volume and time. The concerned authorities need to take up adequate measures to ensure that noise-related restrictions are not violated.
         </p>
<p>
          I hope you will publish my letter in your newspaper so that the concerned authorities take stringent measures to curb the problem of noise pollution without further delay.

          Sir
          <br/>
          Through the medium of the columns of your esteemed newspaper I would like to describe the importance of medical tourism for India.
         </p>
<p>
          It gives us pleasure when we read in the newspapers how patients from abroad come to hospitals in India and get themselves treated at a fraction of expenses they would have incurred elsewhere. All Indian hospitals have skilled physicians and nursing practitioners. The medical facilities provided in Indian hospitals are at par with the international standards but still cost less, not because of any compromises in quality but due to the favourable currency conversion rates and lower operating costs in India.
         </p>
<p>
          The Indian Government is taking steps to address infrastructure issues that might hinder the country’s growth in medical tourism. Hospitals have hired language translators for the comfort of patients from countries like Russia and Africa. The boom in medical tourism is helping the Indian economy in earning foreign exchange and has also improved relations with other countries. Acknowledging the significance of medical tourism in India, the Government is trying to increase the international tourist traffic by offering medical visas.
         </p>
<p>
          It is not a wonder that India is being promoted as a healthcare destination in ‘Incredible India campaign’ being run by the tourism industry. I hope you will publish my letter in your newspaper.

          <br/>
          Through the medium of this letter I would like to bring to your notice the chaotic conditions prevailing in the casualty and emergency department of your hospital.
         </p>
<p>
          Yesterday, I had taken a victim of a hit and run accident who required immediate medical attention to the casualty and trauma ward of your hospital. To my horror, the conditions in the casualty department were extremely chaotic and disorganised. None of the on-call nurses and doctors seemed to know what to do. The injured person I had accompanied was writhing away in pain as his broken arm was left unattended for an agonising one hour. He was finally attended to but only after precious time had been lost. This delay in receiving the required medical help could have proved fatal for the victim.
         </p>
<p>
          This matter is of grave concern and requires the urgent attention of the hospital authorities as the casualty department cannot afford to show such incompetence with medical and other emergency cases coming in at any time.
         </p>
<p>
          I hope you will look into this matter immediately and ensure a smooth functioning of the casualty department.
         </p>

          Sir
          <br/>
          As you are aware Park Lane, Chanakyapuram has four public schools in close proximity to each other. Through the medium of this letter I would like to bring your attention to the traffic situation that the children, staff and parents of these schools have been facing for the past two years.
         </p>
<p>
          In the morning and afternoon there is heavy traffic along the roads and hundreds of students are put through a lot of inconveniences. Commuting to and from school is extremely troublesome for the students and their parents who come to drop and pick them up. Despite our repeated complaints the authorities have turned a blind eye to our woes.
         </p>
<p>
          It is my earnest request and hope that you will take up immediate measures to regulate the flow of traffic in this area. Please ensure the presence of a traffic policeman in the morning and afternoon. The traffic light on this road also does not function properly making the situation worse. Heavy fines should be imposed on people who park their vehicles wrongly. A little initiative from your end can help to remedy this problem and save us from unnecessary inconvenience.
         </p>
<p>
          Awaiting a favourable response from your end at the earliest.

<p>
          Sir
          <br/>
          Through the medium of this letter I would like to draw your attention and express my concern on the problem of road rage which has come to assume alarming proportions in big cities and has become a serious problem. Road rage is a grave issue on which there is need to concentrate and take necessary action. The increasing number of incidents of road rage should serve as a warning to the city’s administrators. People do not realize that aggressive driving is a traffic violation whereas road rage is a criminal offence.
         </p>
<p>
          A person who is not able to control his emotions and bullies another on the road does not deserve any leniency so merely imposing a fine is not enough. There must be fear of the consequences. Aggressive physical and verbal behaviour on the roads sometimes even ends up in murder in extreme cases. So, harsher implementation of law and stricter punishments are necessary to instil fear in people. Effective intervention by law enforcement agencies and more policing can help to bring the number of road rage cases down.
         </p>
<p>
          On the social front the public can be educated and encouraged to become polite drivers, follow traffic rules and regulations, avoid confrontations and keep the driving environment calm to avoid incidents of road rage.
         </p>
<p>
          I hope you will take a serious note of this grave problem and implement stringent and immediate measures to ensure its control.
         </p>

<p>
          There is problem of seepage in the walls and ceilings. The wall paint has started peeling off, there is leakage in the sanitary fittings and the lift gets stalled to name a few. Keeping in mind the reputation that your company enjoys in the market I had never imagined that a flat built by your reputed company would have such poor construction. The least you could do now is to rectify the faults at the earliest to avoid us further inconvenience.

          Through the medium of the columns of your esteemed newspaper I wish to protest against the growing number of advertisements during television serials.
         </p>
<p>
          There are many good programmes that one wants to watch on T.V. but the interruption caused due to too many advertisements leads to loss of interest of the viewer, irritation and anger that finally leads to poor TRPs.
         </p>
<p>
          It is a known fact that advertising revenue is the life-blood of the media but there must be consideration for the viewers who are mainly responsible for low and high TRPs of a programme. A highly commercial attitude of the channel will certainly not go in its favour as far as viewership is concerned. It is my suggestion that only a limited number of advertisements should be telecast during serials and other programmes.
         </p>
<p>
          I hope you will publish my letter in your newspaper so as to enable the television channel management to take a serious note of this matter.
         </p>

          Yours sincerely

<p>
          Sir
          <br/>
          Through the medium of the columns of your esteemed newspaper I would like to complain about the lack of street lights in our locality at Station Road.
         </p>
<p>
          I would like to apprise that our locality is inhabited by thousands of residents living in more than 1,000 flats on either side of the road. The electricity board has installed poles on the road to supply light but these poles have never been lit. During these days of winter, when it turns dark early, there is always an apprehension of an accident taking place because there is heavy traffic on the road round the clock.
         </p>
<p>
          Moreover, it is extremely risky for children, ladies and old people to venture out in the dark. It is a convenient invitation to miscreants. It is our request to the concerned authorities to ensure that the street lights are fixed and lit up without further delay so that the residents can carry out their daily activities without fear even during the evening.
         </p>
<p>
          I am sure if my letter is published in your esteemed newspaper, the authorities concerned will awaken from their slumber and our problem will be solved.
         </p>

          Yours sincerely

          <br/>
          My ward, Aakash Arora, is a student of your school studying in class V-B. I would like to bring to your notice and express my concern over cases of ragging occurring in the school, as one day Aakash came back with tom uniform as a result of ragging by some seniors.
         </p>
<p>
          I am very anxious and worried ever since and have recently heard about more such incidents from other parents. There is fear among the children and it is my request to you to take strict action against this problem. The harassed children need to be given moral support and the miscreants need to be dealt with strictly. The school should also arrange for their counselling and may I also suggest that the school authorities take the help of parents in tackling this problem at its root level.
         </p>
<p>
          Such cases need to be stopped to maintain the healthy environment of the school and I am sure you will deal with this problem with immediate effect.

<p>
          Sir
          <br/>
          Through the medium of the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I wish to draw the attention of our society towards not giving women the respect and status that is long overdue to them.
         </p>
<p>
          It is rather unfortunate that women are stared at, stalked and even molested. Crimes against women such as rape, molestation, eve-teasing have been steadily on the rise reflecting the need for greater gender sensitization. Women have been constantly fighting to assert their rights and against their gender disparity. Sadly, they have not been able to overcome this issue as they are fighting against males, some of whom do not want to change their dirty and perverted mindset. Offences against women are acts of regression to establish that they are considered secondary citizens. Empowerment of women is an irritant to the mindset of a patriarchal society.
         </p>
<p>
          So, we as a society, need to fight against this decadent patriarchal culture that is shaming our society. Laws are redundant if we as a society do not take the social responsibility towards safety and security of women.
         </p>
<p>
          I sincerely hope you will publish my letter in your newspaper so that our society awakens to give women the respect and status they deserve.

          I had purchased a TV set from your showroom vide Bill no. 2743 on 22nd December, 20xx. Not even a month has passed that it has started giving us trouble and is not working properly. While purchasing this LED TV which has the code 406 75 MT 42, I was assured it was the latest and the best model. But I have discovered that this is not true. The picture quality is blurred and the buttons on the remote control are also not working properly. I hereby request you to either ensure that these defects are rectified to our satisfaction or otherwise please replace this faulty TV set.

          <br/>
          Our village Gopalpur is along National Highway No. 12 in district Ramnagar. The state roadways buses pass our village but do not stop here.
         </p>
<p>
          On behalf of the residents of our village it is my request to you that our village be provided with a bus stop. Many people from our village are daily commuters who work in district Ramnagar. It would be very convenient for them to have a bus stop in our village. As for now the nearest bus stop for state roadways buses is about five kilometres away from our village and it is rather difficult to get any public transport to reach our village. Moreover, safety of our villagers, is a major concern. As there are no streetlights, people have to walk back 5 kms in the dark to get back to the village.
         </p>
<p>
          Keeping these problems in mind, I sincerely hope that you will ensure our village gets a bus stop. Since our village is along the highway there will be no diversion of route for the state roadways buses. Awaiting an early response from your end.

          Subject: Commendable book fair by National Book Trust
         </p>
<p>
          Sir
          <br/>
          Through the medium of the columns of your esteemed newspaper I would like to express my feelings and bring to the notice of the public certain facts regarding the recently concluded book fair at Anna Grounds.
         </p>
<p>
          National Book Trust had organised a week-long book fair from the 11th to 17th November at Anna Grounds. I visited the fair and even bought a few books. It was indeed a pleasure to see the well-organised book fair and it was evident that the organizers had taken all the required efforts to ensure the meticulous arrangements. It was also heartening to see the enthusiasm of the visitors whose large presence at the book fair was proof enough that despite the dominance of the world of the internet, books have not yet lost their relevance and value. It is commendable how parents were encouraging their children to visit various stalls and explore the different varieties of books on display. Books are still and will always remain the most compact and inexpensive way of gaining knowledge.
         </p>
<p>
          I hope you will publish my letter in your newspaper so that the importance of organising and visiting book fairs is reiterated.
         </p>

          Yours sincerely

          Sir
          <br/>
          On behalf of the residents of our colony, Manu Vihar, I would like to request you to provide at least two traffic police constables to regulate the traffic in our colony.
         </p>
<p>
          Our middle-class colony is full of housing society flats and there is a senior secondary school running right in the middle of our colony. In the morning as well as in the afternoon the road passing in front of the school is congested with school buses, minibuses, private cars etc. This causes majors leading to unnecessary delays and causes a lot of inconvenience to the residents.
         </p>
<p>
          So we would like to request you to provide at least two traffic police constables to regulate the traffic, especially in the morning and afternoon.
          <br/>
          I hope to get a positive response from your end at the earliest so that this traffic menace and inconvenience being caused to the residents of Manu Vihar is lessened.

          You are Ram/Rajani, a resident of Nagpur. You feel students should use the Internet mostly for gaining knowledge rather than wasting away time merely on entertainment.

          Subject: School’s role in ensuring fruitful internet usage among students
         </p>
<p>
          Sir
          <br/>
          Through the medium of the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I wish to express my concern about students wasting their precious time on the internet merely for entertainment and also point out how school authorities can control students’ netsurfing at school.
         </p>
<p>
          With the increasing internet usage in schools across the country it is imperative for schools to consider the responsibility of giving students guidance in becoming productive net-users. As internet services enter the classrooms and students are being exposed to the full range of what is available on the net, it should be in the domain of the school authorities to enable students to manage their capabilities in utilising the net for knowledge, learning skills, gaining information on any and every subject.
         </p>
<p>
          students should be counselled to function productively alongside distraction. They should be conditioned to think of this social media not only as escape medium to drown out other essential tasks but as something that can be integrated for gaining information and knowledge. There should be supervision for net-surfing in schools so that students do not waste away time using the internet merely for entertainment.
         </p>
<p>
          I hope you will publish my letter in your newspaper so that the school authorities take up measures to ensure fruitful usage of internet among students.

          Question 88.
          <br/>
          You areay/Jaya, living at 1, MG Road, Trichy. You are very much concerned about the irregular supply of drinking water supplied through taps, which indirectly makes even low-income people spend a substantial amount every month on buying drinking water. Write a letter to the municipal authorities about the problem and the financial burden arising out of this issue, seeking immediate corrective measures. (Comptt. All India 2017)

          Subject: Irregular Supply of Drinking Water
         </p>
<p>
          Sir
          <br/>
          Through the medium of this letter I would like to draw the attention of the municipal authority to the problem of irregular drinking water supply which the residents of M.G. Road are facing. Since there is irregular supply of drinking water supplied through taps we are forced to spend a substantial amount of money every month on buying drinking water from the market. This undue but necessary expenditure is hard-hitting for people of the low-income group. They undergo a major financial burden arising out of this expenditure and the municipal authority has turned a blind eye and a deaf ear to their woes. I, once again, would like to request you to ensure immediate corrective measures wherein the residents get a regular supply of drinking water.
         </p>
<p>
          I hope you will take a serious view of this matter and implement corrective measures with immediate effect.
         </p>
<p>
          Yours sincerely
          <br/>
