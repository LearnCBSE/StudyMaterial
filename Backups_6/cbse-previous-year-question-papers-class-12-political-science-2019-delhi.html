          Answer:
          <br/>
          International organisations help countries to cooperate to create better living conditions all over the world and provide a common platform to discuss contentious issues and find peaceful solutions by a fixed mechanism, rules and bureaucracy.
          <br/>
          OR
          <br/>
          Arms control regulated the acquisition or development of ,weapons. It is a term for international restrictions upon the development, production, stockpiling, proliferation and usage of weapons of mass destruction. Arms control helps to establish co¬operation, stability and mutual security between different countries in the world. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968 was an arms control treaty in the sense that it regulated the acquisition of nuclear weapons.

          Justify the reorganization of states in India on language basis by giving one suitable argument. [1]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Division into linguistic states changed the nature of democratic politics and leadership in some basic ways. The path to politics and power could be better distributed among speakers of regional language. Such leaders were accepted better by the indigenous people. Linguistic re-organisation also gave some uniform basis to the drawing of state boundaries. It strengthened national unity. State Government offices could function smoothly and easily than before.

          Explain the meaning of ‘Coalition Govern¬ment’. [1]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          A coalition government is a government formed when no single party secures absolute majority in the Lok Sabha. In such a situation, two or more parties come together and form a government. This reduces the dominance of any one party within that coalition.

          Answer:
          <br/>
          The two countries have to undertake confidence building measures to reduce the risk of / war. Leaders have to set an example by holding joint dialogues to understand each other better and to find solutions to the major problems between the two neighbours. Trade and cultural exchanges should be encouraged once confidence has been achieved through dialogue.

          Apart from the same, both armies have to offer olive branches and stop cease-fire violations. The heads of both the countries should realize that r only negotiations, not action can help increase the camaraderie between the two nations. Both countries should try to de-escalate the current level of tensions on LOC.
          <br/>
          OR
          <br/>
          The Sino-Indian conflict affected the communist Party of India in various ways. This and the growing rift between China and the Soviet Union created , irreconcilable differences within the Communist Party of India (CPI). The pro-USSR faction remained within the CPI and moved towards closer ties with the Congress. The other faction was for sometime closer to China and was against any ties with the Congress. The party split in 1964 and the leaders of the latter faction formed the Communist Party of India (Marxist) i.e., (CPI-M). In the wake of the China war, many leaders of CPI (M) were arrested for being pro-China. The members of the party were confused and unsure about which stance to follow. Some of them were ardent Nehru followers while some were impressed by younger leaders like Jyoti Basu and Harikrshanan Singh.

          Question 8.

          Evaluate the impact of national emergency declared in June 1975. [2]
          <br/>
          OR
          <br/>
          Assess the role played by ‘defections’ on Indian politics.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The emergency brought the agitation to an abrupt stop; strikes were banned; many opposition leaders were put in jail; the political situation became very quiet though tense. Deciding to use its special powers under Emergency provisions, the government suspended the freedom of the Press. Newspapers were asked to get prior approval for all material to be published. Apprehending social and communal disharmony, the government banned Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and Jamait-e-Islami. Protests and strikes and public agitations were also disallowed. Most importantly, under the provisions of Emergency, the various Fundamental Rights of citizens stood suspended, including the right of citizens to move the Court for restoring their Fundamental Rights.
          <br/>
          OR
          <br/>
          Defection refers to the act of showing disloyalty by changing parties for personal motives. After the 1967 general election, the breakaway Congress legislators played an important role in installing non-Congress governments in three States—Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. Allegations were made that the legislators changed their allegiance very frequently and in Haryana, it was reported that a legislator changed his allegiance thrice in a day. Between March and December 1967, out of total membership of about 3,450 state legislators about 320 changed their loyalties. This caused politial instability. People started questioning the credibility of these parties and their leaders. Thus, a visible lack of confidence in party affairs and their initiatives was seen among people.

          Question 9.
          <br/>
          Analyse the main reason for limiting the Dravidian Movement from the whole South India to Tamil Nadu only. [2]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The movement by Dravidians was at its height from the 1940s and 1960s but due to the fear of Tamil hegemony, it failed to find any support outside Tamil Nadu. In 1960, the DMK leader decided to delete the demand of Dravida Nadu from the party programme at a meeting held in the absence of Annadurai. Annadurai abandoned the claim for Dravida Nadu-now geograhically limited to modem Tamil Nadu, completely in 1963.

          Question 11.
          <br/>
          Explain any two constraints on the American hegemony. [2 × 2 = 4]
          <br/>
          OR
          <br/>
          Explain any two factors that have contributed to Pakistan’s failure in building a stable democracy.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          At the beginning of the 21st century, the United States was a superpower. But history tells us that empires decline because they decay from within. Similarly, the biggest constraint to American hegemony is from within. Two constraints on American power are as follows :
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           The first constraint is the institutional architecture of the American State itself. American system is based on division of power between the three organs of government, i.e., the Congress (Legislature), the Executive (President) and Judiciary.
          </li>
<li>
           The second constraint of American Power is the open nature of the American Society. It means that there is no government control over mass media.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          OR
          <br/>
          Pakistan has failed to establish a stable democracy due to several reasons, they are :
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           The social dominance of military, clergy and landed aristocracy in Pakistan has been central to military dictatorship and overthrow of democratic regimes. Pakistan’s hostility with India has also made the military strong.
          </li>
<li>
           The strength of pro-military group clearly shows that political parties and democracy in Pakistan is not in their true forms. This misled democracy and rule by selfish-minded parties will only hamper Pakistan’s security.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          These grounds have helped Pakistani military to stay in power for long. And though democracy has not been successful in Pakistan, pro-democracy sentiments are quite strong here. The lack of a real ‘support for democratic rule in Pakistan has further ensured the dominance of military in Pakistan. The US along with other western states, has favoured military dictatorship in Pakistan.

          Question 12.

          Describe any four criteria that have been proposed in recent years for new permanent and non-permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. [4 × 1=4]
          <br/>
          OR
          <br/>
          Describe any four new sources of threats to non- traditional security.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          On the reforms of structures and processes, the biggest discussion has been on the functioning of Security Council. The following are just some of the criteria that have been proposed for election of new permanent and non-permanent members of the security council. For a new member, it has been suggested that it should be :
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           A major economic power.
          </li>
<li>
           A major military power.
          </li>
<li>
           A substantial contributor to the UN budget.
          </li>
<li>
           A big nation in terms of its population.
          </li>
<li>
           A nation that respects democracy and Human Rights.
          </li>
<li>
           A country that would make the council more representative of the world’s diversity in terms of geography, economic systems and culture.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          Security council should reform and improve its working to make the UN more effective i.e., inclusion of member states should be judged on the basis of their contribution to peace keeping initiatives. Permanent members are industrialised developed countries and should have special Veto Powers. This position remains the same and no one is allowed to enter in this elite list. Such developed big countries usually neglect the need of smaller nations and such situation must be changed and balanced by enhancing representation from developing countries to become either permanent or non-permanent members of security council.
          <br/>
          OR
          <br/>
          Non-traditional concept of security includes human and global security covering a wide range of threats affecting human existence : ‘
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           It does not cover only the states but also the individuals and communities also.
          </li>
<li>
           It emphasises on security and nature of threat and right approach to deal with the threat.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          Its sources are identified as follow :
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Terrorism refers to political violence to target civilians deliberately and discriminately to use it as a weapon against national government.
          </li>
<li>
           Human right refers to basic conditions which an individual is supposed to enjoy as a human being, for example, political rights, freedom of speech and expression and right to live a dignified life. Its violation poses a serious threat to security as well.
          </li>
<li>
           Global poverty refers to low economic growth and national income and low standard of living in developing or least developed countries.
          </li>
<li>
           Health epidemic is a very serious threat to country’s security because severe acute respiratory syndrome HIV, AIDS, spread across countries through migration, business, tourism and military operations.

          Question 13.

          Explain any two major causes of globalization. [2 × 2 = 4]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Globalization means linking the economy of the country with the economies of other countries by means of trade and free mobility of capital labour etc. In the, process of Globalization, countries become interdependent and the distance between people gets shortened.
          <br/>
          Causes of globalization :
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           The four flows of ideas, capital, commodities and people is caused by technological advances. It has revolutionised communication between different parts of the world.
          </li>
<li>
           With technological advances, it is important for ‘People’ in different parts of the world to ‘recognise these interconnections’ with the rest of the world. For example, the Bird Flu or tsunami is not confined to any particular national boundary, even economic events impact other nations.
          </li>
<li>
           Interconnection with rest of the world due to availability of improved communication also helped to cause globalisation.

          Nuclear programme was initiated in late 1940’s and early 1950’s, under the guidance of Homi J. Bhabha. The main features of the Nuclear Policy of India are :
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           India wants to generate atomic energy for peaceful purpose.
          </li>
<li>

          </li>
<li>
           India did not join the NPT, it considered the NPT as discriminatory and refused to sign it.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          OR
          <br/>
          Causes of conflict between India and China :
          <br/>
          (i) CPEC: China Pakistan economic corridor is a road which starts from China and ends at Gwadar Port. This road passes through a disputed territory, Pakistan occupied Kashmir, which is a matter of conflict between both India and Pakistan since ages.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) South China Sea: China claims their historical rights over South China sea. However, over a sea, no single nation can have claim. India and China are in constant conflict over this issue. They disagree on China’s claim of ownership.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) NSG: India wants to be part of Nuclear Suppliers Group which has 48 countries. China has blocked India from joining this group. The reason given is that India is a non party to NPT—Non Proliferation treaty and thus can not be trusted with the membership.
         </p>
<p>
          (iv) China’s support to Pakistan in the UN and otherwise for their Nuclear programme is also a reason for their bitter relations.

         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           The 1971 elections were followed by the . crisis in East Pakistan and Indo-Pak war leading to the establishment of Bangladesh. These events increased the popularity of Indira Gandhi. Even the opposition leaders admired her statesmanship.

<li>
           Indira Gandhi’s party swept the state assembly elections held in 1972. She was seen as the protector of the poor and the under privileged as well as a strong nationalist leader.
          </li>
<li>
           In 1971, the constitution was amended to remove legal obstacles for abolition of privy purses. This added to the popularity of Indira Gandhi’s government among the masses.
          </li>
<li>
           She had given a famous positive slogan ‘Garibi Hatao’. She focused on growth of public sector. She had imposed ‘ceiling’ on rural land holdings and urban property to remove disparities in income and opportunity.

          <br/>
          It is important to remember that India chose to involve other members of the non-aligned group in this mission of reducing tension. During the Cold War, India repeatedly tried to activate those regional and international organizations, which were not a part of alliances led by the US and the USSR.

          (iii) Highlight any two features of India’s policy of Non-alignment. [1 + 2 + 2 = 5]
          <br/>
          OR
          <br/>
          Read the following passage and answer the following questions :
          <br/>
          India has maintained good relations with all the post-communist countries. But the strongest relations are still those between Russia and India. India’s relations with Russia are an important aspect of India’s foreign policy. Indo-Russian relations are embedded in a history of trust and common interests and are matched by popular perceptions. Indian heroes from, Raj Kapoor to Amitabh Bachchan are household names in Russia and many post-Soviet countries. One can hear Hindi film songs all over the region, and India is part of the popular memory.
          <br/>
          (i) What is meant by the post-communist countries ?
          <br/>
          (ii) Explain any two factors responsible for strong relations between India and Russia.
          <br/>
          (iii) How are India’s relations with Russia an important aspect of India’s foreign policy ?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) The cold war was an ideological conflict, a matter of power rivalries. It was a series of ideologies, sociological and political confrontations between the United States and Soviet Union, backed by their respective allies.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) India took care to stay away from both the power blocs. It raised a voice against the newly decolonised countries becoming a part of these alliances. India favoured active intervening in world affairs to soften cold war rivalries.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) Non-alignment allowed India to take international decisions and stances that served its interests rather than the interests of the superpowers and their allies.
          <br/>
          India was often able to balance one superpower against the other. If India felt ignored or unduly pressurised by one superpower, it could tilt towards the others, neither alliance or power could take India for granted.
          <br/>
          OR
          <br/>
          (i) Post-Communist countries were the former Soviet republics which gave up communism after undergoing shock therapy.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Russia and India share a vision of a multipolar world order. Indian military gets most of its hardware from Russia. Since India is an oil importing nation, Russia is important to India and has repeatedly come to the assistance of India during its oil crises. Russia is important for India’s nuclear energy plans and assisted India’s space industry by giving the Cryogenic rocket when India needed it. This is another reason for the strong ties of relationship between the two countries.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) Relationship with Russia is the key pillar of India’s foreign policy. Under the special and privileged partnership, the two countries share several institutionalized dialogue mechanisms and operate at both political and officials levels to ensure regular interactive and follow up cooperation activities. They help India maintain very peaceful relations with Russia without strongly aligning to its ideology.

          <br/>
          All proponents of human security agree that its primary goal is the protection of individuals. However, there are differences about precisely what threats individuals should be protected from. Proponents of the ‘narrow’ concept of human security focus on violent threats to individuals.
          <br/>

          (i) Human security reveals a people-centered and multi-discripilinary understanding of security It involves a number of research fields, including development studies, international relations, strategic studies arid human rights.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) The broad concept of human security includes threats from hunger, diseases and natural disasters which kill more people than war, genocide and terrorism combined.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) Terrorism: It refers to political violence that targets civilians deliberately, and indiscriminately. Health Epidemics: Like HIV, AIDS, bird flue and SARS have rapidly spread across country.
          <br/>
          Human Rights: Individuals need to be protected from human rights violation and exploitation. People try to exploit and deprive others of their basic human rights, which leads to a lot of problems.
          <br/>
          Global Poverty: Global poverty is another source of insecurity. This threatens human beings, their lives, their health and their living standards.

          Read the passage given below carefully and answer the questions that follow :
          <br/>
          India did not follow any of the two known paths to development. Elements from both these models were taken and mixed together in India. That is why Indian economy was described as ‘mixed economy’.
          <br/>
          (i) Name the two models /paths to development.
          <br/>

          Read the following passage and answer the questions given below:
          <br/>
          India is not the only country to have experienced the dominance of one party. If we look around the world, we find many other examples of one- party dominance.But there is a crucial difference between these and the Indian experience. In the rest of the cases the dominance of one party was ensured by compromising democracy. In some countries like China, Cuba and Syria the constitution permits only a single party to rule the country.
          <br/>
          (i) Which political party dominated the political scene of India after independence and how long ?
          <br/>
          (ii) How did the one-party dominance in India differ from that of China ?
          <br/>
          (iii) Highlight any two drawbacks of a single party rule.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) (1) Capitalist model
          <br/>
          (2) Socialist model.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) India did not accept the capitalist model of development in which development was left entirely to the private sector nor did it follow the socialist model in which private property was abolished and all the production was controlled by the state.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) Mixed economy is an economy where both private and public sector co-exist together. Its basic features are :
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Both the sectors work within invisible lands of market forces and visible lands of planning set by government.
          </li>
<li>
           ‘State owned’ means of production is present for social welfare and ‘private owned’ means of production is present to be regulated by states. All individuals have freedom to produce goods and products.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          OR
          <br/>
          (i) Congress dominated the political scene of India after independence for more than 50 years.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) India is not the only country to havejdominance of one party, we have some other-examples for the same. However, the dominance of one party in Indian democracy does not compromise with democratic spirit of constitution whereas in China, the constitution only permits the presence of a single party, thus compromising with the spirit of democracy.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) One party system stifles public sector innovation. The rule become corrupt and nepotistic. One party dominance allows for authoritarian rule. This kind of government is the unpopular kind for people are not allowed to express contradictory thoughts, they are left out of decision making process.

          (i) The China wall shown is related to China.
          <br/>
          (ii) Its economy, together with other factors such as population landmass, human capital, resources, regional location and political influence makes it a very strong and powerful country. Its strength is emphasised with the picturization of Dragon.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) A superpower is defined as a country that has global influence over others in cultural, technological, military and political spheres, and China is emerging as a strong contender for the position. China is the world’s top exporting and trading country, having exported $430.3 billion worth of goods into the US in 2017. The sheer size of its population (over one billion people), combinecUvith a growing middle class has given the Country unrivaled buying power.

          Question 22.
          <br/>
          Describe any four reforms purposed by United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) for the development of least developed countries. [6]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The Non-aligned countries were categorised as the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) — and the . challenge they faced was to be more developed. Economic development was also vital for the ‘ independence of the new countries. Without sustained development, a country could not be truly free and then be dependent on richer countries. The idea of a New International Economic Order (NIEO) originated with this realization.
          <br/>
          Reforms of the global trading system proposed by UNCTAD in 1972.
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           To give the LDC’s complete control over their natural resources exploited by the developed Western countries.
          </li>
<li>
           To obtain access to western markets so that the LDCs could sell their products and therefore, make trade more beneficial for the poorer countries.
          </li>
<li>
           To reduce the cost of technology from the western countries.
          </li>
<li>
           To provide the LDCs (Least developed countries) with a greater role in international economic institutions.
          </li>
</ul>

          Question 23.
          <br/>
          Explain the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka and any two consequences of it. [3 x 2 = 6]
          <br/>
          OR
          <br/>
          Explain any three major events that affected the relations between India and China.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The Sri Lankan Tamils launched parties and struggles for the recognition of Tamil as an official language, for regional autonomy and equality of opportunity in securing education and jobs. But their demand for more autonomy for provinces populated by the Tamils was repeatedly denied. By 1980s, several political organisation were formed demanding an independent Tamil Eelam state in eastern part of Sri Lanka.
         </p>
<p>
          The distrust between the two communities turned into widespread conflict. It soon turned into a civil war. As a result, thousands of people of both the communities were killed. Many families were forced to leave the country as refugees and many more lost their livehood.
          <br/>
          India sent IPKF forces which could not attain any success and earned the enmity of Tamil people.
          <br/>
          OR
          <br/>
          The major events which affected the Indo-China relations are as examined below :
          <br/>
          (i) Great Powers: Before the advent of western imperialism, both were great powers. However, there was limited interactions between the two and neither country was very familiar with the other.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Hindi Chini-Bhai-Bhai: After independence for a brief period, the two countries came closer and the slogan Hindi Chini bhai-bhai became popular.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) Tibet and Border Conflict: Chinese takeover of Tibet and border conflicts had a negative effect on their relationship. Along with this, India’s decision to provide asylum to Dalai Lama also strained their relationship. Diplomatic relations between the two countries downgraded until 1976.
         </p>
<p>
          (iv) Change in China’s political leadership: After a change iii political leadership, the policy become more pragmatic and less ideological. A series of dialogue to resolve the border issue were initiated in 1981.
         </p>
<p>
          (v) Rajiv Gandhi’s visit to China and its outcomes: December 1988 and Rajiv Gandhi’s visit improved the relations. Measures to maintain peace were taken.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 24.
          <br/>
          Analyse India’s stand on environment issues discussed at the international level. [6]
          <br/>
          OR
          <br/>
          Evaluate the cultural consequenes of globaliza-tion.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The main principles of India’s stand on environmental issues are mentioned below :
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           India signed and ratified the 1997 Kyoto . protocol in August 2002.
          </li>
<li>
           At the G-8 meeting in June 2005, India pointed out that the per capita emission rates of developing countries are a tiny fraction of those in the developed world.
          </li>
<li>
           India believes in the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and therefore is of the view that the major responsibility of curbing the emissions rests with the developed countries, which have accumulated emissions over a long period of time.
          </li>
<li>
           India’s international negotiation position relies heavily on principles of historical responsibility as enshrined in UNFCCC.
          </li>
<li>
           India has initiated different programme and policies such as National Auto-Fuel Policy, the Energy Conservation Act 2001, Electricity Act 2003 to help improve the environment.
          </li>
<li>
           India has suggested that SAARC countries should adopt a common position on major global environment issues because that will make a greater impact.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          OR
          <br/>
          Effects of globalization may be positive as well as negative :
          <br/>
          (i) External influences simply enlarge our choies and sometiems they modify our culture without overwhelming the tradition. For example, the burger is no substitute for a masala dosa and, therefore, does not pose any real challenge. In the same way blue jeans can go well with a homespun Khadi Kurta.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Globalisation broadened our cultural oudook and promotes cultural homogenisation. While cultural homogenisation. While cultural homogenisation is an aspect of globalisaztion, the above process also generates precisely the opposite effect. It leads to each culture becoming more different and distinctive. This process is called cultural heterogenisation.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) The culture of a developed society leaves its imprint on a less powerful society and the world begins to look more like a dominant power which it wishes to be.
         </p>
<p>
          (iv) This is dangerous not only for the poor countries but for the whole of humanity, for it leads to the shrinking of the rich cultural heritage of the entire globe.
         </p>

          Question 26.
          <br/>
          Describe any three important events that led to the split in the Congress Party in 1969. [3 x 2 = 6]
          <br/>
          OR
          <br/>
          Describe any three events that led to the imposition of emergency in 1975.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Three causes of the split in the congress party in 1969 :
          <br/>
          (i) Differences with the syndicate: After the 1967 elections, PM Indira Gandhi had to deal with the syndicate, a group of powerful and influential leaders from within the congress, who had played major role in her election as the leader of the party.
          <br/>
          These leader expected her to follow their advice. However, Indira Gandhi gradual attempted to strengthen her position and carefully sidelined the Syndicate. Their rivalry came in the open in 1969 over the presidential elections following President Zakir Hussain’s death and also differences over the reforms introduced by Indira Gandhi.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Presidential Elections 1969: Following President Zakir Hussain death, the post of the president of India fell vacant in 1969. Despite Mrs. Gandhi’s reservations, the ‘Syndicate’ nominated her long time opponent, N. Sanjeeva Jleddy as the official congress candidate. In Gandhi retaliated by encouraging Vice-president V. V Giri to file his nomination as an independent candidate. The defeat of N. Sanjeeva Reddy formalised the split in the party into congress (organisation) and that led by Indira Gandhi as congress (Requisitionists).
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) Reforms by Indira Gandhi: Revolutionary steps taken by Indira Gandhi were not welcomed by the Congress leaders. She had launched a series of initiatives like public distribution of food grains, land reforms, nationalisation of fourteen private banks a abolition of the ‘privy purse’ or the special privileges given to former princess. Her policies were opposed by Morarji Desai and older leaders, too, had serious reservations about this left programme.
          <br/>
          OR
          <br/>
          Circumstances that led to imposition of emergency :
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Clash between the executive (Government) and judiciary.
          </li>
<li>
           The government diverted all energies for the maintenance of law and order, as a result development was not taking place.
          </li>
<li>
           Students’ movements in Bihar and Gujarat against price rise and corruption.
          </li>
<li>
           Railway strike led by George Fernandes.
          </li>
<li>
           A big rally at Ram Lila Maidan and call to the employees including police/army not to obey the undemocratic orders.
          </li>
<li>
           Judgements of Allahabad High Court setting aside the election of Indira Gandhi.
           <br/>
           All these led to the atmosphere of distrust against Indira Gandhi who hurriedly tried to save her position by imposing emergency.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          Question 27.
          <br/>
          Assess any three benefits of the coalition governments in India since 1989. [3 x 2 = 6]
          <br/>
          OR
          <br/>
          Analyse any three main causes of unrest in Jammu and Kashmir.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The new era of coalition politics emphasises on pragmatic considerations rather than on ideological positions and political alliance without ideological agreement.
          <br/>
          (i) Coalition politics has shifted the focus of’ political parties from ideological diferences to power sharing arragements. Thus most parties of the NDA did not agree with the Hindutva ideology of the BJP, yet they came together to form a government and remained in power for a full term.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) It eliminates the fear of one-party dictatorship like that of congress and shows emergence of pragmatic politics.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) Different groups and religions can be represented in the government due to various regional and smaller political parties.
          <br/>
          OR
          <br/>
          When Maharaja of Kashmir signed the Instrument of Accession with Government of India, it was also agreed upon that once the situation got normalized, the views of the people of J &amp; K would be ascertained about their future. India agreed to maintain the autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir. Since then, the politics of J &amp; K always remained controversial and conflict ridden for both external and internal reasons. Externally, Pakistan has always claimed that Kashmir valley should be part of Pakistan. There is a dispute within Kashmir about the status of the state within the Indian Union. This makes the people of Kashmir feel isolated and alone.
         </p>
<p>
          Internally, there is a dispute about the status of Kashmir within the Indian union. Kashmir was given a special status by Article 370 and 371 in Indian Constitution. Article 370 gives greater autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir compared to other States of India. The State has its own Constitution. All provisions of the Indian Constitution are not applicable to the State. Laws passed by the Parliament apply to Jammu &amp; Kashmir only if the State agrees. This special status has provoked two opposite reactions. There is a section of people outside of J &amp; K that believes that the special status of the State conferred by Article 370 does not allow full integration of the State with India.
         </p>
<p>
          Terrorism is also one of the major causes of unrest in Kashmir valley. Innocent civilians and border force officers are killed and captured in cease-fire violations and major attacks almost every day. This causes a lot of unrest in the Kashmir Valley.

          Question 13.
          <br/>
          Explain any two arguments given by the advocates of economic globalization. [4]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Any three effects of globalisation on the economy of a country :
          <br/>
          (i) Globalisation has involved greater trade in commodities across the globe. The restrictions imposed by different countries on allowing imports from other countries have been reduced. Similarly, the restrictions on movement of capital across countries have also been reduced. This means that investors can invest their money in other countries, including developing countries where they might get better returns.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Globalisation has led to similar economic policies being adopted by governments in different {iarts of the world, that has generated different outcomes in different parts of the world. Economic globalisation has created an intense divide of opinion all over the world, since the same set of policies do not lead to the same results everywhere.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) Globalisation generates greater economic growth and well being for larger sections of the population, when there is de-regulation. Greater trade among countries allows each economy to do its best which would benefit the whole world. Globalisation has increased interdependence and integration between government businesses and ordinary people in different parts of the world.

<p>
          Question 16.
          <br/>
          What is meant by ‘Privy Purse’ ? Evaluate the role played by Indira Gandhi in the abolition of Privy purses. [1 + 3 = 4]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Privy purse was measured on the basis of extent of revenue and potential of the merging state and an assurance was given at the time of integration of princely states that the ruler’s family would be allowed to retain certain private property.
         </p>
<p>
          Privy purses were criticised and the privileges given to princely states at the time of accession, integration and consolidation were protested.
         </p>
<p>
          Hence, some leaders like Indira Gandhi insisted on abolishing the privy purses because hereditary privilegers were not constant with the principle of equality, social and economic justice in constitution.
          <br/>
          In the elections of 1967, Indira Gandhi made this a major election issue and got a lot of public support. With a massive victory in 1971 election, the constitution was amended to temove legal obstacles for abolition of privy purses.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The Soviet system gave preference to the state and the institution of the party. This system centered around the Communist party and no other politial party coud be formed and elected. The economy was also planned and controlled by the state.
          <br/>
          Few features of the Soviet system :
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           The Soviet system was very bureaucratic and authoritarian.
          </li>
<li>
           There was lack of democracy and absence of freedom of speech. No other political party was allowed, Soviet system centred around the Communist Party.
          </li>
<li>
           All the institutions were under direct control, the decisions were biased and arbitrary and the board which decided the course of action was unaccountable to anyone.
          </li>
<li>
           Russians dominated everything and people from other regions felt neglected and often suppressed.
          </li>
<li>
           The party refused to recognise the urge of people to manage their own affairs including social and cultural affairs.
          </li>

          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          OR
          <br/>
          The Soviet union installed nuclear missiles in Cuba and decided to convert it into a Russian base. This had put the US under direct target from a close range, leading to a situation where a clash seemed inevitable. This was known as Cuban Missile Crisis.
         </p>
<p>
          Cuba was an ally of the Soviet Union and received both diplomatic and financial aid from it, Nikita Khrushchev, the leader of the Soviet Union decided to convert Cuba into Russian base as geographically, Cuba was located within a short distance from USA and also because she was worried that the Americans might overtake Cuba, overthrow Fidel castro, and use it against them in 1962.
         </p>
<p>
          Three weeks after the Soviet Union had placed the nuclear weapons in Cuba, the Americans became aware of it.
          <br/>
          American president Kennedy ordered American warships to intercept any Soviet ships heading to cuba as a way of warning the USSR of his seriousness. Cuban missile crisis didn’t break out in a hot war but it is often considered as a high point in the cold war.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          A coup took place in 1991 which was encouraged by Communist Party hardliners. Boris Yelstin opposed the coup because he was against the centralised control.
          <br/>
          OR
          <br/>
          Non-alignment offered the newly decolonised countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America a third option—not to join either alliance. They started spreading the message of peaceful co-existence and mutual cooperation and also intervened in their activities, in order to soften the blow. It culminated the growing cold war tensions.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Mikhail Gorbachev was the last president of the Soviet Union and he served as president of the Soviet Union from 10th March, 1985 to December 1991.
          <br/>
          OR
          <br/>
          India’s policy was neither negative nor passive. It was not a policy of ‘fleeing away’. On the contrary, India was in favour of actively intervening in world affairs to soften Cold War rivalries. India tried to reduce the differences between the alliances and thereby prevent differences from escalating into a full-scale war. Indian diplomats and leaders to communicated and mediated between Cold War rivals such as in the Korea War.

          <br/>
          Explain any two arguments given by the advocates of political globalization. [4]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The primacy base of the state continues to be the unchallenged basis of political communin’. The state continues to discharge its essential functions (law and order, national security) and consciously withdraws from certain domains from which it wishes to. States continue to be important.
         </p>
<p>
          In some respects, state capacity has received a boost as a consequence of globalization, with enhanced technologies available at the disposal of the state to collect information about its citizens. With this information, the state is better able to rule.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) Economic weakness: The weakness of the economy was the major cause of dissatisfication among the people in USSR. People were dissatisfied with huge military spending and expenditure on satellite states.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Political un-accountability: There was widespread corruption, nepotism and lack of transparency, which led to loss of trust and faith in Soviet system.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) Gorbachev’s reforms: People started to enjoy freedom under Michael Gorbachev’s reforms, they began to demand more. The demand grew into a big force which turned difficult to control.
         </p>
<p>
          (iv) Rise of Nationalism : Rise of nationalism among countries like Russia, Baltic republic, Georgia etc., is the most important and immediate cause of disintegration of the USSR.
         </p>
<p>
          (v) Soviet Union had become stagnant in an administrative and political sense as well.
         </p>
<p>
          vi) With the public perception of the Soviet government declining each day ambitions aspirations for Independence were created in countries like Estonia, Ukraine.

          </li>
<li>
           Kwame Nkrumah : President, Ghana.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          In a broader context, the major factor contributing to the organisation of the conference was the impact of decolonization, and the founding of a great number of newly independent African states on the world stage in the 1960s.
         </p>
<p>
          Non-alignment movement was the division of the newly independent government aroufld the two opposed factions established in the Wake of the government.
          <br/>
          The first non-aligned summit was held in Belgrade in 1961. This was the culmination of at least three factors : (i) cooperation among these five countries, (ii) growing Cold War tensions and its widening arenas and (iii) the dramatic entry of many newly decolonised African countries into the international arena. By 1960, there were 16 new African members in the UN.

          How has European Union evolved over time from an economic union to an increasingly political one? Explain.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Nepal was a Hindu kingdom in the past and then a constitutional monarchy in the modern period for many years. Throughout this period, political parties and the common people of Nepal have wanted a more open and responsive system of government. But the king, with the help of the army, retained full control over the government and restricted the expansion of democracy in Nepal. The king accepted the demand for a new democratic constitution in 1990, however, after a strong movement demanding democracy. But democratic governments had a short and troubled career. During the nineties, the Maoists of Nepal who believed in armed insurrection against the monarch and the ruling elite fought tooth and nail against the armed , forces of the king. There was also a triangular conflict among the monarchist forces, the democrats and the Maoists.
         </p>
<p>
          In 2002, the king abolished the parliament and dismissed the government, thus ending even the limited democracy that existed in Nepal. In April 2006, there were massive, country wide, prodemocracy protests. The struggling pro-democracy forces achieved their first major victory when the king was forced to restore the House of Representatives that had been dissolved in April 2002. The largely non-violent movement was led by the Seven Party Alliance (SPA), the Maoists and social activists. Nepal formed a constituent assembly to draft the constitution. The Maoist groups agreed to suspend armed struggle. They wanted the constitution to include the radical programmes of social and economic restructuring. The Maoists and some other political groups were also deeply suspicious of the Indian government and its role in the future of Nepal. In 2008, Nepal became a democratic republic after abolishing the monarchy In 2015, it adopted a new constitution.

          The European union has evolved over time from an economic union to an increasingly political one. The EU has started to act more as a nation state, while the attempts to have a constitution for the EU have failed. It has its own flag, anthem, founding date and currency. It also has some form of a common foreign and security policy in its dealing with other nations. The European Union has tried to expand areas of cooperation while acquiring new members, especially from the erstwhile Soviet bloc. The process has not proved to be easy, for people in many countries are not very enthusiastic in giving the EU powers that were exercised by the government of their country. EU (European Union) initially started as economic power and has now become a major political power too. This is explained as below :
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           EU foundation was laid for a common foreign and security policy cooperation, with its own flag, anthem and currency. It also has a common foreign and security policy to deal with other nations.
          </li>
<li>
           The EU is the world’s biggest economy Its currency Euro can pose a threat to the dominance of the US Dollar. Its share in world trade is 3 times larger than that of US.
          </li>
<li>
           Now, the EU also has political and diplomatic influence. Two members of EU, Britain and France, hold permanent seats on the UN Security Council. This has enabled the EU to influence some US policies such as current US position on Iran’s nuclear programme.
          </li>
<li>
           Its use of diplomacy economic investments, and negotiations rather than coercion and military forces has been effective.
          </li>
