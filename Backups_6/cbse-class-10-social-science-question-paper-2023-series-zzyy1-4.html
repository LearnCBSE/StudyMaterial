          <br/>
          (A) Employers used various methods to recruit and retain labour. These are –
          <br/>
          (i) Recruitment was done by agents engaged by employers and paid a small commission.
          <br/>
          (ii) Agents also tempted the prospective migrants by providing false information about final destination, modes of travel and nature of work.

          Or
          <br/>
          (B) The Spanish conquerors achieved success in their mission of conquest of America, not due to their weapons or strong military power, but due to the germs they carried, such as those of small-pox. The original inhabitants of America had no immunity against these diseases that came from Europe. Once this disease was introduced, it spread into the continent very t fast and killed a large number of people bringing down the strength of the community. This made conquests easy and paved the way for colonisation.

          “Agriculture and industry move hand in hand.” Support the statement with examples. [2]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Agriculture and industry in India are inseparable and are interdependent on each other:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Agro-industries in India have boosted agriculture by raising its productivity.
          </li>
<li>
           Industries depend on agriculture for their raw materials, e.g. cotton textile industry.
          </li>
<li>
           Industries provide many agricultural inputs like irrigation pumps, fertilisers, insecticides, PVC pipes, machines and tools etc. to the farmers.
          </li>
<li>
           Manufacturing industries have assisted agriculturists to increase their production and also made the production processes very efficient.
          </li>
<li>
           Development of different modes of transport by industrial sector has not only helped farmers to obtain agricultural inputs but has also helped them trade their products. (any two)

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Different persons have different notions of development because life situations of persons are different. For example, Construction of dams leads to generation of hydroelectricity, thus development. However many people have to be displaced from their villages, hence it may not be development for them.

          “Women face discrimination in various ways in our society.” Explain any tioo ways. [2]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Women face disadvantages and are discriminated against in various ways in India:
          <br/>
          (i) Literacy rate among women is only 54% in comparison to 76% among men. In studies girls
          <br/>
          mostly perform better than boys, but they drop out simply because their parents prefer to spend their resources on their boys’ education. A smellier proportion of girls go for higher studies.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) On an average, a woman works more than an average man everyday. Since much of her work is not paid for, therefore often not valued.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) The Equal Wages Act provides for equal wages for equal work. But in almost all areas of work from sports to cinema, from factories to fields, women are comparatively paid less even if men and women both do exactly the same work.
         </p>
<p>
          (iv) The child sex ratio (number of girl children per thousand boys) is very low. In India the national average is 927. In some places it is as low as 850 or even 800, because parents prefer to have sons so they get the girl child aborted before her birth.
         </p>
<p>
          (v) In urban areas, women are unsafe. Even in their homes they suffer from beating, harassment and other forms of domestic violence. (any two)

          Question 25.
          <br/>
          “Ideas of national unity in the early nineteenth century Europe were closely allied to the ideology of liberalism.” Examine the statement. [3]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The term ‘liberalism’ comes from the Latin root liber which means to be free.
          <br/>
          (i) For the new middle classes of Europe, liberalism stood for freedom for the individual and equality of all before the law. It emphasized the end of aristocracy and clerical privileges and stood for a constitution and representative government through parliament. People also stressed inviolability of private property, drawing the basic foundation from the French Revolution.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) From the very beginning, universal suffrage, i.e., voting rights were granted only to the property-owning men, excluding men without property and all women. However, throughout the nineteenth century and early twenties, many movements were organized demanding equal political rights.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) In the economic sense, liberalism stood for the freedom of markets and the abolition of state-imposed restrictions on the movement of goods and capital. People often attempted to go beyond the state restrictions such as the formation of a customs union by Prussia in 1834 which abolished tariff barriers and number of currencies from 30 to 2. The creation of railway networks further stimulated national unification and the wave of economic nationalism in all contributed towards strengthening wider national sentiments.

          Answer:
          <br/>
          Steps taken by the government to bring about improvements in agriculture are termed as ‘Institutional Reforms’.
          <br/>
          Various institutional reforms have been taken by the Indian Government to bring about improvements in agriculture:
         </p>
<p>
          (i) Collectivisation and consolidation of land holdings to make them economically viable.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) The green revolution based on the use of package technology and the White Revolution to increase milk production are important strategies which were initiated to improve agriculture.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) Cooperation with farmers and Abolition of Zamindari system.
         </p>
<p>
          (iv) Provision of crop insurance to protect the farmers against losses caused by natural calamities, i.e. drought, flood, cyclone, fire and disease.
         </p>
<p>
          (v) Establishment of ‘Grameen Banks’, Cooperative Societies and Banks for providing loan facilities to the farmers at lower rates of interest.
         </p>
<p>
          (vi) Kissan Credit Card (KCC), Personal Accident Insurance Scheme (PAIS) are some other schemes introduced by the government for the benefit of farmers.
         </p>

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) Information Technology has brought the countries of the world closer. With its help various jobs have been created and are outsourced to other countries.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Information technology has played an important role in spreading out production of services across countries. Orders are placed through internet, designing is done on computers, even payment for designing and printing can be arranged through internet. Internet also allows us to send instant electronic mail (e-mail) and voice (voice-mail) across the world at negligible cost.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) Technology has made e-commerce, e-banking, e-learning, e-mail and e-govemance a reality.

          Question 28.
          <br/>
          Analyze the need of Political Parties in the Democracy. [3]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          We can understand the necessity of political parties by imagining a situation without parties. Every candidate in the election will be independent. Therefore, no major policy changes will be made. Elected representatives will be accountable to their constituency but no one will be responsible for the smooth running of the country.
          <br/>
          As societies become large and complex, they need an agency to gather views on various issues and to present them to the government. There is need to bring various representatives together so that a responsible government can be formed.
          <br/>
          A mechanism is needed to support or restrain the government to make policies, justify or oppose them. Political parties fulfil the needs of a representative government and are thus a necessary condition for a democracy.

          <br/>
          Or, (B) Why is there a need to protect workers in the Unorganized Sector? Explain. [3]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (A) Tertiary sector or Service sector plays a very significant role and its importance is increasing day by day:
          <br/>
          (i) Greater the development of primary sector and secondary sector more would be the demand for Services.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Tertiary sector has become the largest producer in India because various kinds of Services such as hospitals, educational institutions, post and telegraph services, police stations, courts, village administrative offices, transport, banks, insurance companies, etc. are required.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) Even development of agriculture and industry leads to the development of services such as transport, trade and storage, etc.
          <br/>
          Or,
          <br/>
          (B) (i) In the rural areas, this sector comprises of landless agricultural labourers, small and marginal farmers, share croppers and artisans (weavers, carpenters, goldsmiths). These farmers need to be supported through adequate facility for timely delivery of seeds, agricultural inputs, credit, storage facilities and marketing outlets.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) In urban areas, workers in the small scale industry, casual workers in construction, trade and transport, street vendors, head load workers, garment makers, ragpickers etc. are all a part of the unorganised sector. Small scale workers need government aid for procuring raw materials and marketing of their goods.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) Jobs are usually low paid and not regular. There is no security of jobs. Labour exploitation may exist. Employers are masters who can ask workers to leave whenever they so desire. Usually, it is done when there is less work. (Example, hired tlabourers in farms, tailors in a garment-making factory involved in export.)
         </p>
<p>
          (iv) Workers in Unorganised sector do not enjoy the benefits which are enjoyed by the workers in the Organized sector.

          Question 30.
          <br/>
          (A) Examine the progress of the Civil Disobedience Movement in the countryside. [5]
          <br/>
          Or, (B) Analyze the ways through which people of different communities developed a sense of collective belonging in India. [5]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (A) Rich peasant communities, like the Patidars of Gujarat and the Jats of Uttar Pradesh, became active in the Civil Disobedience Movement.
          <br/>
          (i) Being producers of commercial crops, they were hard hit by trade-depression and falling prices.
          <br/>
          (ii) As their cash income reduced, they found it impossible to pay the government’s revenue demand.
          <br/>
          (iii) These rich peasants became ardent supporters of the Civil Disobedience Movement.
          <br/>
          (iv) For them fight for Swaraj was a struggle against high revenues.
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          (B) History and fiction, folklore and songs, popular prints and symbols all played an important role in creating a sense of collective belonging leading to the growth of nationalism.
          <br/>
          (i) With the growth of nationalism, the identity of the Indian nation came to be visually associated with the image of Bharat Mata (as it had happened in Germany and France: Germania in Germany and Marianne in France).
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) During the Swadeshi Movement in Bengal, tricolour flag (red, green and yellow), with eight lotuses (depicting eight provinces of British India), was designed. Carrying the flag during marches became a symbol of defiance and a sense of collective belonging.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) The glorification of developments in ancient India in the fields of art and architecture, Science and Mathematics, religion and culture, law and philosophy, craft and trade had also helped in the growth of nationalism. These nationalist histories encouraged the readers to take pride in India’s great achievements in the past and struggle to change the miserable conditions (cultural and economic decline) of life under the British rule.
         </p>
<p>
          (iv) Idea of nationalism also developed through a movement to revive Indian folklore. Folk tales were sung by bards in the villages, to give a true picture of traditional culture, which had been damaged by outside forces.

          Question 31.
          <br/>
          (A) How is pipeline transport network important in the transport system of India? Explain with an example. [5]
          <br/>
          Or, (B) How have physical and economic factors influenced the distribution pattern of the Indian Railway Network? Explain with examples. [5]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (A) Pipeline transport network is a new arrival on the transportation map of India.
          <br/>
          In the past, the pipelines were used to transport water to cities and industries. Now these are used for transporting crude oil, petroleum products and natural gas from oil and natural gas fields to refineries, fertilizer factories and big thermal power plants. Solids can also be transported through a pipeline when converted into slurry.
         </p>
<p>
          For example, the inland locations of refineries like Barauni, Mathura, Panipat and gas based fertilizer plants could be possible only because of pipelines. India’s gas pipeline infrastructure has expanded from 1,700 km to 18,500 km of cross country pipelines. It rules out trans-shipment losses or delays.
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          (B) Factors that have affected the distribution pattern of railway network in India:
          <br/>
          (i) Physiographic factors. The Northern plains with vast level land, high population density and rich agricultural resources provide most favourable conditions for railway network. The nature of terrain and the number of rivers running through the region determine the density of railway network in this region. Mountains, marshy, sandy and forested areas have sparse network whereas plain areas have dense network of the railways. It was difficult to lay railway lines on the sandy plains of Western Rajasthan, swamps of Gujarat and forested tracks of Madhya Pradesh. Inspite of the unfavourable terrain, Indian Railways run on railways tracks extending over 68,000 kms.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Economic factors. Regions which have rich resources and are economically more developed have denser network of railways in comparison to the regions with low economic development.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) Administrative factors. The administrative and political decisions also have affected the distribution of railway network.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 32.
          <br/>
          (A) “Democracy stands much superior to any other forms of government in promoting dignity and freedom of the individual.” Support the statement with arguments. [5]
          <br/>
          Or, (B) “Democracy produces an accountable, responsive and legitimate government.” Support the statement with arguments.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (A) Examples to illustrate that dignity and freedom of citizens are best guaranteed in a democracy:
          <br/>
          (i) Democracy transforms people from the status of a subject into that of a citizen. A democracy is concerned with ensuring that people will have the right to choose their rulers and people will have control over the rulers. Whenever possible and necessary, citizens should be able to participate in decision-making that affects them all.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) A citizen has the right and the means to examine the process of decision-making. There is transparency in a democracy like India. In October 2005, the Right to Information (RTI) law was passed which ensures all its citizens the right to get all the information about the functions of the government departments. In a democracy, people also have the right to complain about its functioning.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) Democracy has strengthened the claims of disadvantaged and discriminated castes. When governments are formed, political parties usually take care that representatives of different castes and tribes find a place in it. Some political parties are known to favour some castes. Democracy provides for equal status and opportunities for all castes.
         </p>
<p>
          (iv) Dignity of women. Democracy recognises dignity of women as a necessary ingredient of society. The one way to ensure that women related problems get adequate attention is to have more women as elected representatives. To achieve this, it is legally binding to have a fair proportion of women in the elected bodies. Panchayati Raj in India has reserved one-third seats in local government bodies for women. In March 2010, the Women’s Reservation Bill was passed in the Rajya Sabha ensuring 33% reservation for women in Parliament and State legislative bodies.
          <br/>
          Or,
          <br/>
          (B) A democracy is concerned with ensuring that people have the right to choose their rulers and have control over the rulers.
          <br/>
          — When possible and necessary, citizens should be able to participate in decision making in a democracy.
          <br/>
          — Democracy ensures that decision-making is based on norms and procedures. A citizen has the right and the means to examine the process of decision-making. Thus democracy entails transparency.
          <br/>
          — For a democracy to produce an accountable, responsive and legitimate government, it must ensure the following:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Regular, free and fair elections.
          </li>
<li>
           Open public debate on major policies and legislations.
          </li>
<li>
           Citizens’ right to be informed about government policies.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (A) Role of self help groups (SHGs):
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           SHGs help borrowers overcome the problem of absence of collateral.
          </li>
<li>
           People can get timely loans for a variety of purposes and at a reasonable interest rate.
          </li>

          RAINWATER HARVESTING
          <br/>
          Many thought that given the disadvantages and rising resistance against the multi purpose projects, water harvesting system was a viable alternative, both socio-economically and environmentally. In ancient India, along with the sophisticated hydraulic structures, there existed an extraordinary tradition of water harvesting system. People had in-dep&gt;th knowledge of rainfall regimes and soil types and developed wide ranging techniques to harvest rainwater, groundwater, river water and flood water in keeping with the local ecological conditions and their water needs. In hill and mountainous regions, people built diversion channels like the ‘guls’ or ‘kuls’ of the Western Himalayas for agriculture.
         </p>
<p>
          ‘Rooftop rainwater harvesting’ was commonly practised to store drinking water, particularly in Rajasthan. In the flood plains of Bengal, people developed inundation channels to irrigate their fields. In arid and semi-arid regions, agricultural fields were converted into rain fed storage structures that allowed the water to stand and moisten the soil like How many languages do we have in India? The answer depends on how one counts it.
         </p>
<p>
          The latest information that we have is from the Census of India held in 2011. This census recorded more than 1300 distinct languages which people mentioned as their mother tongues. These languages were grouped together under some major languages. For example languages like Bhojpuri, Magadhi, Bundelkhandi, Chhattisgarhi, Rajasthani and many others were grouped together under ‘Hindi’. Even after this grouping, the Census found 121 major languages. Of these 22 languages are now the most diverse country in the world.

          Language Diversity of India
          <br/>
          How many languages do we have in India? The answer depends on how one counts it. The latest information that we have is from the Census of India held in 2011.

For example languages like Bhojpuri, Magadhi, Bundelkhandi, Chhattisgarhi, Rajasthani and many others were grouped together under ‘Hindi’. Even after this grouping, the Census found 121 major languages. Of these 22 languages are now included in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution and are therefore called ‘Scheduled Languages’. Others are called ‘Non-Scheduled Languages’. In terms of languages, India is perhaps the most diverse country in the world.

          <br/>
          Non-scheduled languages.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) The diverse languages and cultures of India have blended together to create a shared sense of national identity. One example of this fusion can be seen in Bollywood films.

          Answer:
          <br/>
          After an industrial activity starts, urbanisation follows. Some industries are located in and around the cities. Thus industrialisation and urbanisation go hand in hand. Cities provide markets, services such as banking, insurance, transport, labour, consultancy and financial advice, etc. to industries. Many industries tend to come together to make use of the advantages offered by the urban centres known as ‘agglomeration economies’. Gradually, a large industrial agglomeration or clustering takes place around an urban centres.

          Explain the role of Regional Parties in Indian democracy. [3]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The state parties also referred to as Regional parties are not necessarily regional in ideology. Some of these parties are All India parties that happen to have succeeded only in some states. Over the’last three decades, the number and strength of these parties has expanded. As a result, the National parties were compelled to form alliances with state parties. Since 1996, nearly every one of the State parties got an opportunity to be a part of one or the other National level coalition government. This contributed to the strengthening of federalism and democracy. Example of state parties having National level political organisations with units in several states are Samajwadi Party (SP), Rashtriya Janata Dal, Samata Party.

          Question 30.
          <br/>
          (A) “Gandhiji felt the Khilafat issue as an opportunity to bring Hindus and Muslims under the umbrella of a unified national movement.” Explain the statement. [5]
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          (B) Explain the participation of women in the ‘Civil Disobedience Movement’. [5]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (A) Khilafat Movement was organized by the famous Ali Brothers, i.e., Muhammad Ali and Shaukat Ali, to protest against injustice done to Turkey (one of the defeated countries in the First World War) after the war. This had created a great indignation among Muslim masses. The Sultan of Turkey was also considered the Caliph or Khalifa, the religious head of the Muslims and there was a rumour that a harsh peace treaty was going to be imposed on him. To defend the Khalifa’s temporal powers, a Khilafat Committee was formed in Bombay in March 1919.
         </p>
<p>
          This issue was made part of the Indian Nationalist Movement. Gandhiji, who wanted to launch a more broad-based movement, felt that this is the opportunity to bring the Hindus and Muslims under the umbrella of a unified national movement. Thus, Gandhiji took up the Khilafat issue. He also convinced other leaders that there was a need to start a Non-cooperation Movement in support of Khilafat Movement. Both the movements merged and came to be known as Khilafat-Non-cooperation Movement.
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          (B) Moved by Gandhiji’s call, women began to see service to the nation as a scared duty. But, this increased public role did not mean any radical change in the position of women. Gandhiji was convinced that it was the duty of the women to look after their homes, be good mothers and wives.
          <br/>
          Congress, too for a long time was reluctant to allow women to hold any position of authority within the organisation. It was keen only on their symbolic presence.

          Question 28.
          <br/>
          Explain the merits of Multi-party System. [3]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Multi-party system. In this system, the government is formed by various parties coming together in a coalition. When several parties in a multi-party system join hands for the purpose of contesting elections and winning power, it is called an alliance or a front.
          <br/>
          Merits of Multi-party system:
          <br/>
          (i) This system appears messy and leads to political instability. But, at the same time, it allows for à variety of interests and opinions to enjoy political representation.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Each country develops a party system that is conditioned by its special circumstances. If India has evolved as a multi-party system, it is because its social and geographical diversity cannot be absorbed by two or three parties. Thus, such representation of social diversity strengthens democracy.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) Multi-party system facilitates representation of regional and geographical diversities. In India, several regional parties have been in power at the State level such as the DMK in Tamil Nadu, Akali Dal in Punjab and BSP and Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh.
