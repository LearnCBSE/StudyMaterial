          Question 1.
          <br/>
          Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follow: [10]
          <br/>
          A. It is common knowledge that school children are under great pressure to perform well in all fields, study ten subjects, play games and develop an impressive image. How do they manage? The skills, techniques and principles which they pick up while still young help them cope.
         </p>
<p>
          B. Two of the twentieth century’s finest minds have lamented that schools are not teaching the basics of personal excellence or the science of success. Edward De Bono: “Almost all of what a child learns at school after the age of ten is totally irrelevant to his need in later life. Most schools do not teach thinking at all.” The serious thesis of this article is that management must be taught as a school subject. The weightiest argument is that children are managers.
         </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
          C. Many of the children are called upon to play directly three of the interpersonal roles: “Figurehead”, “Leader” and “Liaison Officer”. They do this while assisting teachers as monitors or class representatives or group leaders during educational tours and field work; while captaining teams on playgrounds; and while leading teams in quiz, debating and other competitions. Many more play these roles as surrogates.

</p>
<p>
          D. The decision role of “Entrepreneur” and “Resource Allocator” may only occasionally be assigned to children. However, it is worth noting that, according to a recent survey in Delhi, a monthly allocation of up to ?1,000 is available as pocket money to school children. Therefore, school children too need to have control over money and develop a sense of budget. If we add to these financial resources, the resources of time, information and intellect available to children, the first two decision roles are not irrelevant to them.
         </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
          F. If you cannot see children as managers, they are managers in the making: Many of the management habits (e.g., using a to-do list), management skills (e.g., sensitive listening), management attitudes and values are formed early in life. Personality theorists believe that it is extremely difficult to change personality traits, styles of thinking and habits of behaviour once these are formed.
         </p>
<p>
          G. As in language learning, where basic aspects of language like pronunciation and rhythm are extremely resistant to learning after puberty, good management habits, attitudes and values are difficult to acquire in adulthood. In the fifties, even in the educationally advanced countries such as the US, Algebra was thought to be too abstract to be taught even in senior schools.
         </p>

          Now it is taught from upper primary classes onwards in both educationally progressive and developing countries. Computer skills, lateral thinking and swimming, often felt to be forbidden by adults are easily learnt by children. In fact, both research evidence and specialists’ beliefs strongly support the view that children’s ability to learn skills like swimming and creative thinking is much more developed than adults. Equally important, complex organisms.

         </p>
<p>
          Question 3.
          <br/>

          <br/>
          Explanation: It is worth noting that according to a recent survey in Delhi, a monthly allocation of up to Rs. 1,000 is available as pocket money to school children. Therefore, school children too need to have control over money and develop a sense of budget.

          Question 6.
          <br/>
          Which subject was considered to be too intangible to be taught in higher schools in the US?
          <br/>
          (A) Science

However, the perception changed over time, and now it is taught from upper primary classes onwards. So, Algebra was the subject that was initially considered too intangible to be taught at higher school levels in the US.

<span style="color: #0000ff;">
           2. Read the following passage: [1 x 8 = 8]
          </span>
</p>
<p>
          A. The world’s first book-less library has been set up in the state of Texas in the United States. Unlike the rows upon rows of books that are found in a conventional library anywhere in the world, at the book-less library, there are high-tech gadgets that have replaced the books as found in other libraries.
         </p>
<p>
          B. The borrowers of books from this high-tech book-less library have a different set of rules to follow when borrowing books. Instead of taking home books for reading, the members of the library, who are registered residents of the south Texas country of Buxar, can now access their choice of reading matter from e-readers. Also, instead of having to pay a fee for membership of the library and for borrowing books and other facilities, the members can borrow reading matter from the book-less library for free.
         </p>
<p>
          C. The services of this library have found favour with its readers which is clearly visible from the growing readership numbers at this library. Since its start in September, the country’s 1.7 million residents have been able to check out and take home the machines for reading purposes and accessing the catalogue. They are also able to use their own devices to check out and access the catalogue of the library. This Biblio-Tech of 1.5 million books, currently has 600 e-readers, 200 pre-loaded enhanced e-readers for children and 48 computer stations for use by its readers. In addition, there are 10 laptops, and 40 tablets available in the premises, for use by the readers.
         </p>
<p>
          D. Not satisfied with simply providing e-reading services, the Biblio-Tech has created a list of higher ambitions for itself. The most prominent of these include their ambition to give up the country’s necessary tools ‘to thrive as citizens of the 21st century’. For them, a well-connected citizen of this country is one who strives for enhancing his education and literacy and promoting ‘reading as a recreation’.
         </p>
<p>
          E. As part of reader services at the Biblio-Tech, its Special Project Coordinator, Laura Cole comments that the library authorities wanted to create the best and the most cost-effective way of providing library services. This was especially suitable for the Texas country’s residents as the population here is geographically distanced from existing services. In fact there has never been a book store or library in this area. “Geography does not matter if your library is in the clouds,” adds Laura Cole, referring to the ‘cloud’ system where the books of the library are stored online.
         </p>
<p>
          F. Answering queries about readers’ concerns that library users may feel put off by technology, Cole is proud to concur that her staff is willing to dedicate their time to help readers and visitors who find it difficult to handle the system on their own. Hence, readers do not feel intimidated by the gadgetry and feel empowered to be able to access this novel system of procuring reading matter.
         </p>
<p>
          G. Even replacement costs for damages and breakdowns have been factored into the working system of the library. Thus, readers are not turned away from the library doors simply because the system is not functioning on any particular day. To prevent thefts from depleting their stocks, the devices are geared in such a way that users cannot access the internet once they leave the premises of the library.

         </p>
<p>
<span style="color: #0000ff;">
           3. Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow:
          </span>
</p>
<p>
          A. Every code of etiquette has contained three elements: basic moral duties; practical rules which promote efficiency; and artificial optional graces such as formal compliments to say, superiors on their generosity and importance.
         </p>
<p>
          B. In the first category, consideration for the weak and respect for age. Among the ancient Egyptians, the young always stood in the presence of older people. Among the Mpongwe of Tanzania, the young men bow as they pass the huts of the elders. In England, until about a century ago, young children did not sit in their parents’ presence without taking permission.
         </p>
<p>
          C. Practical rules are helpful in such ordinary occurrences of social life as making proper introductions at parties or other functions so that people can be brought to know each other. Before the invention of the folk, etiquette directed that the fingers should be kept as clean as possible; before the handkerchief came into common use, etiquette suggested that, after spitting, a person should rub the spit inconspicuously underfoot.
         </p>
<p>
          D. Extremely refined behaviour, however, cultivated as an art of gracious living, has been a characteristic only of societies with wealth and leisure, which admitted women as the social equals of men.
         </p>
<p>
          E. In fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, a wealthy and leisured society developed an extremely complex code of manners, but the rules of behaviour of fashionable society had little influence on the daily life of the lower classes. Indeed many of the rules, such as how to enter a banquet room, or how to use a sword or handkerchief for ceremonial purposes, were irrelevant to the way of life of the average working man who spent most of his life outdoors or in his own poor hut and most probably did not have a handkerchief certainly not a sword, to his name.
         </p>
<p>
<img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 11 English Set 1 with Solutions" height="16" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Learn-CBSE.png" width="116"/>
</p>
<p>
          F. Yet the essential basis of all good manners does not vary. Consideration for the old and the weak and the avoidance of harming or giving unnecessary offence to others is a feature of all societies everywhere and at all levels from the highest to the lowest. You can easily think of dozens of examples of customs and habits in your own daily life which come under this heading.
          <br/>
          (a) On the basis of your reading the passage, make notes using recognisable abbreviations wherever necessary. Use a format you consider suitable, and supply a suitable title.
          <br/>
          (b) Make a short summary of the passage in about 50 words.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) RIGHT Elements of Etiquettes
          <br/>
          1. Basic moral duties:
          <br/>
          1.1. Consdr’tion. for the weak and respect for age

          Question 8.
          <br/>
          There was a time when children could be seen playing outdoor games like Hide and Seek, Football, etc. But now-a-days they are very much pre-occupied with chatting on mobiles, surfing the internet and watching TV. Outdoor games are very necessary as they keep one physically fit. Write a speech to be delivered in the morning assembly on ‘Games are very necessary for holistic growth’ in about 120-150 words.
          <br/>
          Answer:
         </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
          Games are Very Necessary For Holistic Growth
         </p>
<p>
          Good morning respected Principal, teachers and my dear friends. Today, I, Arpita Mittal of class XI-B stand before you to present my views on ‘Games are very necessary for holistic growth.’ Holistic growth focuses on the fullest development of the student, encouraging students to become the very best or finest that they can be and enabling them to experience all they can from life and reach their goals.
         </p>
<p>
          Physical activity is vital to the holistic development of young people, fostering their physical social and emotional health. The benefits of sports reach beyond the impact on physical well-being and the value of educational benefits of sports should not be underestimated. Children in the earlier days always enjoyed playing outdoor games like Hide and Seek, Football, Cricket, etc.
         </p>
<p>
          But now children rather love to stay indoors stuck with their internet, TV and mobiles which do not keep them physically fit. Participating outdoor games or activities is a vital avenue for young people to learn and develop life skills. Physical education and sports have strong influence on inclusion and community building, character-building, deLinquency, etc. So I would strongly suggest that games are very necessary for holistic growth or for an overall development.
          <br/>
          Thank you.

          Regular practice of yoga is useful in maintaining good health. It is also important for good concentration and peace of mind. You are Shivam/Shabnam. Write a speech in 120-150 words to be delivered in the morning assembly of your school, highlighting the impact of yoga in our life.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Impact of YOGA in daily life
          <br/>
          Very Good Morning to all of you. I, Shivam from class XI, am going to express my views on the topic ‘Impact of YOGA in daily life.” Practicing yoga in daily life provides us with a healthy body and mind. The energy acquired from the postures bring both mental peace and physical balance.
         </p>
<p>
          To gain strength, increase flexibility and attain spirituality, yoga is the foremost method to achieve them. Meditation also helps us keep our mind fresh and our body fit and healthy for the long run. In the race of materialism, adults face stress in many forms every day, but today’s children are as stressed as adults. Growing competition in schools and colleges, dealing with peer pressure, difficult stage of puberty, extracurricular activities and meeting parents’ and teachers’ expectations are very stressful for children.
         </p>
<p>
          The best way you can cope with this pressure is by practicing yoga. The practice of yoga leaves a huge effect on your body and the systems that support it, like the nervous, respiratory and digestive systems. Yoga influences emotions and behaviour. It has a positive effect on the mental state and aids creativity. So everyone must practice yoga and make it a part of their daily routine. At last, I say that, ‘Yoga is the golden key that unlocks the door to peace, tranquillity, joy and health.”
          <br/>
          Thank you

          Answer:
         </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
          Our Large Population is not a Cause of Poverty but an Asset
         </p>
<p>
          A very good morning to all the Jury Members, Friends and Fellow Opponents. Today, I, XYZ of class 12, would like to express my views against the motion ‘Our large population is not a cause of poverty, but an asset.’ I will speak against the topic. Be it IT jobs, sales, HP or marketing, job hunters frantically crowd at job fairs and career seminars. The literates, skilled and semi- skilled try their hand digitally or knock at various doors for the so-called interview.
         </p>
<p>
          Yes, this is a fact. Dear friends, due to unchecked population, unemployment has become a serious social issue and the major challenge for the State and Central Governments. With the population reaching 1.3 billion and with more and more hungry mouths to feed, natural and man-made resources are unable to cope with the rising demand for food, shelter and clothing.
         </p>
<p>
          Poverty is glaring at our face even in the supersonic age. Reason? Our large population. Twenty two per cent of population is still below poverty tline, according to officiaL statistics. To add more, theft, kidnapping, rape,robbery and burglary in most cases are committed by the migrant labourers living in slums on the outskirts of towns and cities.
         </p>
<p>
          Many a time, the teeming, unregistered population find their names in the voters’ list just to be used as muscle power by unethical political leaders, creating a class of hoodlums and assassins only. With a question, I put an end to my words. Are these thieves, murderers, robbers, hoodlums and assassins’ assets? We all know the answer.
          <br/>
          Thank you.

          Animal Dissection should be Banned
          <br/>
          The Government has banned the dissection of animals in laboratories. Good morning everyone, I am Navtej and I am going to speak in favour of the motion Animal testing should be banned’. In our laboratories, animals are dissected, despite the fact that their dissection is cruel and unpleasant. It is absolutely unethical.
         </p>

</p>
<p>
          At the same time, it teaches children to abuse animals. On one hand, organisations like PETA are fighting for the protection from cruelty on these speechless beings, and on the other hand, they are being killed mercilessly in the name of experiments. It is not only cruel but also unwise to use them for this purpose. Before reaching the laboratories, the animals are stockpiled on the top of one another.

With land under my feet again, my thoughts were full of Larry and Herbie, cheerful and optimistic under the direst stress, and of Mary, who stayed at the wheel for all those crucial hours. Most of all, I thought of a seven-year-old girl, who did not want us to worry about a head injury (which subsequently took six minor operations to remove a recurring blood clot between skin and skull), and of a six-year-old boy who was not afraid to die.

          When was the photo taken? What did it show?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The goldfinch chirps and suddenly settles on the end of a branch on the top of the laburnum tree. Then quite suddenly and watchfully she enters the middle part of the tree. She moves smoothly like a lizard. Then the tree is filled up with a series of short, quick high pitched chattering sounds, shaking of wings and quavering sound. The whole tree shakes slightly and is excited. It seems as if a whole machine has started working. This thickness of the tree houses the family of goldfinch and she stokes the engine of her family before leaving the tree and flying off to the infinite. The laburnum top regains its silence and stillness.
          <br/>

          <br/>
          OR
          <br/>
          Professor Gaitonde noticed an imposing building facing Bombay V.T., called East India House, Headquarters of the East India Company.

          The doctor lay the child on a blanket and began the special method of respiration. Then he immersed it alternately in cold water and lukewarm water. Fifteen minutes passed, but no breath came from the body of the child. Then the doctor made one last effort. He rubbed the child with a towel, crushed and released the chest with both his hands.

          “He was the last of his family line. ” What do you learn about Tut’s dynasty from the extract ‘Discovering Tut : The Saga Continues’?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Tut’s grandfather, Amenhotep III was a powerful Pharaoh who ruled for almost four decades at the height of the dynasty’s golden age. His son Amenhotep IV promoted the worship of the Aten, the sun disk. He changed his ‘name to Akhenaten or ‘servant of the Aten. ‘ He moved his religious capital from the old city.
         </p>
<p>
          Thebes to the new city of Akhenaten. He further shocked the country by attacking Amun, a major God, breaking his images and closing his temples. Thus, the wacky King started one of the strongest periods in the history of ancient Egypt. After Akhenaten’s death a mysterious ruler named Smenkhare appeared briefly and departed without leaving any sign. Then a very young Tutankhaten took the throne.
         </p>
<p>
          He is widely known today as King Tut. The boy King soon changed his name to Tutankhamun ‘living image of Amun’. He supervised the restoration of the old ways. Tutankhamun ruled for about nine years and then died unexpectedly. The details of his passing away are not available. The modern world has speculated about what might have happened to him. How did he die and how old was he at the time of his death are two unanswered questions.

          Question 16.
          <br/>
          Answer any one of the following questions in about 120-150 words: [6 x 1 = 6]
          <br/>
          Describe the narrator’s experience of early morning ride with his cousin Mourad.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          It was summer early morning. The narrator’s cousin Mourad came to his house. He was sitting on a beautiful white horse. He invited the narrator to enjoy a ride. The narrator got ready and leaped onto the horse behind Mourad. In less than three minutes, they were in the open. The horse began to snort. They let the horse run as long as it felt like running. Then, Mourad asked the narrator to get down as he wanted to ride alone.
         </p>
<p>
          The narrator agreed on the condition that Mourad would let him also try to ride alone. Mourad kicked his heels into the horse. The horse stood on its hind legs, snorted, and began to run. Mourad made the horse run across a field of dry grass to an irrigation ditch. He crossed the ditch on the horse. Five minutes later, he returned. Now it was the narrator’s turn to ride alone.
         </p>
<p>
          When he got onto the back of the horse, it ran down the road to a vineyard instead of running across the field to the irrigation ditch. It began to leap over vines. It had hardly leaped over seven vines when the narrator fell off. The horse kept running and then disappeared. It took Mourad half an hour to trace the horse and bring it back.

          How does Mrs. Pearson behave towards her husband after she changes her personality with that of Mrs. Fitzgerald?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          When George enters the room, he is astonished to see her sipping stout as he has never seen her doing it before. He informs her that he doesn’t want any tea as he would have supper at the club. His wife tells him impudently that there is no tea ready. He is annoyed to know that his wife didn’t get tea ready for him. She laughs at his childishness and remarks that if he behaved like that the club would laugh at him even more than they do now.
         </p>
<p>
          He is surprised to hear that they laugh at him at the club. Mrs. Pearson continues that he is one of their standing jokes and they call him Pompy-Ompy Pearson because they think he is so slow and pompous. She wonders why he wants to spend so much time at a place where they are always laughing at him behind his back and calling him names. George is horrified at the revelations.
         </p>

</p>
<p>
          Later, Mrs. Fitzgerald visits their house. Since, she addresses him informally as ‘George’, George is annoyed. Making fun of him, Mrs. Pearson remarks that it makes little difference whether he is addressed as ‘George Pearson’ or ‘George.’ Then she asks him whether he thinks he is Duke of Edingburg. George stands against at this disparaging behaviour of her wife.
