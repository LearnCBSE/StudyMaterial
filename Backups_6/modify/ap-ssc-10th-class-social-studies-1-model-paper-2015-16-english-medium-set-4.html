           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            A.1)
           </strong>
           The formation of the Himalayas influences the climate in various ways.
           <br/>
           2) These act as barriers protecting the great plains of India from the cold winds of central Asia during severe winter.
           <br/>
           3) The Himalayas are reason for summer rains and monsoon type climate in regions that are beyond the Western Ghats of India.
           <br/>
           4) The Himalayan rivers have a perennial flow since these are fed by the glaciers.

<strong>
            A.
           </strong>
           Yes, we can say Ford Motors is an MNC, because its production units have spread over 26 countries of the world. This is the most important feature of an MNC.

           Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. In other words, a better quality of life for everyone – now and for generations to come.

<strong>
            6. Water, a natural resource for production, particularly agricultural production, now requires greater capital for its use. Can you explain the statement ?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            A.
           </strong>
           1) Agriculture is a major user of water resources and the consumption of water is increasing day by day.
           <br/>
           2) Indian agriculture mainly depends on rains which are unpredictable.
           <br/>
           3) As a result the agriculture has to depend on irrigation facilities such as dams, anicuts, checkdams, bunds, pools, etc. which are most expensive to construct.
           <br/>
           4) On the other hand, the farmers are depending on groundwater resources. Lifting the groundwater to surface is also very expensive.
           <br/>
           So I can say that water, a natural resource for production, particularly agricultural production now requires greater capital for its use.

           </strong>
           1) Even though per capita income is high in many states, education and health facilities are still lacking.
           <br/>
           2) Money or high per capita income cannot buy a pollution free environment or good health.
           <br/>
           3) Money cannot buy peace and democracy.

<br/>
<strong>
            A.

           </strong>

<strong>
            A.
           </strong>
           Forests through photosynthesis absorb carbon dioxide (C0
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           ) and release oxygen (0
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           ). The timber of the trees also sequesters carbon. Deforestation means the tim­ber may be used and eventually converted to carbon dioxide, or left to rot, which also means that it is converted to C0
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           , a green house gas responsible for global warming. Similarly the green leaves no longer act as carbon sinks to suck in C0
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           . Either way, deforestation contributes to the global warming process.
           <br/>
           Deforestation = Fewer trees = More C0
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           = Enhanced greenhouse effect = Global warming.

<strong>
            16. “The groundwater laws are both outdated and inappropriate.” Explain the statement in brief.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            A.
           </strong>
           Groundwater has become the main source of water for all the main uses of water. This tremendous increase has significant impacts on water availability and on access to water. The current regulatory regime is in large part still based on principles inherited from the colonial period. These are both outdated and inappropriate. They are outdated because they were developed at a time when groundwater was a marginal source of water and when humans were not able to affect the level of the ground water table through their use which was largely limited to drawing water from wells.
           <br/>
           They are inappropriate because the basic nexus between access to groundwater and land ownership on which these rules are based make common law rules socially inequitable and environmentally unsustainable.

            19. What do you understand by underemployment? Explain with an example each from the urban and rural areas.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            A.
           </strong>
           Disguised unemployment is a kind of unemployment in which there are people who are visibly employed but are actually unemployed. This is also known as Hidden Unemployment. In such a situation more people are engaged in a work than required.
           <br/>
           In rural areas, this type of unemployment is generally found in agricultural sector, e.g.: In a family of 8 people all are engaged in the same agricultural plot. But 3 people are withdrawn from it. There will be no reduction in output. So these 3 people are actually disguisedly in unemployment.
           <br/>
           In urban areas, this type of unemployment can be seen mostly in service sectors such as in a family all numbers are engaged in one petty shop or a small business which can be managed by less number of persons.

            20. What do you think would be the environmental and human costs of rapid growth in mining ?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            A.
           </strong>
           1) Rapid growth in mining would have a negative impact on the environment as well as at the human cost.
           <br/>
           2) Mines are dug deep, so the layers of earth become weak.
           <br/>
           3) They may cause landslides, avalanches, earthquakes, etc.
           <br/>
           4) Most of the water is used in the process of digging and later process also.
           <br/>
           5) Post liberalisation era brought private people (companies) into mining activities.
           <br/>
           6) Accidents may occur, tunnel may fall down, or get flooded with water or there can be fire and suffocation due to gases – these dangers may be faced in mining.
           <br/>
           7) With the motto of earning profits, these companies do not take proper measures of safety.
           <br/>
           8) Thus, there may be many human losses in rapid extractions of minerals.

            21. Give reasons to argue for the following statement “Public Distribution System can ensure better food security for people”.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            A.
           </strong>
           It is a joint responsibility of central government, state government and union territory administration to ensure the smooth functioning of the PDS.
           <br/>
           While the responsibility of central government is to procure, store and transport it from purchase points to central godowns, the responsibility of state government and union territory administrations is to lift these commodities from the central godowns and distribute them to consumers through the network of fair price shops. FC1 procures and distributes foodgrains, to provide subsidized food to the poor to mitigate regional inequalities through moving the surplus food to deficit areas and to stabilize agricultural prices.
           <br/>
           The universal coverage of PDS was replaced by Targeted real Public Distribution system in 1997 in order to achieve the objective of food security through sale of foodgrains to APT householders at economic cost and confirming the food subsidy bill toward the identified BPL families whose number crossed 97 million families in 2007.
