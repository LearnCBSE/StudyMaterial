           Question 35.
           <br/>
           Why is energy required for all activities? How can energy be generated? Explain. (2014 D)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Energy is needed to cook, to provide light and heat, to propel vehicles and to drive machinery in industries. Energy is a basic requirement for economic development. Every sector of the national economy—agriculture, industry and transport—commercial and domestic needs inputs of energy.
           <br/>
           Energy can be generated from fuel minerals like coal, petroleum, natural gas, uranium and from electricity. Conventional sources like firewood and cattledung cakes are most commonly used in rural India to generate energy.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Three values that can help to prevent Environmental Degradation:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            We must ensure sustainable and equitable use of resources without degrading the environment or risking health or safety.
           </li>
<li>
            We must raise awareness and consciousness among people about the importance of judicious use of resources to prevent degradation of land, water, vegetation and air.
           </li>
<li>
            The following measures must be adopted to prevent environmental degradation:
            <ul>
<li>
              Minimising use of water for processing by reusing and recycling it.
             </li>
<li>
              Smoke can be reduced by using oil or gas instead of coal in factories.
             </li>
<li>
              Almost all machinery can be redesigned to increase energy efficiency and reduce noise.

           Question 37.
           <br/>
           Which is the most abundantly available fossil fuel in India? Mention its different forms. (2015 OD, 2014 OD, 2008)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The most abundantly available fossil fuel is Coal.
           <br/>
           There are four types of coal:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Anthracite. It is the highest quality hard coal. It contains more than 80% carbon content. It gives less smoke.
           </li>
<li>
            Bituminous. It is the most popular coal in commercial use and has 60-80% carbon content. Metallurgical coal is high grade bituminous coal and is of special value for smelting iron in blast furnaces.
           </li>
<li>
            Lignite. It is a low grade brown coal. It is soft with high moisture content.
           </li>
<li>
            Peat. It has a low carbon and high moisture content. It has low heating capacity and gives lot of smoke on burning.

           Question 38.
           <br/>
           How is the mining activity injurious to the health of the miners and environment? Explain. (2015 D)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Adverse effect on health: The dust and noxious fumes inhaled by miners make them vulnerable to pulmonary diseases.
           <br/>
           The risk of collapsing mine roofs, inundation and fires in coal mines are a constant threat to miners.
           <br/>
           Adverse effects on the environment:
          </p>
<p>
           The water sources in the region get contaminated due to mining.
          </p>
<p>
           Dumping of slurry and waste leads to degradation of land, soil and increase in stream and river pollution. Stricter safety regulations and implementation of environmental laws are essential to prevent mining from becoming a ‘killer industry’.

            India is a tropical country and gets abundant sunshine.
           </li>
<li>
            It has enormous possibilities of tapping solar energy.
           </li>
<li>
            It is an inexhaustible source of energy which is freely available in nature.
           </li>
<li>
            It is a cheaper source of energy and is fast becoming popular in rural and remote areas.
           </li>
<li>
            Photovaltic technology is available which converts sunlight directly into electricity.
           </li>
<li>
            Because of its abundant and free availability in all parts of India in addition to its ecofriendly nature, solar energy is called the energy of future.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Also use of solar energy will minimise the dependence of rural households on firewood. It will contribute to environmental conservation and reduce pressure on conventional sources of energy.

           Question 41.
           <br/>
           ‘Consumption of energy in all forms has been rising all over the country. There is an urgent need to develop a sustainable path of energy development and energy saving/ Suggest and explain any three measures to solve this burning problem. (2016 OD)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Every sector of the national economy—agriculture, industry, transport, (commercial and domestic), needs greater inputs of energy.
          </p>
<p>
           With increasing population and changing lifestyles energy consumption is increasing very fast. We are not self sufficient in energy according to demands. Therefore we have to adopt a cautious approach for the judicious use of our limited resources. Conservation of energy should be done at all levels.
           <br/>
           Three measures to reduce consumption of energy in all forms:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            We can do our bit by using public transport systems instead of individual vehicles.
           </li>
<li>
            Switching off electricity when not in use.
           </li>
<li>
            Using power saving devices or using non-conventional sources of energy such as solar energy, wind energy etc.
           </li>
<li>
            Checking the power equipments regularly can help in saving of energy.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Question 42.
           <br/>
           What are the main types of formations in which minerals occur?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Minerals generally occur in the following forms:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Veins and lodes. In igneous and metamorphic rocks minerals may occur in the cracks, faults or joints by getting solidified in them. The smaller occurrences are called veins and the larger lodes, eg., metallic minerals like tin, copper, zinc and lead etc. are found in lodes and veins.
           </li>
<li>
            In sedimentary rocks minerals occur in beds or layers. They are formed as a result of deposition, accumulation and concentration in horizontal strata. Some sedimentary minerals are formed as a result of evaporation, especially in arid regions eg., gypsum, potash and salt.
           </li>
<li>
            Another mode of formation involves decomposition of surface rocks and the removal of soluble contents, leaving a residual mass of weathered material containing ores. Bauxite is formed this way.
           </li>
<li>
            Placer deposits. Certain minerals occur as alluvial deposits in sands of valley floors and the base of hills, eg., gold, silver, tin and platinum. These are called placer deposits and contain minerals which are not corroded by water.
           </li>
<li>
            Ocean waters contain vast quantities of minerals, eg., common salt, magnesium and bromide are largely derived from the ocean waters. The ocean beds are rich in manganese nodules.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Question 43.
           <br/>
           Why is there a pressing need to use renewable energy resources in India? Explain any five reasons. (2013 OD)
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            The growing consumption of energy has resulted in India becoming increasingly dependent on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas which are found in limited quantity on the earth. So there is an urgent need to use sustainable energy resources like solar, water, wind etc.
           </li>
<li>
            Rising prices of oil and gas and their potential shortages have raised uncertainties about the security of energy supply in future, which in turn has serious repercussions on the growth of the national economy.
           </li>
<li>
            Increasing use of fossil fuels also causes serious environmental degradation like air pollution, water pollution etc.
           </li>
<li>
            Renewable sources of energy are pollution free and do not cause harm to ozone, therefore they are eco-friendly.
           </li>
<li>
            They are a cheaper source and are freely and abundantly available in nature.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Question 44.
           <br/>
           How is energy a basic requirement for the economic development of the country? Explain with examples. (2013 OD)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Reasons:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Energy is the basic requirement for economic development.
           </li>
<li>
            Every sector of national economy—agriculture, industry, transport and commerce needs greater inputs of energy.
           </li>
<li>
            In the domestic sector also, energy demands, in the form of electricity, are growing because of increasing use of electric gadgets and appliances.
           </li>
<li>
            The economic development plans implemented since independence necessarily required increasing amounts of energy.
           </li>
<li>
            Because of all these, per capita consumption of energy is continuously increasing.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Question 45.
           <br/>
           Why is it necessary to conserve mineral resources? Suggest any four ways to conserve mineral resources. (2013 OD, 2012 OD, 2017 OD)
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Explain the importance of conversation of minerals. Highlight any three measures to conserve them. (2016 OD)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Conservation of minerals is necessary because of the following reasons:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            The formation of minerals takes a long geological period of millions of years.
           </li>
<li>
            They are finite, i.e., limited in nature.
           </li>
<li>
            Many of them are non-renewable and exhaustible.
           </li>
<li>
            The rate of replenishment of minerals is infinitely small in comparison to rate of consumption.
           </li>
<li>
            They have to be preserved for our future generations because they are very important for industrial development of the nation.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Ways to mineral conservation:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            We should use minerals in a planned and sustainable manner.
           </li>
<li>
            Improved technologies need to be evolved to allow use of low grade ores at low cost.
           </li>
<li>
            Recycling of metals should be done.
           </li>
<li>
            Using scrap metals and other substitutes should be promoted.
           </li>
<li>
            Wastages in mining, processing and distribution should be minimized.
           </li>
<li>
            Controlled export of minerals should be undertaken.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Question 46.
           <br/>
           “There is an urgent need to develop a sustainable path of energy development.” Give two broad measures for it. As concerned citizens, how can you help conserve energy? (2012 D, 2011 OD)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Two broad measures to develop a sustainable path of energy development are:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            We have to adopt a cautious approach for the judicious use of our limited energy resources. So conservation of energy should be done at all levels.
           </li>
<li>
            Increased use of renewable energy resources, e.g., solar energy, hydel power, etc.
            <br/>
            Concerned citizens can help conserve energy in the following ways:
            <ul>
<li>
              Using more of public transport system instead of individual vehicles.
             </li>
<li>
              Switching off electricity when not in use.
             </li>
<li>
              Using power saving devices.
             </li>
<li>
              Using non-conventional sources of energy such as solar energy, wind energy etc.
             </li>
<li>
              Getting the power equipment regularly checked to detect damages and leakages.
             </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
           Question 47.
           <br/>
           Highlight the importance of petroleum. Explain the occurrence of petroleum in India. (2016 D)
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Which is the next major source of energy after coal in India? Describe any three advantages of it. (2017 OD, 2008)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Importance of Petroleum in India:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            It is the second most important energy source of India after coal. It can be easily transported by pipelines and does not leave any residue. This property of petroleum gives it an added advantage in its use over other fuels.
           </li>
<li>
            It provides fuel for heat and light.
           </li>
<li>
            It provides lubricants for machinery.
           </li>
<li>
            It provides raw material for a number of manufacturing industries.
           </li>
<li>
            It is an important fuel used in transportation sector.
           </li>
<li>
            Petroleum refineries act as a ‘nodal industry’ for synthetic textiles, fertilizers and many chemical industries.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Occurrence of Petroleum in India:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Most of the petroleum occurrences in India are associated with anticlines and fault traps in the rock formations of the tertiary age.
           </li>
<li>
            In regions of folding anticlines it occurs where oil is trapped in the crest of the upfold. The oil bearing layer is porous limestone or sandstone through which oil may flow.
           </li>
<li>
            Petroleum is also found in fault traps between porous and non-porous rocks.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Question 48.
           <br/>
           ‘Energy saved is energy produced.’ Assess the statement. (2017 D)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Energy saved is energy produced. We cannot keep on producing non-renewable resources like petrol, diesel and electricity. So the need of the hour is the better utilization of existing resources. Energy depletion has become a global phenomenon at present time. The biggest problem that man has to face in near future is the energy crisis.
          </p>
<p>
           The demand of energy is growing manyfold in the form of coal, oil, gas or electricity but the energy sources are becoming scarce and costlier. Nearly 97% of the world’s consumed energy is coming from fossil fuels, coal, petroleum and natural gas. Among the various strategies for meeting energy demand, the efficient use of energy and its conservation is the best solution .
           <br/>
           Following are some measures to conserve energy resources:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            We should try and use more and more public transport system instead of private vehicles.
           </li>
<li>
            Electronic devices must be switched off when not in use.
           </li>
<li>
            Reducing the consumption of non-renewable sources of energy.
           </li>
<li>
            Solar Power should be used to the maximum to generate electricity.
           </li>
<li>
            Recycling of goods and commodities can also help to conserve energy.
           </li>
</ol>
