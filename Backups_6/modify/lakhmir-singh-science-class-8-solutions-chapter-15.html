</div>
<p>
           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Name the device to detect electric charge on a body.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Electroscope is the device which is used to detect charge on a body. It is used for detecting, measuring and finding the nature of a charge.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 10.
           <br/>
           When an object is touched with the metal top of an electroscope, its aluminium leaves diverge. What conclusion do you get from this observation?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           If the leaves of the electroscope diverge or open up when an object is touched, the body is charged. The extent of divergence or opening up of the leaves is a measure of the charge on the body. A body with higher charge will cause greater opening up of the leaves.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 11.
           <br/>
           What name is given to the flash of light which occurs in the sky during the rainy season?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Lightening is the name given to the flash of light which occurs in the sky during the rainy season. The process of electric discharge between clouds and the earth or between different clouds causes lightning.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 12.
           <br/>
           Why should a person not stand under a tree during a thunderstorm?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Trees are usually the tallest objects around and have many pointy tips. The electric field is strong near the pointed tips. The current from a lightening may leave the tree and jump over to the person standing near the tree. The current will then follow from the body of the person on its way to the ground.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 13.
           <br/>
           Name the scientist who showed that lightning is electric in nature.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Benjamin Franklin is the scientist who showed that lightening is electric in nature. He discovered many things about lightening and was the first to show that a thunderstorm lets out electricity.

<p>
           Question 15.
           <br/>
           What name is given to the phenomenon in which the earth shakes suddenly for a very short time?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Earthquake is the phenomenon in which the earth shakes suddenly for a very short time. It is caused by a disturbance deep inside the earth’s crust.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 16.
           <br/>
           Name one destructive natural phenomenon which cannot be predicted in advance.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Earthquake is the destructive natural phenomenon which cannot be predicted in advance. The earthquakes can cause floods, landslides and tsunamis. Most earthquakes are caused by the movement of earth’s plates.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 17.
           <br/>
           List three states in India where earthquakes are more likely to occur.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The states in India where earthquakes are most likely to occur are Kashmir, Western and Central Himalayas, the whole of North-East, Rann of Kutch, Rajasthan and the Indo – Gangetic Plane.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 18.
           <br/>
           Name the instrument used to measure and record an earthquake.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Seismograph is the instrument which is used to measure and record an earthquake. The tremors produce waves on the surface of the earth. These are called seismic waves. These waves are recorded by the seismograph.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 19.
           <br/>
           What was the magnitude of Bhuj and Kashmir earthquakes on the Richter Scale?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The magnitude of Bhuj and Kashmir earthquakes on the Richter Scale was more than 7.5 The destructive earthquakes have magnitudes higher than 7 on the Richter scale.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 20.
           <br/>
           Name the scale on which the magnitude (or intensity) of an earthquake is expressed.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           There are a number of ways to measure the magnitude of an earthquake. But, the Richter magnitude scale (often shortened to Richter scale) is the most common standard of measurement for earthquakes.
          </p>
<p>
           The Richter scale is used to rate the magnitude of an earthquake, that is the amount of energy released during an earthquake.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 21.
           <br/>
           For what purpose is the Richter Scale used?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Richter scale is used to measure the magnitude (or intensity) of an earthquake. It measures the power of an earthquake. The destructive earthquakes have magnitudes higher than 7 on the Richter scale.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 22.
           <br/>
           Name two events (other than earthquakes) which can cause tremors on the earth.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The tremors on the earth can be caused when a volcano erupts or when a meteor hits the earth. It can also be caused by an underground nuclear explosion.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 23.
           <br/>
           In the context of an earthquake, which one is deep under the ground: focus or epicentre?
           <br/>

           Question 26.
           <br/>
           Why does a plastic comb rubbed with dry hair attract tiny pieces of paper?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The electric charges generated by rubbing are static electric charges. These electric charges remain bound on the surface of the charged object. When a plastic comb is dry hair, it becomes negatively charged. The negatively charged comb induces a positive charge on the pieces of paper which are neutral in nature. As we know that the unlike charges attract each other, plastic comb attracts tiny pieces of paper.

           Question 46.
           <br/>
           What is an electroscope? Draw a labelled diagram of an electroscope and explain its working.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Electroscope is the device which is used to detect charge on a body. It is used for detecting, measuring and finding the nature of a charge. An electroscope consists of a large jar. A metal rod is fitted into the mouth of the jar with the help of the cork. At the lower end of the metal rod a pair of thin leaves of gold or aluminium is suspended. If the leaves of the electroscope diverge or open up when an object is touched, the body is charged. The extent of divergence or opening up of the leaves is a measure of the charge on the body. A body with higher charge will cause greater opening up of the leaves.

           Question 47 A.
           <br/>
           What is lightning? How is lightning produced between clouds in the sky?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The process of electric discharge between clouds and the earth or between different clouds causes lightning. During the development of a thunderstorm, the water droplets move downwards while the air currents move upward. Due to these strong movements, the separation of charges takes place. The positive charges collect near the upper edges of the clouds and the negative charges collect near the lower edges. There is accumulation of positive charges near the ground as well. When the magnitude of the accumulated charges becomes very large, the air which is normally a poor conductor of electricity, is no longer able to resist their flow. Negative and positive charges meet, producing streaks of bright light and sound. We are able to see these streaks as lightening. The process is called an electric discharge.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 47 B.
           <br/>
           Why does lightning usually strike tall buildings?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Lightning strike could destroy life and property. Lightning conductors can protect buildings from the effects of lightning. Lightning strikes the tall buildings and can result in fire.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 47 C.
           <br/>
           What damage can be done when lightning strikes on the earth?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Lightening can result in electric shocks, damage to the buildings and fire. The electric discharge from the clouds can travel through the metal objects and can result into the electric discharge to the person carrying it.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 48 A.
           <br/>
           How does a lightning conductor protect a tall building? Name the scientist who invented the lightning conductor.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Lightening conductor is a device which is used to protect a tall building from lightening. Lightening conductor is made up of metal which is a good conductor of electricity. The lightening conductor is made of metal rod with a sharp pointed edge on the top. They are made of conductive material such as copper and aluminium. A metallic rod which is taller than the building is installed in the walls of the building during its construction. One end of the rod is kept out in the air and the other end is buried deep in the ground. The rod provides easy route for the transfer of electric charge to the ground. Lightening conductor was discovered by Benjamin Franklin.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 48 B.
           <br/>
           Why are lightning strikes more frequent in hilly areas?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Hills are above the sea levels and are nearer to the sky. The clouds are closer to the hills as compared to the grounds. As a result, the lightening can strike much easily and frequently in hilly areas.

           Question 49 A.
           <br/>
           What is an earthquake? What are the two main situations in which earthquakes occur?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Earthquake is the phenomenon in which the earth shakes suddenly for a very short time. It is caused by a disturbance deep inside the earth’s crust. It is the destructive natural phenomenon which cannot be predicted in advance. The earthquakes can cause floods, landslides and tsunamis. Most earthquakes are caused by the movement of earth’s plates. The magnitude (or intensity) of an earthquake is expressed in terms of Richter scale. The destructive earthquakes have magnitudes higher than 7 on the Richter scale. The outermost layer of the earth is fragmented. Each fragment is called a plate. These plates are in continual motion. When they brush past one another, or a plate goes under another due to collision they cause disturbance in the earth’s crust that shows up as an earthquake on the surface of the earth. The tremors on the earth can be caused when a volcano erupts or when a meteor hits the earth. It can also be caused by an underground nuclear explosion.

           Question 50 A.
           <br/>
           Name the three layers of earth. Draw a labelled diagram to show the structure of earth.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Earth consists of four concentric layers: The inner core, outer core, mantle and the crust. The crust is made up of tectonic plates which are in constant motion. Earthquakes and volcanoes are most likely to occur at plate boundaries.
          </p>
<p>
           The Earth is made up of following distinct layers:
          </p>
<p>
           1. The inner core: It is in the center of the Earth. It is the hottest part of the Earth. It is solid and is made up of iron and nickel. It has a temperature of up to 5,500°C.
          </p>
<p>
           2. The outer core: It is the layer surrounding the inner core. It is a liquid layer. It is also made up of iron and nickel. It is still extremely hot, with temperatures similar to the inner core.
          </p>
<p>
           3. The mantle: It is the widest section of the Earth. It has a thickness of approximately 2,900 km. The mantle is made up of semi-molten rock called magma.
          </p>
<p>
           4. The crust: It is the outer layer of the earth. It is a thin layer between 0-60 km thick. The crust is the solid rock layer upon which we live.
          </p>
<p>
           There are two different types of crust: continental crust, which carries land, and oceanic crust, which carries water.

           Question 71.
           <br/>
           Explain why, a charged balloon is repelled by another charged balloon whereas an uncharged balloon is attracted by a charged balloon. (NCERT Book Question)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           There are two types of charges: Positive charge and negative charge. Like charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each other. A charged balloon repels another charged balloon because like charges repel each other. A charged balloon attracts an uncharged balloon by the process of electric induction. The charged balloon produces opposite charges in the nearer end of the uncharged balloon.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 72.
           <br/>
           Explain why, a glass rod can be charged by rubbing when held by hand but an iron rod cannot be charged by rubbing, if held by hand.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The electric charges generated by rubbing are static electric charges. These electric charges remain bound on the surface of the charged object. When a glass rod is rubbed with silk, some of the electrons from the glass atoms are transferred to silk. Due to the deficiency of electrons in the glass atoms, it becomes positively charged. Whereas the silk has acquired electrons, it becomes negatively charged. Iron rod is a conductor. As soon as we charge an iron rod by rubbing with another material, the electric charge flow through our hand and body and flows into the earth. As a result, the iron rod remains un-charged by rubbing, if held by hand.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 73.
           <br/>
           A glass rod is rubbed with a silk cloth and an inflated rubber balloon is rubbed with a woollen cloth. Now, out of glass rod, silk cloth, rubber balloon and woollen cloth:
           <br/>
           (a) which two objects acquire negative charge?
           <br/>
           (b) which two objects acquire positive charge?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Silk cloth and Rubber balloon acquire negative charge. When a glass rod is rubbed with silk, some of the electrons from the glass atoms are transferred to silk. Due to the deficiency of electrons in the glass atoms, it becomes positively charged. Whereas the silk has acquired electrons, it becomes negatively charged. An inflated rubber balloon can be charged by rubbing it against the woolen cloth. Upon rubbing, the wool loses electrons and it causes the electrons to move from the wool to the balloon’s surface. The rubbed part of the balloon now has a negative charge.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) Glass rod and Woolen cloth acquire positive charge. When a glass rod is rubbed with silk, some of the electrons from the glass atoms are transferred to silk. Due to the deficiency of electrons in the glass atoms, it becomes positively charged. An inflated rubber balloon can be charged by rubbing it against the woolen cloth. Upon rubbing, the wool loses electrons and it causes the electrons to move from the wool to the balloon’s surface. The woolen cloth is left with a positive charge.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 74.
           <br/>
           What will you observe when the metal top of an electroscope is touched with:
           <br/>
           (a) a positively charged object?
           <br/>
           (b) a negatively charged object?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) When a glass rod is rubbed with a silk cloth, it acquires positive charge. When it is touched with the metal top of an electroscope, both the metal top and leaves acquires a positive charge due to conduction. As a result of the positive charge on both the leaves, the divergence of leaves takes place.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) After rubbing the plastic comb, it acquires negative charge. When it is touched with the metal cap of an electroscope, both the metal cap and the leaves acquire negative charge due to conduction. As a result of negative charge on both the leaves, divergence of leaves takes place.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 75.
           <br/>
           An earthquake measures 3 on Richter Scale:
           <br/>
           (a) Would it be recorded by a seismograph?
           <br/>
           (b) Is it likely to cause much damage?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Earthquake is the phenomenon in which the earth shakes suddenly for a very short time. It is caused by a disturbance deep inside the earth’s crust. Seismograph is the instrument which is used to measure and record an earthquake. The tremors produce waves on the surface of the earth. These are called seismic waves. These waves are recorded by the seismograph. Yes, An earthquake measuring 3 on Richter scale will be recorded by a seismograph.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) Earthquake is the destructive natural phenomenon which cannot be predicted in advance. The earthquakes can cause floods, landslides and tsunamis. Most earthquakes are caused by the movement of earth’s plates. The magnitude (or intensity) of an earthquake is expressed in terms of Richter scale. The destructive earthquakes have magnitudes higher than 7 on the Richter scale. No, an earthquake which measures 3 on Richter scale is unlikely to cause much damage.
