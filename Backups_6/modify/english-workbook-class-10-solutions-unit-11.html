           A.5.
           <br/>
           Look at the following sentences :
          </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
           (a) He needn’t come to office tomorrow.
           <br/>
           (b) He needed permission to take a day off.
          </p>
<p>
           What is the difference in the use of ‘need’ between the above sentences ?
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            In sentence (a) ‘need’ is used as a modal verb because there is a hare infinitive after it.
           </li>
<li>
            In sentence (b) ‘need’ is used as a main verb because there is a noun after it.
           </li>
<li>
            Can, could, may, might, shall, should, will and would are called ‘pure’ modals because they
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           (a) are followed by a main verb in its bare infinitive form (e.g. I must go.)
           <br/>
           (b) don’t change in the third person (e.g. He will help and not He wills help.)
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Need and dare are used both as modal verbs and main verbs.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           e.g. (1) They needed a lot of money to start a business (main verb).
          </p>
<p>
           (2) They need not borrow from the bank to start their business, (modal)
           <br/>
           (As a modal, verb ‘need’ is commonly used with ‘not’)
          </p>
<p>
           (3) He dare not challenge the authority of his boss, (modal verb)
           <br/>
           (As a modal verb dare is also commonly used with ‘not’)
          </p>
<p>
           (4) He does not dare to challenge the authority of his boss, (main verb)
          </p>
<p>

           ‘Can’ and ‘Could’ also denote ability. Rewrite the following sentences as shown in the example using ‘Can’ or ‘Could’.

           Example: Parents who are able to support their children should not apply for scholarship.

<p>
           C.1.
           <br/>
           Read the following report of a school cricket match and underline all the modals and the verbs accompanying them. Underline the modals red and the verbs green.
          </p>
<p>
           Our school cricket team is practicing really hard for the zonal matches. I have no doubt that we will beat the local teams very easily, but when it comes to the outside teams, I am not as confident. Our boys must work very hard. Perhaps they could do some yoga exercises to improve their concentration. They need not worry about their fitness at this stage, but they should follow a strict routine.
          </p>
<p>
           Last year they had to struggle to reach the finals. The draw might have been a little unfavourable to them but they shouldn’t have neglected their fielding. This landed them in trouble in the quarter finals. This year our team should try and do better in the field. We lost the finals last year mainly because of floored catches ! A casual approach to this aspect must have been the cause of our failure at the crucial stage. So our team ought to improve its fielding and get its batting to click.

           Dear Mohan
          </p>
<p>
           It was lovely to get your letter and to hear the good news that you are going trekking with your friends. You (ought to/ would/ should) have a break after your exams ! You ask me what you (can/ should, will) take. Well, you (might/ can’t/ mustn’t) fit everything in a backpack so you must be selective. You (will/ can/ must) take at least one sweater because it (ought to/ should/ can) get very cold in the mountains. You (needn’t/ could/ should) pack a gas stove because there (could/ may/ will) be plenty of firewood from dead trees.
          </p>
<p>
           I’m sure you will have a wonderful time but I (may/ would/ should) give you a word of warning. Don’t get stuck in the Laki Pass at night. Once you’re there you (won’t be able to/ can’t be able to/ not to able to) get down and it’s very dangerous at night. By the way, you (should/ should have to/ should have) told me earlier that you were going and I (should have/ would have/ will have) given you my walking boots !
          </p>
<p>
           Anyway, look after yourself and enjoy your holiday.
           <br/>
           With love

<strong>
            A night at the Theatre – Role Play
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           Work in pairs. Below is a summary of a discussion between a parent and a child. Read through the notes and decide who will take which role. Then act out the role play. You will probably find that you sometimes need to use modals.
           <br/>
           Background to role play
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            Role A – Daughter/ Son
            <br/>
</strong>
           Yours exams start next week – behind with revision – want to go to theatre to see new play – with friend – his birthday – reduced tickets – good play – need rest from work – find it difficult to concentrate on work.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            Role B – Father/ Mother
           </strong>
<br/>
           Disagree with daughter/ son – worried – won’t do well in exam – don’t want them to waste time – for own good – why not worked hard before – if had worked, could go out after exams.
          </p>
<p>
           E.3.
           <br/>
           When you have finished, you and your partner should team up with another pair and write out the dialogue. Then act it out before the class.
           <br/>
           Answers:
           <br/>
           A : Father, Today is the birthday of my friend Ram. I want to go to theatre to see a new play. It’s a good play and the tickets are available at reduced rates.
           <br/>
           B : I am surprised at you, son. Your exams start next week. Don’t you know you are behind with revision? How can you think of wasting time in a theatre?
           <br/>
           A : You are right. But think about it. Can I go on studying all the time? I need some rest from work and I think it is the proper time to do so.
           <br/>
           B : Going to the theatre is not to relax. It will be a waste not of just 3 hours but the whole day. You will keep on thinking about the characters of the play all day.
           <br/>
           A : Oh no. I believe that I shall be able to concentrate on the books better after that.
           <br/>
           B : You say it because you want to get my permission. Otherwise, you know the truth.
           <br/>
           A : Father, think about my friend. This is his birthday and we had planned for this day much in advance.
           <br/>
           B : Well, you can do what you want. I needn’t keep you against your wish. However, I wish you should have been more careful about your studies.
           <br/>
           A : Thanks father. Be sure that I’ll do well in the examination.
