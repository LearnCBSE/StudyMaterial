<br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 12 Physics Set 6 with Solutions 7" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-155372" height="58" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-12-Physics-Set-6-with-Solutions-7.png" width="171"/>

<p>
           Since soft iron has high relative permeability, so maximum field lines will pass through it when it is placed in a uniform magnetic field. Hence, Fig. (c) correctly shown the given situation.

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           An electromagnetic wave of frequency v = 3.0 MHz passes from vacuum into a dielectric medium with permittivity ε = 4.0F/m, then [1]
           <br/>
           (a) wavelength is doubled and the frequency remains unchanged
           <br/>
           (b) wavelength is halved and frequency becomes half
           <br/>
           (c) wavelength is halved and frequency remains unchanged
           <br/>
           (d) wavelength and frequency both remain unchanged
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (c) wavelength is halved and frequency remains unchanged
          </p>
<p>
           We know that, in vacuum, ε
           <sub>
            0
           </sub>
           = 1
           <br/>
           In medium, ε = 4 F/m
           <br/>
           So. refractive index, n = \(\sqrt{\varepsilon / \varepsilon_0}\) = \(\sqrt{4 / 1}\) = 2
           <br/>
           Wavelength, λ’ = \(\frac{\lambda}{n}\) = \(\frac{\lambda}{2}\)
           <br/>
           and wave velocity, v = \(\frac{c}{n}\) = \(\frac{c}{2}\) (∵ n = \(\frac{c}{v}\))
           <br/>
           Hence, it is clear that wavelength and velocity will become half but frequency remains unchanged when the wave is passing through any medium.
          </p>

           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Which of the following statement is correct property for equipotential §urfaces in uniform electric field? [1]
           <br/>
           (a) Two equipotential surfaces intersect each other at acute angles.
           <br/>
           (b) Electric lines of force are perpendicular to equipotential surface.
           <br/>
           (c) Work done in moving a charge on equipotential surface is always negative.
           <br/>
           (d) Equipotential surface is always spherical in shape.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (b) Electric lines of force are perpendicular to equipotential surface.
          </p>
<p>
           The statement given in option (b) is correct but rest are incorrect and these can be corrected as follows.
           <br/>
           Two equipotential surfaces can never intersect each other. Work done in moving a charge on equipotential surface is always zero because electric field lines are always perpendicular to the surface.
           <br/>
           The shape of equipotential surface depends on the source of electric field. For a point charge, it is spherical in shape. For a line charge, it is cylindrical in shape.

           </sup>
           ion in its ground state, on the basis of Bohr’s model, will be about \(\frac{1}{3}\) times to that of Bohr radius. Therefore, the radius of lithium ion is near \(\frac{53 i}{3}\) ≈ 18 pm.

           Question 7.
           <br/>
           When a 220 V AC is applied to a capacitor C, then [1]
           <br/>
           (a) The phase of voltage and current is same.
           <br/>
           (b) Between the plates of capacitor, maximum voltage is 220 V.
           <br/>
           (c) Average power delivered to the capacitor per cycle is zero.
           <br/>
           (d) Charge on the plate is not in phase with the applied voltage
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (c) Average power delivered to the capacitor per cycle is zero.
          </p>
<p>
           When AC voltage of 220 V is applied to a capacitor C, the charge on the plates is in phase with the applied voltage. As, the circuit is purely capacitive, so the current leads the voltage by an angle of 90°.

           Which of the following is true for rays coming from infinity? [1]
           <br/>
           (a) Two images are formed at two different points
           <br/>
           (b) Continuous image is formed between focal points of upper and lower lens
           <br/>
           (c) One image is formed by the lens
           <br/>
           (d) None of the above
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Two images are formed at two different points
          </p>
<p>
           Since, lens is made of two layers of different refractive indices, for a given wavelength of light, it will have two different focal lengths or will have two images at two different points as \(\frac{1}{f}\) ∝ (μ – 1) (from lens Maker’s formula).

<p>
           As, the current in the wire AB decreases. So, the magnetic flux linked with the coil decreases into the plane of paper. By Lenz’s law, induced current in the coil is such that it increases the linked flux due to the wire. Flence, the direction of current in the coil is clockwise.

           It is obvious that, magnetic field is independent of length and cross-sectional area.
           <br/>
           Also, magnetic field is uniform inside the solenoid. Therefore, A and R are true but R is not the correct explanation of A.

           Explain in brief, why Rutherford’s model cannot account for the stability of an atom? [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Electrons revolving around the nucleus have centripetal acceleration. According to classical electromagnetic theory, an accelerated electron must radiate energy in the form of electromagnetic waves. Due to this continuous loss of energy of electron, the radii of their orbits should be continuously decreasing and ultimately the electron should fall into the nucleus.

           <br/>
           When a straight wire is bent into the form of a circular coil of N turns, then the length of the wire is equal to circumference of the coil multiplied by the number of turns. Let the radius of coil be r.

<br/>
           As, the wire is bent round in the form of a coil having N turns.
           <br/>
           ∴ N × circumference of the coil = Length of the wire
           <br/>
           ⇒ N × (2πr) = L
           <br/>
           ⇒ r = \(\frac{L}{2 \pi N}\) …(i)
           <br/>
           Magnetic field at the centre of coil due to N turns of a coil is given by
           <br/>
           B = \(\frac{\mu_0(N I)}{2 r}\) = \(\frac{\mu_0(N I)}{2\left(\frac{L}{2 \pi N}\right)}\) [from Eq. (i)]
           <br/>
           = \(\frac{\mu_0 \pi N^2 I}{L}\)
           <br/>
           The direction of magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of loop and entering into it.

           Question 28.
           <br/>
           State Lenz’s law. A metallic rod held horizontally along east-west direction is allowed to fall under gravity. Will there be an emf induced at its ends? Justify your answer. [3]
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           A rectangular loop of length l and breadth b is placed at distance of x from infinitely long wire carrying current i such that the direction of current is parallel to breadth. If the loop moves away from the current wire in a direction perpendicular to it with a velocity v, what will be the magnitude of emf in the loop? [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Lenz’s law states that the polarity of induced emf is such that it tends to produce a current which opposes the change in magnetic flux that produced it.
           <br/>
           Yes, emf will be induced in the rod as there is change in magnetic flux.
          </p>
<p>
           Or
          </p>
<p>
           Since loop is moving away from the wire, so the direction of current in the loop will be as shown in the figure.

           Question 29.
           <br/>
           Read the following paragraph and answer the questions that follow
           <br/>
           Mirror formula is a relation between focal length of the mirror and distances of object and image from the mirror. When two rays originating from a point on an object, trace their paths, find their point of intersection and obtain image of the point due to reflection at a spherical mirror.
          </p>
<p>
           (i) Relation between u, v and R, if focal length of the mirror \(\frac{R}{2}\) is
           <br/>
           (a) \(\frac{1}{u}\) + \(\frac{1}{v}\) = \(\frac{1}{R}\)
           <br/>
           (b) \(\frac{1}{u}\) + \(\frac{1}{v}\) = \(\frac{2}{R}\)
           <br/>
           (c) \(\frac{1}{u}\) + \(\frac{1}{v}\) = \(\frac{1}{f}\)
           <br/>
           (d) None of these
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (b) \(\frac{1}{u}\) + \(\frac{1}{v}\) = \(\frac{2}{R}\)
          </p>
<p>
           Given, f = \(\frac{R}{2}\)
           <br/>
           By using mirror formula,
           <br/>
           \(\frac{1}{f}\) = \(\frac{1}{v}\) + \(\frac{1}{u}\)
           <br/>

           <br/>
           ⇒ \(\frac{2}{R}\) = \(\frac{1}{v}\) + \(\frac{1}{u}\)

           (d) – 20 cm
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (d) – 20 cm
          </p>
<p>
           Given, u = -20 cm, f = – 10 cm
           <br/>
           Using mirror formula, \(\frac{1}{v}\) + \(\frac{1}{u}\) = \(\frac{1}{f}\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ \(\frac{1}{v}\) = \(\frac{1}{f}\) – \(\frac{1}{f}\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ \(\frac{1}{v}\) = \(\frac{1}{-10}\) – \(\frac{1}{-20}\) = \(-\frac{1}{20}\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ v = -20 cm

           (b) image distance decreases
           <br/>
           (c) image intensity increases
           <br/>
           (d) image intensity decreases
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (d) image intensity decreases
          </p>
<p>
           If lower half of a concave mirror is blackened, then image will be now only half of the object, but taking the laws of reflection to be true for all points of the remaining part of the mirror, the image will be that of the whole object. However, as the area of the reflecting surface has been reduced, the intensity of the image will be reduced.

           Question 30.
           <br/>
           Read the following paragraph and answer the questions that follows.
           <br/>
           Semiconductor Diode
           <br/>
           A semiconductor diode is basically a p-n junction with metallic contacts provided at the ends for the various application. It is two terminal device. When an external voltage is applied across a semiconductor dipde, such that p-side is connected to th’e positive terminal of the battery and n-side of the negative terminal, it is said to be forward biased. An ideal diode is one whose resistance in forward biasing is zero and the resistance is infinite in reverse biasing. When the biasing voltage is more than the knee voltage, the potential barrier is overcome and the current increases rapidly with increase in forward voltage.
           <br/>
           When the diode is reverse biased, the reverse bias voltage produce a very small current about a few microamperes which almost remains constant with bias. This small current is called reverse saturation current.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           (c) both electrons and holes
          </p>
<p>
           Electric conduction in a semiconductor occurs due to both electrons and holes.

           <br/>
           (c) n-side to the p-side, if the junction is forward biased and in opposite direction if it is reverse biased
           <br/>
           (d) p-side to the n-side if the junction is forward biased and in opposite direction if it is reverse biased
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) n-side to the p-side
          </p>
<p>
           Drift current in p-n junction is from n-side to p-side.

           <br/>
           (a) if the junction is forward biased
           <br/>
           (b) if the junction is reverse biased
           <br/>
           (c) if the junction is unbiased
           <br/>
           (d) in no case
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) if the junction is forward biased
          </p>
<p>
           If the junction is forward biased, diffusion current is greater than drift current in terms of magnitude.
          </p>

           (i) A wavefront is the locus of all points in the field of an optical disturbance having same phase at a given instant.

           For rays of light from different parts on the incident wavefront, the values of AF are different. But light from different points of the incident wavefront should take the same time to reach the corresponding points on the reflected wavefront.
           <br/>
           So, t should not depend upon AF. This is possible only, if
           <br/>
           sin i – sin r = 0
           <br/>
           i.e. sin i = sin r
           <br/>
           or ∠i = ∠r ……(ii)
           <br/>
           which is the first law of reflection.
           <br/>
           Further, the incident wavefront AS, the reflecting surface XY and the reflected wavefront CD are all perpendicular to the plane of the paper.
           <br/>
           Therefore, incident ray, normal to the mirror XY and reflected ray all lie in the plane of the paper. This proves the second law of reflection.

           Question 33.
           <br/>
           (i) If two similar large plates, each of area A having surface charge densities +σ and -σ are separated by a distance d in air, find the expression for
           <br/>
           (a) field at points between the two plates and on outer side of the plates. Specify the direction of the field in each case. [1]
           <br/>
           (b) the potential difference between the plates. [1]
           <br/>
           (c) the capacitance of the capacitor so formed. [1]
           <br/>
           (ii) Two metallic spheres of radii R and 2R are charged, so that both of these have same surface charge density a. If they are connected to each other with a conducting wire, in which direction will the charge flow and why? [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) According to the question,
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 12 Physics Set 6 with Solutions 21" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-155386" height="135" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-12-Physics-Set-6-with-Solutions-21.png" width="205"/>
<br/>
           (a) Electric field due to a plate of positive charge
           <br/>
           at point, P = \(\frac{\sigma}{2 \varepsilon_0}\)
           <br/>
           Electric field due to other plate = \(\frac{\sigma}{2 \varepsilon_0}\)
           <br/>
           Since, they have same direction, so
           <br/>
           E
           <sub>
            net
           </sub>
           = \(\frac{\sigma}{2 \varepsilon_0}\) + \(\frac{\sigma}{2 \varepsilon_0}\) = \(\frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_0}\)
           <br/>
           Outside the plate, electric field will be zero because of opposite direction.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) Potential difference between the plates is given by
           <br/>
           V = Ed = \(\frac{\sigma d}{\varepsilon_0}\) [∵ E = \(\frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_0}\)]

<br/>
           Potential at the surface of radius R,
           <br/>
           V = \(\frac{k q}{R}\)
           <br/>
           = \(\frac{k \sigma 4 \pi R^2}{R}\) = σk 4πR = 4kσπR
           <br/>
           Potential at the surface of radius 2R,
           <br/>
           V’ = \(\frac{k q}{2 R}\) [∵ q = σ × 4π(2R)² = 16σπR²]
           <br/>
           So, V’ = \(\frac{k \sigma 16 \pi R^2}{2 R}\) = 8kσπR.
           <br/>
           Since, the potential of bigger sphere is more. So, charge will flow from sphere of radius 2R to sphere of radius R.

           A cube of side b has a charge q at each of its vertices. Determine the potential and electric field due to this charge array at the centre of the cube. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Consider a cube of side b and its centre be 0. The charge q is placed at each of the corners.
           <br/>
           Side of the cube = b
           <br/>

<br/>
           Length of the main diagonal of the cube
           <br/>
           = \(\sqrt{b^2+b^2+b^2}\) = \(\sqrt{3} b\)
           <br/>
           Distance of centre O from each of the vertices,
           <br/>
           r = \(\)
           <br/>
           Potential at point O due to one charge,
           <br/>
           V = \(\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0}\) ⋅ \(\frac{q}{r}\)
           <br/>
           Potential at point 0 due to all charges placed at the vertices of the cube,
           <br/>
           V’ = 8V = \(\frac{8 \times 1 \times q}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 r}\) = \(\frac{8 q \times 2}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 \cdot b \sqrt{3}}\)
           <br/>
           = \(\frac{4 q}{\sqrt{3} \pi \varepsilon_0 b}\)
           <br/>
           The electric field due to one vertex is balanced by the electric field due to the opposite vertex because all charges are positive in nature. Thus, the resultant electric field at the centre 0 of the cube is zero.
