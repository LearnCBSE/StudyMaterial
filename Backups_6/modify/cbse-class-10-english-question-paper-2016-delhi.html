           Gandhiji As a Fund Raiser
          </p>
<p>
           1. Gandhiji was an incurable and irrestible fund raiser. He found special relish in getting jewellery from women. Ranibala of Burdwan was ten years old. One day she was playing with Gandhiji. He explained to her that her bangles were too heavy for her delicate little wrists. She removed the bangles and gave them away to Gandhiji.
          </p>
<p>
           2. He used to talk jokingly to small girls and created distaste for ornaments and created a desire in them to part with the jewellery for the sake of the poor. He motivated them to donate their jewellery for social usage.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           3. Kasturbai didn’t appreciate this habit of Gandhiji. Once she stated calmly, ‘You don’t wear jewels, it is easy for you to get around the boys. But what about our daughters-in-law ? They would surely want them.
          </p>
<p>
           4. “Well,” Gandhiji put in mildly,” our children are young and when they grow up they will not surely choose wives who are fond of wearing jewellery”, Kasturbai was very upset with the answer.
          </p>
<p>
           5. Gandhiji was determined to keep the jewels to raise community fund. He was of the opinion that a public worker should accept no costly gifts. He believed that he should not own anything costly, whether given or earned. Kasturbai was a female with desire to adorn. But Gandhiji moved towards renunciation and donated every penny earned in South Africa to the trustees for the service of South African Indians.
          </p>
<p>
           1.1 Answer the questions given below: 2 × 4 = 8
          </p>
<p>
           (a) How did Gandhiji create a distaste for jewellery in Ranibala?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Gandhiji created a distaste for jewellery in Ranibala by telling her that her bangles were too heavy for her delicate little wrists.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           (b) What was Kasturbai’s apprehension about their daughters-in-law?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Kasturbai knew that their daughters-in-law would like to have ornaments and they would not appreciate Gandhiji’s attitude towards jewellery.
          </p>
<p>
           (c) What solution did Gandhiji suggest for the problem posed by Kasturbai?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Gandhiji’s suggestion to Kasturbai’s problem was that when their sons grew up they would prefer and choose wives who were not fond of jewellery.
          </p>
<p>
           (d) How did Gandhiji serve the community?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Gandhji served the community by motivating the rich to donate their jewellery for social usage. He worked hard to inspire the people to raise community fund and donated his earnings for the service of South African Indians.

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below:
          </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
           DEPARTMENTAL ORGANISATION IN THE U.S.A.
          </p>
<p>
           1. At the present there are thirteen executive branch departments in the government of U.S.A. The heads of these thirteen departments, each of whom holds the title of ‘Secretary’, collectively form the President’s Cabinet and their department are described as ‘of cabinet rank’. In the American system, the cabinet lacks any constitutional or even statutory base. Cabinet rank is simply a symbolic affirmation of importance within the executive hierarchy.
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Class 10 English Question Paper 2016 (Delhi) with Solutions 1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-167737" height="307" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CBSE-Class-10-English-Question-Paper-2016-Delhi-with-Solutions-1.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CBSE-Class-10-English-Question-Paper-2016-Delhi-with-Solutions-1.png 665w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CBSE-Class-10-English-Question-Paper-2016-Delhi-with-Solutions-1-300x138.png 300w" width="665"/>
</p>
<p>
           2. When the first Congress convened in 1789, its members agreed that several executive departments should be established and that each should be headed by a single official appointed, as the constitution required, by the President with the Senate’s advice and consent. The departments of State, Treasury and War (the latter renamed and reorganised in 1947 as the department of defence) were set up in 1789, as was the office of Attorney General (now the Justice Department). The Post Office Department was also created in 1789, but its present day successor, the U.S. Postal Service, is no longer a department of Cabinet rank.
          </p>
<p>
           3. Only four of the present 13 executive branch departments – State, Treasury, Defence and Justice – can trace their lineage all the way back to Washington’s Presidency. Four others – Interior, Agriculture, Labour and Commerce  – were established in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. The remaining five departments have been established since 1950; Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) in 1953; Housing and Urban Development in 1965; Transportation in 1966; Energy in 1977 and Education in 1979. The last of these came into being when the old office of Education was separated from HEW and given independent depart-mental status. HEW was at the same time renamed and recast as the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Ranked by their expenditures or by their sales, the three largest organisations in the United States are all executive branch agencies; the Department of Health and Human Services, Defence and Treasury.
          </p>

           (i) The Cabinet rank ministers
           <br/>
           (ii) The heads of the executive branch departments
           <br/>

<br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The given graph portrays a worrying situation about the sex ratio of Delhi wherein the number of females per 1,000 males has been on a steady decline. In the year 1991 it was 867 which came down to an all time low of 809 in 2001 stating the concerned state of affairs. Though it has seen a rise there after, still number of females born per 1000 males in not very encouraging. The factors contributing to this situation are illiteracy, female infanticide and female foeticide which cane still prevalent. Due to lack of education and backward thinking people specially from the weaker sections of society prefer a male child over a female child. Through the government has taken up stringent steps to tackle this issue but unfortunately the figure seen in the sex ratio in the past few years are nor all encouraging very firm steps are needed to control this crisis for the balance to be maintained in our society.

           [B] Read the following excerpt from an article that appeared in a local daily. It is felt that electronic media (TV news) will bring about the end of print media (newspapers). Write a paragraph to analyse the given argument. You could think about what alternative explanations might weaken the given conclusion and include rational evidence that would strengthen/counter the given argument. 8
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Electronic media (TV news) has the advantage of fast reporting that makes one wonder if it will bring about the end of print media (newspapers). With TV news becoming a 24-hour news reporting channel, the newspapers were in jeopardy of losing their value. But, on the contrary this 24 hour, news coverage has become rather repetitive and news that is not even important is covered by the news channels. Scandals are allowed to become news and an increase in viewership has become the main objective of TV news channels. Newspapers are time tested medium of news which have become an integral part of our morning routine. Newspapers are far from becoming extinct and cannot be over ruled by the electronic media.

           <br/>
           With the opening of that sack began a phase of my life that has not yet ended, and may, for all I know, not end before I do. It is, in effect, a thraldom to otters, an otter fixation, that I have since found to be shared by most other people, who have ever owned one. The creature that emerged from this sack on to the spacious tiled floor of the Consulate bedroom resembled most of all a very small, medievally-conceived, dragon.

           (a) What ‘phase of life’ began for the writer with the opening of the sack?

           (a) The ‘phase of life’, that began for the writer was a strong attachment or feeling of fixation for otters.
           <br/>
           (b) The creature resembled a middle-age’s dragon. He was totally covered with pointed scales, between which was visible a soft velvet chocolate-brown fur.
           <br/>
           (c) The otter belonged to the race Lutrogale perspicillata maxwelli or Maxwell’s otter.
           <br/>
           (d) The word ‘thraldom’ means ‘being under the control of’.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           From the head to the tip of the tail he was coated with symmetrical pointed scales of mud armour, between whose tips was visible a soft velvet fur like that of a chocolate-brown mole. He shook himself, and I half expected a cloud of dust, but in fact it was not for another month that I managed to remove the last of the mud and see the otter, as it were, in his true colours. Mijbil, as I called the otter, was, in fact, of a race previously unknown to science, and was at length christened by zoologists Lutrogale perspicillata maxwelli, or Maxwell’s otter.

           writing long letters
           <br/>
           in which I scarcely mention the departure
           <br/>
           of the forest from the house.
           <br/>
           The night is fresh, the whole moon shines
           <br/>
           in a sky still open
           <br/>
           the smell of leaves and lichen
           <br/>
           still reaches like a voice into the rooms.
          </p>
<p>

           <br/>
           Answer the following questions in 30-40 words each. 2 × 5 = 10
           <br/>
           (a) Why did the baker and his family always look happy and prosperous?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Baking was a profitable profession in the Goan village and a baker and his family
           <br/>
           always looked happy and prosperous. Even his servants were always satisfied. Since bread and cakes were an integral part of Goan life, the baker’s business was so flourishing and they always looked happy and prosperous.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) What legends are associated with the origin of tea?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           There is a legend about the Chinese emperor who always boiled water before drinking it. One day a few leaves of the twigs burning under the pot fell into the water, giving it a delicious flavour. It is said those were tea leaves. According to the Indian legend, Bodhidharma, a Buddhist ascetic, cut off his eyelids because he felt sleepy during meditation. Ten tea plants grew out of the eyelids. The leaves of these plants when put in hot water and drunk banished sleep.

           (c) With what request does Lomov come to Chubukov? What is his state of mind at that time?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Lomov comes to Chubukov’s house to ask for his daughter, Natalya’s hand in marriage. He is doubtful of winning the hand of Natalya. Moreover he has not yet made up his mind to marry or not. So, he is feeling cold and is trembling. The fear that if he gives himself time to hesitate, talk a lot, look for an ideal, or real love, then he will never get married, haunts him.

<p>
           (d) What was Ebright’s achievement in his senior year?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In his senior year Ebright went a step further in his experiments on the monarch
           <br/>
           pupa. He grew cells from a monarch’s wing in a culture and showed that the cells would divide and develop into normal butterfly wing scales only if they were fed the hormone from the gold spots. This project also won for him the first place for Zoology at the International Fair, after which he continued to do further work at the army lab.

<p>
           (e) What impression do you form of Ausable as a secret agent after reading the story “The Midnight Visitor”?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Though Ausable’s appearance did not match that of a secret agent and he did not really fit the description of one, he was indeed a very intelligent and smart agent. Fowler too could not imagine that a secret agent would be so very fat like Ausable and would house himself in a dingy small room but even he could not deny the fact that in a difficult situation Ausable had a great presence of mind and was very alert. Ausable was shrewd enough to understand Fowler’s disillusionment on seeing him and told him to take cheer because he would show him an important document that would change his framework of mind.

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Answer the following question in about 100-150 words. 8
           <br/>
           “The life of mortals in this world is troubled and brief and combined with pain With this statement of the Buddha, find out the moral value that Kisa Gotami learnt after the death of her child.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           After the death of her son, Kisa Gotami realised that death is common to all. There is no way by which those who have been bom can avoid dying. All creatures have to fall into the power of death. The world is suffering with death and decay, therefore the wise do not grieve, knowing the terms of the world. No one will obtain peace of mind from crying or being sad. On the contrary his pain will be greater and his body will suffer. He, who is able to overcome his sorrow and become composed will obtain peace of mind and be blessed.

           A simple moment proves to be very significant and saves the rest of the day of the poet from being wasted. Explain on the basis of the poem ‘Dust of Snow’.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The poet Robert Frost in his poem ‘Dust of Snow’ tells us there is always an opportunity and hope to change sadness into happiness. Simple moment like falling snow changed the poet’s sad mood into a happy one and saved the day from being wasted. Nothing is good or bad. It is our way of looking at things, sitting under a hemlock tree the poet’s mood is just like the tree, very sad. The dust of snow falls on the poet as a crow shakes the branch. Life is full of problems, we should try7 to solve them rather than just sit and regret. Sometimes unimportant things change the meaning of life. The crow and hemlock teach a lesson of how to change the negative feelings that engulf you and look at the positive side in order to make our life better.

           Question 11.
           <br/>
           Answer the following question in about 100 – 120 words. 8
           <br/>
           “Don’t you worry, Pitaji! In your old age I will serve you and mother”. Through this statement the narrator wants to highlight the moral values Bholi was imbued with. Based on the reading of the lesson, what made Bholi aware of her rights and how did she use them?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Bholi’s teacher made her aware of her rights. Her teacher’s encouragement and affection gave her a new life. Her teacher removed fear from her heart and made her speak like anyone else. The shy and humble girl’s personality underwent a complete change towards the end of the story. She gained self-confidence and with strong determination she faced her prospective bridegroom with cold contempt in her eyes. She openly rejected the proposal of the greedy man. She preferred to stay unmarried and serve her parents in their old age than lose her self-respect and integrity. Her teacher was instrumental in infusing into her a sense of confidence due to which she was able to take a bold decision.
           <br/>

           The course of the Loisels’ life changed due to the necklace. Comment.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Loisels’ life changed drastically after the loss of the necklace. They possessed only eighteen thousand francs of their own. They borrowed the rest of the money to pay a total amount of thirty six thousand francs for a new necklace. Matilda’s husband made ruinous promises, took money from insurers and the whole race of lenders. Later, to pay their frightful debt, they played their part completely and heroically. They sent away the maid, they changed their lodgings and rented some rooms in an attic Matilda learnt the ordinary work of the kitchen. She washed the dishes, the soiled linen and clothes. Her husband worked evenings, putting the books of some merchants in order. At night he often did copying and this kind of miserable life lasted for ten years before they had repaid all the money.
