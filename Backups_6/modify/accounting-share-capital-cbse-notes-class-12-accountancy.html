<strong>
            11. Re-issue of Shares
           </strong>
<br/>
           The directors can either cancel or re-issue the forfeited shares. Shares forfeited can be re-issued at par, at premium or at a discount
           <br/>
           In case, they are re-issued at par, accounting entry will be
           <br/>
           Bank A/c Dr
           <br/>
           To Share Capital A/c
           <br/>
           In case, shares are re-issued at a discount, the amount of discount allowed on the re-issue of forfeited shares must not exceed the amount forfeited on re-issued shares. The discount allowed on re-issue of forfeited shares should be debited to the ‘share forfeiture account’. The journal entry will be
           <br/>
           Bank A/c Dr [With the amount received on re-issue]
           <br/>
           *Share Forfeiture A/c Dr [With the discount allowed on re-issue]
           <br/>
           To Share Capital A/c [With the amount credited as paid-up]
           <br/>
           *It is calculated as
           <br/>
           Number of Shares Re-issued x (Paid-up Value – Re-issue Price Per Share)
           <br/>
           If the forfeited shares are re-issued at a price higher than that paid-up, the excess is credited to securities premium reserve account. The journal entry will be
           <br/>
           Bank A/c Dr
           <br/>
           To Share Capital A/c To Securities Premium Reserve A/c
           <br/>
           Transfer of Balance in Forfeited Share Account Forfeited Shares A/c Dr
           <br/>
           To Capital Reserve A/c (Being balance of share forfeiture account transferred to capital reserve account)
