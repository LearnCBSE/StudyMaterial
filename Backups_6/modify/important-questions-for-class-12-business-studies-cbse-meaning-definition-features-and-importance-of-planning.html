            reason in support of your answer.(Delhi 2012)
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           Yes, planning ensures that goals or objectives are clearly stated so that they act as a guide for deciding what action should be taken and in which direction.

<strong>
            3. Why is it said that’planning is pre-requisite for controlling’?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            (Delhi 2009c)
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           Under the system of controlling, actual work performance is compared with standards. Hence, if the standards are not determined, there is no justification left for control. Therefore, planning is pre-requisite for controlling.
          </p>

<strong>
             3 Marks Questions
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<strong>
            8. Explain the following as features of planning
           </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
             Planning is continuous
            </strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
             Planning is futuristic. (Delhi 2013)
            </strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
            Ans. (i) Planning is continuous
           </strong>
           Plans are prepared for a specific period of time, may be for a month, a quarter or a year. At the end of that period, there is need for a new plan to be drawn on the basis of new requirements and future conditions. Management can’t afford to follow rigid plans in the era of fast changes in technology, market, etc. Thus, a manager must develop or modify the plans from time to time as per the need. Hence, planning is a continuous process.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (ii) Planning is futuristic
           </strong>
           Planning is essentially looking ahead and preparing for the future. It is based on the proverb, ‘look before you leap’. In other words, it is carried out to achieve some objectives in future. It, therefore, becomes essential to anticipate or predict the future.
           <br/>
           For example, A manufacturer prepares next year’s production plan after forecasting the demand. Therefore, it is said that planning is futuristic and involves thinking before doing.

<strong>
            9. Explain the following features of planning
           </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
             Planning involves decision-making; and
            </strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
             Planning is pervasive.   (Delhi 2013)
            </strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
<strong>
            (i) Planning involves decision-making
           </strong>
           The need of planning arises because of the availability of various alternatives to achieve specified objectives. It considers or evaluates the best alternative. Decision-making is an integral part of planning. A manager is surrounded by number of alternatives. He has to pick the best depending upon requirements and resources of the enterprises.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (ii) Planning is pervasive
           </strong>
           Planning is required at all levels of management as well as in all departments of the organisation. It is not only for top management but it differs at different levels and among different departments. The top level may be more concerned about planning for the organisation as a whole whereas, the middle level may be more specific in departmental plans and the lower level is concerned for the implementation of the same.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            10. State any three advantages of planning. (Delhi 2012)
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           Advantages of planning are as follows:
           <br/>
<strong>
            (i) Planning provides direction
           </strong>
           By stating in advance how work is to be done, planning provides direction for action. It reduces aimless activity and makes action more meaningful.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (ii) Planning reduces the risk of uncertainty
           </strong>
           Planning is always done for future and future is uncertain. With the help of planning, possible changes in future are anticipated and various activities are planned in the best possible way.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (iii) Planning facilitates decision-making
           </strong>
           Planning is an intellectual activity. It helps the manager to look into the future and make a choice from amongst various alternative courses of action. The manager has to evaluate each alternative and select the most viable option. Thus, decision-making is inherent in planning.

           Planning is the process of thinking before doing. It is the process of determining a course of action to achieve the desired results. Planning bridges the gap between ‘where we are’ and ‘where we want to go’.
           <br/>
           Two features of planning are as follows:
           <br/>
           (i) Planning is a goal-oriented function of management.
           <br/>
           (ii) Planning is a continuous process.

            13. Explain how planning is’futuristic’? (Delhi 2008)
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
<strong>
            Planning is futuristic
           </strong>
           Planning is essentially looking ahead and preparing for the future. It is based on the proverb, ‘look before you leap’. In other words, it is carried out to achieve some objectives in future. It, therefore, becomes essential to anticipate or predict the future.
           <br/>
           For example, A manufacturer prepares next year’s production plan after forecasting the demand. Therefore, it is said that planning is futuristic and involves thinking before doing.

<strong>
            14. Explain how planning reduces the risk of uncertainty?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            (All India 2008)
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           Planning reduces the risk of uncertainty because
           <br/>
           (i) It enables a manager to look ahead and anticipate changes.
           <br/>
           (ii) It shows the way to deal with changes and uncertain events.
           <br/>
           (iii) Changes or events can not be eliminated, as they can only be anticipated and managerial responses to them can be developed.

<strong>
            15. Explain how planning is a ‘mental exercise’? (Delhi 2008)
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           Planning is a ‘mental exercise’ because
           <br/>
           (i) It requires application of the mind involving foresight, intelligent imagination and sound judgement.
           <br/>
           (ii) It is basically an intellectual activity of thinking rather than doing because planning determines the actions to be taken.
           <br/>
           (iii) It requires logical and systematic thinking rather than guesswork or intuitional thinking. In other words, thinking for planning must be orderly, based on the analysis of facts and forecasts.

<strong>
            16. Explain how planning facilitates decision-making? (All India 2008)
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           Planning facilitates decision-making because
           <br/>
           (i) Decision-making involves choice among various alternatives and activities. Planning provides the framework to make the best choice.
           <br/>
           (ii) Planning lays down the criterion for evaluating alternative courses of action and selecting the most appropriate alternative.
           <br/>
           (iii) Planning involves setting targets and predicting future conditions and thereby making rational decisions.
           <br/>
           (iv) It is planning that provides the guidelines for decision-making, by listing the goals of an organisation.

<strong>
            17. Explain how planning is a ‘continuous process’?   (All India 2008)
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans. Planning is continuous
           </strong>
           Plans are prepared for a specific period of time, may be for a month, a quarter or a year. At the end of that period, there is need for a new plan to be drawn on the basis of new requirements and future conditions. Management can’t afford to follow rigid plans in the era of fast changes in technology, market, etc. Thus, a manager must develop or modify the plans from time to time as per the need. Hence, planning is a continuous process.

<strong>
            Ans. (i) Planning is continuous
           </strong>
           Plans are prepared for a specific period of time, may be for a month, a quarter or a year. At the end of that period, there is need for a new plan to be drawn on the basis of new requirements and future conditions.

<strong>
            (iii) Planning involves decision-making
           </strong>
           The need of planning arises because of the availability of various alternatives to achieve specified objectives. It considers or evaluates the best alternative. Decision-making is an integral part of planning. A manager is surrounded by number of alternatives. He has to pick the best depending upon requirements and resources of the enterprises.

<strong>
            (iv) Planning is pervasive
           </strong>
           Planning is required at all levels of management as well as in all departments of the organisation. It is not only for top management but it differs at different levels and among different departments. The top level may be more concerned about planning for the organisation as a whole whereas, the middle level may be more specific in departmental plans and the lower level is concerned for the implementation of the same.
