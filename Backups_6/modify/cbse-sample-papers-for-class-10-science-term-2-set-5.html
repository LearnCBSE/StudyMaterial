<br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           For identification of elements that belong to the same group, we need to write the electronic configuration of these elements.
          </p>
<table border="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">
              Elements
             </td>
<td style="text-align: center;">

<tr>
<td>
              P
             </td>
<td>
              2,3
             </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
              Q

              2,7
             </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
              R
             </td>
<td>
              2, 8,7
             </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
           As is evident from the above table, elements Q and R have 7 valence electrons each. The group is determined with the help of valence electrons. Thus, they belong to the same group, group number 17.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           Related Theory:
           <br/>
           For neutral atoms, the number of valence electrons is equal to the atom’s main group number. The main group number for an element can be found from its column on the periodic table. The number of valence electrons of an element can be determined by the periodic table group (vertical column) in which the element is categorized. With the exception of groups 3-12 (the transition metals), the unit digit of the group number identifies how many valence electrons are associated with a neutral atom of an element listed under that particular column.
          </p>
<p>
           Caution
           <br/>
           For identification of the elements, assess the group according to the valence electrons. Same number of valence electrons corresponds to the same chemical properties, and hence, same group.
          </p>
<p>
           (B) The eLements P, Q and R belong to groups 1, 14 and 17 respectiveLy of the Periodic Table. Which two elements will form Ionic compounds? Predict the formula of the compound. (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           For identifying which element will form ionic compounds, we need to compute the electronic configuration of these elements as shown below:
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<table border="2">

             </td>

             </td>
<td style="text-align: center;">
              Valency
             </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
              P
             </td>
<td>
              2,3
             </td>
<td>
              1
             </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
              Q
             </td>
<td>
              2,7
             </td>
<td>
              4
             </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
              R
             </td>
<td>
              2,8,7
             </td>

              1
             </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
           It is evident from the above table that the valency of the elements P, Q and R are 1, 4 and 1 respectively. Ionic compounds are formed by transfer of electrons whereas covalent compounds are formed by sharing of electrons. Element P and R can easily lose or gain electrons to attain stability whereas element Q cannot lose or gain 4 electrons to attain stability.
          </p>
<p>
           Thus, elements P and R can form ionic compounds. The formula of the compounds will be as follows:
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 10 Science Term 2 Set 5 with Solutions 2" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-132922" height="98" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-Science-Term-2-Set-5-with-Solutions-2.png" width="146"/>
<br/>
           Related Theory
           <br/>
           An ionic bond is formed by the complete transfer of some electrons from one atom to another. The atom losing one or more electrons becomes a cation-a positively charged ion. The atom gaining one or more electron becomes an anion-a negatively charged ion.
          </p>
<p>
           Caution
           <br/>
           Students need to identify the valencies of the elements correctly. Once that is done, students need to criss-cross the valencies to form the compound. Usually the mistake will be done when the valencies of the elements are different.
          </p>

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           A magnetic compass needle is placed in the plane of paper near point Q as shown in figure. In which plane should a straight current carrying conductor be pLaced so that it passes through Q and there is no change in the deflection of the compass? Under what condition is the deflection maximum and why?
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 10 Science Term 2 Set 5 with Solutions 3" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-132921" height="126" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-Science-Term-2-Set-5-with-Solutions-3.png" width="169"/>
<br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When the magnetic field and direction of electric current are in the same plane, there would be deflection in the compass. For maximum deflection, magnetic field and direction of current should be in mutually perpendicular plane. So, for no deflection, conductors should be kept parallel to the magnetic compass. For maximum deflection, it should be placed perpendicular to the compass.
          </p>

           <br/>
           There is equation F = Bil sin θ (Not in syllabus) where F depends on i, l, B and angle θ.
           <br/>
           For max F, sin θ = 1 when θ = 90°→ Perpendicular For min F, sin θ when θ = 0° → Parallel.

<p>
           Caution
           <br/>
           Though the given equation is not a part of your syllabus yet having a knowledge of it can help you in your understanding of many variable dynamics and relations.

           Question 3.
           <br/>
           (A) Rom reads a statement in a textbook which said “Genes controL characteristics or traits. Elaborate and justify this statement? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Tallness of a plant is a characteristic. Height of a plant depends on the amount of hormone secreted by the plant responsible for its tallness. The gene has the coding for the amount of hormone released. If the gene for that hormone has an alteration and makes its efficiency low, then the plant will be short. Thus, this shows that traits are controlled by gene.
          </p>
<p>
           (B) Traits acquired during the Lifetime (for example — Languages) of an individual not inherited. Justify this statement. (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The traits can be inherited from one generation to the other only if there is a variation/change in DNA. The traits acquired during the lifetime of an individual may not bring change in the genes of DNA.
          </p>

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Leaf captures the sun’s energy and uses it to make organic compounds through photosynthesis but, only 1% of the energy is converted into glucose during photosynthesis. When these leaves are eaten by caterpillar most of the energy 90% is lost as heat. Only 10% of energy reaches to the next level of the consumers.

           Question 6.
           <br/>
           How is the equal genetic contribution of male and female parents ensured in the progeny.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           “It is a possible that a trait is inherited but may not be express (iv)” Give a suitable example to justify this statement. (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In human beings, equal genetic contribution of male and female parents is ensured in the progeny through inheritance of equal number of chromosomes from both parents. There are 23 pairs of chromosomes. All human chromosomes are not paired. Out of these 23 pairs, the first 22 pairs are known as autosomes and the remaining 1 pair is known as sex chromosomes represented as X and Y. FemaLes have a perfect pair of two X sex chromosomes and mates have a mismatched pair of one X and one Y sex chromosome.
          </p>
<p>
           During the course of reproduction, as fertilization process takes place, the male gamete (haploid) fuses with the female gamete (hapLoid) resulting in formation of the diploid zygote. The zygote in the progeny receives an equal contribution of genetic material from the parents. Out of 23 pairs of chromosomes in progeny, male parent contributes 22 autosomes and one X or Y chromosome while female parent contributes 22 autosomes and one X chromosome.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           It is possible that a trait is inherited but may not be expressed. This can be seen in the Mendel experiment. When pure tall pea plants are crossed with pure dwarf pea plants, only tall pea plants are obtained in Fi generation. On crossing tall plants of F

           Question 7.
           <br/>
           (A) Why are most carbon compounds poor conductors of electricity? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Carbon has 4 valence electrons which has the ability to form 4 covalent bonds. Thus, it is able to form a stable octet and thus there is no extra electron present in carbon compounds to conduct electricity. Due to lack of free electrons, they are not able to conduct electricity.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           A saturated compound consists of single covalent bond. According to the question, a cyclic saturated compound consists of a ring like structure consisting of single covalent bonds. One such example is cyclohexane.

           Question 12.
           <br/>
           (A) Why does a current carrying conductor, experience a force when it is placed in a magnetic field? (1½)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When a current-carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field, the wire experiences a force due to the interaction between the external magnetic field and the magnetic field produced by the moving charges in the wire. The current carrying conductor generates it own magnetic field around it. This interacts with the external magnetic field. When two magnetic fields interact there will be attraction and repulsion between them based on the direction of the external magnetic field and the direction of the current in the conductor. That is why the conductor experiences a force.

           (B) A circuit has a line of 5 A. How may lamps of rating 40 W, 220 V can simultaneously glow on this line safely? (1½)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           We know that,
           <br/>
           I = \(\frac{P}{V}=\frac{40 \mathrm{~W}}{200 \mathrm{~V}}\)
           <br/>
           = \(\frac{2}{11}\)
           <br/>
           = 0.182 A
          </p>
<p>
           0.182 A or \(\frac{2}{11}\) A is required by one lamp.
           <br/>
           Current rating i.e.
           <br/>
           maximum current = 5 A
           <br/>
           No. of lamps
           <br/>
           = \(\frac{\text { Current rating }}{\text { Current throughone lamp }}=\frac{5}{0.18}\)
           <br/>
           = 27 lamps
          </p>

           Question 13.
           <br/>
           (A) Identify the part of the seed that helps in storing food during the germination process. (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Cotyledon
           <br/>
           During germination, the cotyledon stores food. The food is needed to release energy in order to foster the growth of the plant. The seeds could be of monocot or dicot type based on the number of cotyledons they have.
          </p>

           (B) Hydra and Planaria reproduce through a similar mode. In what way do you think the reproduction pattern in Hydra is different from Planaria? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Hydra reproduces by budding. In Hydra, a bud develops as an outgrowth due to repeated cell division at one specific site. These buds develop into tiny individuals and when fully mature, detach from the parent body and become new independent individuals.
          </p>
<p>
           Planaria reproduces by regeneration. PLanaria can be cut into any number of pieces and each piece grows into a complete organism. Hence it is different from budding process.
          </p>
<p>
           (C) Leishmania and Plasmodium both reproduce through fission process. Do you see any variation in the pattern of reproduction? If yes, how? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Plasmodium, divides into many daughter cells simultaneously by multiple fission. While in Leishmania, the organism divides into two halves longitudinally.

           (i) ‘i’ (metallic character decreases from left to right in a period).
           <br/>
           (ii) ‘f'(or ‘n’)
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           (i) Metals are called electropositive elements since their atoms form positive ions by losing electrons.
           <br/>
           (ii) Potassium, K and Cesium, Cs are the metals that would show chemical reactions similar to sodium. This is because they have the same number of electrons in the outermost shell.

           Question 15.
           <br/>
           Consider a situation. A bar magnet, North pole pointing downwards is falling from a certain height, as shown.
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 10 Science Term 2 Set 5 with Solutions 12" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-132912" height="227" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-Science-Term-2-Set-5-with-Solutions-12.png" width="168"/>

           (A) Describe the vertical motion of the magnet as it approaches the solenoid and passes through it. (2)
           <br/>
           (B) A magnetic compass shows a deflection when placed near a current carrying wire. How will the deflection of the compass get affected if the current in the wire is increased? Support your answer with a reason. (2)
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           How does the magnetic field produced by a solenoid differ from that of a bar magnet? (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (A) Initially when the magnet is far from the solenoid it will fall freely and accelerate downwards at a rate of 9.81 m/s
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
           .
           <br/>
           As it approaches the solenoid its rapidly changing magnetic flux through the solenoid will induce a current in the solenoid.
          </p>
<p>
           Owing to law of electromagnetic induction the current in the solenoid will generate a magnetic field which will oppose the magnetic field due to the bar magnet, as shown.
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 10 Science Term 2 Set 5 with Solutions 13" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-132911" height="235" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-Science-Term-2-Set-5-with-Solutions-13.png" width="177"/>
<br/>
           This repulsive force will slow down the magnet. As the magnet passes through the coll this repulsion will increase which will further slow down the falling magnet. Hence on emerging out of the coil the induced current in the coil will again Oppose the movement of the magnet and will further slow it down.
          </p>
<p>
           So the magnet will fall to the ground at a much slower speed than what it would have fallen had the coil not been there.
          </p>
<p>
           (B) A magnetic compass is made of magnetised iron that points to the earth’s pole. When another magnet is brought close enough, the compass will point in the direction of the second magnet since its magnetic strength is greater than that of the earth.
          </p>
<p>
           When a current carrying wire is introduced close to a magnetic compass, the magnetic compass will deflect due to the production of a magnetic field. A wire carrying electric current will have a magnetic field that forms concentric rings around it. One of the magnet’s ends will attract, while the other will repel, depending on its orientation. Because the electric field is exactly proportional to the magnetic field intensity, the deflection will rise as the current is increased. We can say that the magnetic field is stronger when the electric field is strong.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           A solenoid is a coil of numerous circular turns of wire wrapped in the shape of a cylinder. A solenoid’s magnetic field lines, through which current passes, are extremely similar to those of a bar magnet. The coil’s one end acts as a magnetic north pole, while the other works as a magnetic south pole. A long solenoid produces a magnetic field that is identical to that produced by a bar magnet.
