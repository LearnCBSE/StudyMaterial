           Advantages of manures are:
           <br/>
           (i) Manures are natural fertilizers.
           <br/>
           (ii) Manures are bulky sources of organic matter which supply nutrients in small quantity and organic matter in large quantities.

           </span>
<br/>
           Limitations of using manures are:
           <br/>
           (i) Manures are not nutrient specific.
           <br/>
           (ii) Manures are not able to fulfill the high and rapid demand of nutrients required by improved high-yielding hybrid varieties of crops.
           <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
            Solution 08;
           </span>
<br/>
           Manure contains many organic substances of biological origin which can be easily degraded and absorbed by plants. It helps in recycling of biological waste. Manures increase the fertility of soil for long duration without causing any harm. However, the chemical fertilizers (e.g. urea) improve soil fertility for short duration but cause environmental hazard. Continuous use of fertilizers in a particular area / crop field causes destruction of soil fertility.
           <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
            Solution 09:
           </span>
<br/>
           Advantages of fertilizer over manure:
           <br/>
           (i) Fertilizers are very rich in plant nutrient whereas manure contains small amounts of essential plant nutrients.
           <br/>
           (ii) Fertilizers are soluble in water whereas manure is not soluble in water.

           As a result of this, the pond water would acquire a high concentration of nitrates and phosphates which would result in the excessive growth of algae and phytoplankton in the pond.
           <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
            Solution 11:
           </span>
<br/>
           Eutrophication is a process whereby water bodies, such as lakes or slow-moving streams receive excess nutrients that stimulate excessive plant growth (algae, phytoplankton’s and nuisance plants weeds). This enhanced plant growth is also termed as an algal bloom.
           <br/>
           Example: During rains the nutrients from the fields are washed away and get accumulated in nearby water bodies.
           <br/>

            Solution 12:

           The continuous use of chemical fertilizers in a particular area or crop field leads to loss of soil fertility.

<br/>
           There are three methods of fertilizer applications in practice:
           <br/>
           (i) Broadcasting: Uniform distribution over the whole cropped field.
           <br/>
           (ii) Placement: Application in bands or in pockets near the plants or plant rows.
           <br/>
           (iii) Foliar application: Using low or high volume sprayers, the fertilizers are sprayed covering the plants.

           Compost Manure
           <br/>
           It is prepared from farm and town refuge such as vegetable and animal refuse.

<br/>
           Manure – Manures are natural fertilizers. They are bulky sources of organic matter which supply nutrients in small quantities, and organic matter in large quantities. There are different types of manures: Farmyard manure (FYM), Compost, Green manures and Vermicompost.
           <br/>
           Manures affect the soil in following three ways:
           <br/>
           (i) Manures enrich the soil with nutrients. They replenish the general deficiency of nutrients in the soil. Since manure contains fewer nutrients they need to be used in large quantities.
           <br/>
           (ii) Manures add organic matter (called humus) to the soil which restores the soil texture, for better retention of water and aeration of soil.
           <br/>
           (iii) The organic matter in manures provides food for the soil organisms, (decomposers such as bacteria, fungi, etc. which help in providing nutrients to plants.

           Green manuring is the practice which includes growing, mulching by ploughing and mixing of green crops with soil, to improve physical structure and soil fertility.
           <br/>
           Example – Sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea).

           Fertilizers – Fertilizers are one of the major components for obtaining higher yields especially in expensive farming practices. Fertilizers are divided into following four groups:
           <br/>
           (i) Nitrogenous fertilizers – These fertilizers supply the macronutrient nitrogen.
           <br/>
           Example – Urea, CO(NH2)2
           <br/>
           (ii) Potassic fertilizers – These fertilizers supply potassium which is one of the essential macronutrient of the plants.
           <br/>
           Example – Potassium sulphate, K2SO4.
           <br/>
           (iii) Complex fertilizers – These fertilizers contains two or more nutrients.
           <br/>
           Example – Nitrophosphate

           Biofertilisers – Organisms which enrich the soil with nutrients are called biofertilisers. Biofertilisers are used for the specific crop plants such as pulses, legumes, oil seeds and rice. They are renewable and non-pollutant sources of plant nutrient such as nitrogen.
           <br/>
           Nitrogen fixing microorganisms, i.e., non-symbiotic and symbiotic cyanobacteria and phosphate-solubilising microorganism are the main type of biofertilisers.

           Field crops are infested with a variety of pests. There are various methods by which insects and diseases can be controlled. One of the most common and effective methods is the use of pesticides or biocides which include insecticides (for killing the insects), weedicides (for killing the weeds) and fungicides (for killing the fungi). Thus chemicals used to kill the pests, e.g. weeds; insects, mites, rodents and fungi are called pesticides. These chemicals are sprayed on crop plants or used for treating seeds and soil.

           Irrigation is the process of supplying water to crop plants by means of canals, wells, reservoirs, tube-wells, etc.
           <br/>
           Irrigation is necessary in the areas where there is scarcity and irregular distribution of rain that can cause drought. It provides sufficient moisture for the germination of seeds, as seeds do not germinate in dry soil. It is also necessary for the growth and development of crop plants. The irrigation water tends to dissolve the nutrients present in the soil and forms a Solution which is easily absorbed by the roots of the plants.
           <br/>
           Excessive irrigation causes water logging and increases surface salinity. In water logged soil, plants do not get proper aeration.

           The various types of irrigation systems are –
           <br/>
           (i) Canal system: In this system, the human-made canals receive water from one or two reservoirs or from rivers. The main canal is distributed into branch canals which have further distributaries or field channels.
           <br/>
           (ii) Tanks: These are small storage reservoirs which catch and store the runoff of smaller catchment areas.
           <br/>
           (iii) Wells: These are of two types – dug wells and tube wells. In dug wells, water is collected from water bearing strata. The water from the shallow strata slowly accumulates in the pit and water is lifted by mechanical means. A tube well can tap water from the deeper strata.
           <br/>
           (iv) River lift system: It is more useful in the areas where canal flow is insufficient or irregular due to inadequate water release. In this system, water is directly drawn from the rivers for supplement irrigation.
           <br/>
           (v) River valley system: Certain parts of the country such as Karnataka and Kerala which lie along the Western Ghats use water that is discharged into the steep and narrow riverine valleys, during the rainy season. The bottom flat lands of the valleys are used for growing crops.
           <br/>
           (vi) Drip and sprinkler system: It employs the overhead pipes for spraying water.
           <br/>
           Efficiency of applied water can be increased by rain water harvesting and water shed management.

           Honey bee lives in a colony and different tasks are done by different groups of bees in the same colony. According to their roles, there are three types of castes in the colony of bee:
           <br/>
           (i) Queen – The body size of queen is much larger than other castes of bees of the colony. Queen is responsible for laying eggs and lays upto 200 eggs everyday of each season.
           <br/>
           (ii) Drone – It is haploid, fertile male. These are larger in size than workers. They are stingless and their main role is to mate with queen and remain in colony to sleep and eat honey.
           <br/>
           (iii) Worker – Worker is diploid, sterile female. Its size is smallest among the caste of bees. They are the active members of the colony. For various outdoor and indoor chores, the workers are provided with a variety of organs such as hypopharyngeal glands (for secretion of bee milk), wax glands (for building cells of comb), pollen baskets on their hind legs (for collection of pollen), sucking type mouth parts (for collecting the nectar), high level secretion of invertase enzyme (in the honey sac for honey formation), a sting at the tip of the abdomen (for defence of the colony.
           <br/>
           Honey bees provide a good example of team work and division of labour.

           The worker bees of a hive fall under 3 groups. These are:
           <br/>
           (i) Scavenger Bees – For the first three days each worker bees act as a scavenger.
           <br/>
           (ii) Nurse Bees – From the fourth day onwards each worker bee feeds the entire brood, like a foster mother, with a mixture of honey and pollen. By seventh day, its starts producing royal jelly, which is fed to the queen and future queen bees. They also perform guard duties.
           <br/>
           (iii) Foraging or Field bees – They explore new sources of nectar. They collect nectar, pollen and propolis. Nectar is changed into honey in the crops.
