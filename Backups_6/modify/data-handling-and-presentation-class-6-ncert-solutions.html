           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Is the above table sufficient to distribute each type of sweet to the correct student? Explain. If it is not sufficient, what is the alternative?
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           No, it is not sufficient.
           <br/>
           Shri Nilesh should have also written children’s names against each sweet item. Only then he could have given the right sweet to the right child.

<li>
            There are ____________ students who wear shoe sizes larger than 4.
           </li>

<p>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Here let’s make the frequency table.
           <br/>
<img alt="Data Handling and Presentation Class 6 NCERT Solutions Ganita Prakash Maths Chapter 4 8" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-177236" height="273" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Data-Handling-and-Presentation-Class-6-NCERT-Solutions-Ganita-Prakash-Maths-Chapter-4-8.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Data-Handling-and-Presentation-Class-6-NCERT-Solutions-Ganita-Prakash-Maths-Chapter-4-8.png 330w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Data-Handling-and-Presentation-Class-6-NCERT-Solutions-Ganita-Prakash-Maths-Chapter-4-8-300x248.png 300w" width="330"/>

<ul>
<li>
            The largest shoe size in the class is
            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
             7
            </span>
            .
           </li>

            The smallest shoe size in the class is
            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">

<li>
            There are
            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
             15

            students who wear shoe sizes larger than 4.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           How did arranging the data in ascending order help to answer these questions?
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Let’s arrange the data in ascending order:
           <br/>
           3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7
           <br/>
           It takes a bit more time to answer as compared to the frequency table.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Are there other ways to arrange the data?
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Yes. The data can also be arranged in descending order.

<br/>
           (a) Three symbols

           (d) Yes.
           <br/>
           Kites purchased by Rani = 300
           <br/>
           Kites purchased by Poonam Ben = 700

           Question 1.
           <br/>
           How many total cars passed through the crossing between 6 am and noon?
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Total cars passed = 600 + 700 + 800 + 1000 + 1200 + 150 = 4450 cars

<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Why do you think so little traffic occurred during the hours of 6-7 am, as compared to the other hours from 7 am to noon?
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           The traffic that occurs during the hours 6-7 am is very little, as it is early morning time and there are very few office goers. Also, there are very few.

</p>
<p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Why do you think the traffic was the heaviest between 7 am and 8 am?
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           7-8 am is the hour when the maximum number of factory officers and workers use their cars and parents use their cars to drop their children at school.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Why do you think the traffic was lesser and lesser each hour after 8 am until noon?
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Because, most of the schools start at 8 am – and many factories also start at 8 am and hence less traffic between 8 am-9 am. Most offices start at 9 am and shops start at 10 am and hence less traffic between 9 am-10 am.

<br/>
           (a) The total number of saplings planted on Wednesday and Thursday is ____________
           <br/>
           (b) The total number of saplings planted during the whole week is ____________
           <br/>
           (c) The greatest number of saplings were planted on ____________, and the least number of saplings were planted on ____________.
           <br/>
           Why do you think that is the case? Why were more saplings planted on certain days of the week and less on others? Can you think of possible explanations or reasons? How could you try and figure out whether your explanations are correct?
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           (a) 30 + 40 = 70 saplings
           <br/>
           (b) 52 + 40 + 30 + 40 + 50 + 60 + 40 = 312 saplings
           <br/>
           (c) Saturday, Wednesday.

           Question 11.
           <br/>
           The number of tigers in India went down drastically between 1900 and 1970. Project Tiger was launched in 1973 to track and protect tigers in India. Starting in 2006, the exact number of tigers in India was tracked. Shagufta and Divya looked up information about the number of tigers in India between 2006 and 2022 in 4-year intervals. They prepared a frequency table for this data and a bar graph to present this data, but there are a few mistakes in the graph. Can you find those mistakes and fix them?

<br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Yes, there are a few mistakes in the graph.
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            No. of tigers in 2006 was 1400 but shown less in the graph.
           </li>
<li>
            No. of tigers in 2014 was 2200 but shown more in the graph.
           </li>

           Question 1.
           <br/>
           If you wanted to visually represent the data of the heights of the tallest persons in each class in your school, would you use a graph with vertical bars or horizontal bars? Why?
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Graph with vertical bars. Vertical graphs are like pillars and show a much better presentation of the person’s height.

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           If you were making a table of the longest rivers on each continent and their lengths, would you prefer to use a bar graph with vertical bars or horizontal bars? Why? Try finding out this information, and then make the corresponding table and bar graph! Which continents have the, longest rivers?
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Graph with horizontal bars, because rivers flow on land horizontally.
