           Question 3.
           <br/>
           How it can be proved that the basic structure of the Modem Periodic Table is based on the electronic configuration of atoms of different elements?
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           The electronic configuration of an element is 2, 8, 4. State its:
           <br/>
           (a) group and period in the Modern Periodic Table.
           <br/>
           (b) name and write its one physical property. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Modern periodic law states that the physical and chemical properties of an element are the periodic function of the atomic number of that element.
           <br/>
           Electronic configuration of the elements play an important role in the placement of elements in the modem periodic table. The valence shell electron of an element decides its position in a particular group or period for example: if the configuration of an element is 2, 1 it means that the
           <br/>
           Li = 2, 1
           <br/>
           It belongs to the 2nd period and 1st group.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           (b) Si = 2, 8, 4
           <br/>
           1. It means that it belongs to 3rd period and 14th group.
           <br/>
           2. The name of element is Silicon.
           <br/>
           It is a metalloid, (i.e. element that has properties of both metals and non-metals).
          </p>
<p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Write two different ways in which glucose is oxidized to provide energy in the human body. Write the products formed in each case. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:

           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Define the term power of accommodation. Write the modification in the curvature of the eye lens which enables us to see the nearby objects clearly? [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length is called the power of accommodation. There should be a contraction . of ciliary muscles, that will increase the curvature of the eye lens and becomes thicker, so the focal length of the eye lens will decrease. It will thus enable us to see the objects clearly.

           Question 7.
           <br/>
           Identify the acid and the base from which sodium chloride is obtained. Which type of salt is it? When is it called rock salt? How is rock salt formed? [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           NaCl is made by reacting an acid and a base. The base is NaOH (Sodium hydroxide). So,
           <br/>
           HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           O
           <br/>
           It is a Neutralization Reaction.
           <br/>
           It is known as rock salt in crystalline form.
           <br/>
           It is the result of the evaporation of ancient oceans millions of years ago. Sometimes pressure from deep inside the Earth forces up large masses of rocks to form salt-like domes.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 8.
           <br/>
           Based on the group valency of elements write the molecular formula of the following compounds giving justification for each:
           <br/>
           (i) Oxide of first group elements.
           <br/>
           (ii) Halide of the elements of group thirteen, and
           <br/>
           (iii) Compound formed when an element, A of group 2 combines with an element, B of group seventeen. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>

           (b) What is contraception? List three advantages of adopting contraceptive measures. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther of the stamen to the stigma of the pistil with the help of air, water and insects.
           <br/>
           Types of pollination:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Self-pollination: Transfer of pollen grain from the anther to the stigma of the same flower.
           </li>
<li>
            Cross-pollination: Transfer of pollen grain from the anther of one flower to the stigma of other flowers of the same species.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Two agents of pollination are air, water, insects etc.
           <br/>
           When correct species of pollen grain lands on the stigma it results in some chemical response from the ovary that causes the growth of pollen tube from pollen grain. The pollen grain slides down the pollen tube and enters the ovary where it meets the egg. This process is called as fertilization and leads to the formation of zygote.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           The parts of the female Reproductive system are as follows:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Fallopian tube or Oviduct
           </li>
<li>
            Ovary
           </li>
<li>
            Uterus
           </li>

           </li>
<li>
            Vagina
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Contraception is the method by which a female inhibits fertilization and hence presents pregnancy.
           <br/>
           The three advantages of contraception are:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            It makes people more aware of the concept of family planning.
           </li>
<li>
            It educates the people about Sexually Transmitted Diseases and ways to avoid it.
           </li>
<li>
            It helps the female to space children.

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           What is the feedback mechanism of Harmonic regulation? Take the example of insulin to explain this phenomenon. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Hormones control many cell activities, so they are very important for homeostasis most hormones are regulated by feedback mechanisms. A feedback mechanism is a loop in which a product feeds back to control its own production. Most hormone feedback mechanism involves negative feedback loops. Negative feedback keeps the concentration of a hormone within a narrow range.
           <br/>
           For example,
           <br/>
           The control of blood sugar by insulin is an example of a negative feedback mechanism. When blood sugar rises, receptors in a body sense a change. In turn the control center secretes insulin into the blood effectively lowering the blood sugar level.

           <br/>
           What happens to the image distance in the normal human eye when we decrease the distance of an object, say 10 m to 1 m? Justify your answer. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The image distance will remain unaffected even if we change the object distance because the image is formed on the retina.
          </p>

</p>
<p>
           Question 7.
           <br/>
           List three advantages each of:
           <br/>
           (i) exploiting resources with short term aims, and
           <br/>
           (ii) using a long term perspective in managing our natural resources. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) 1. Short term exploitation will meet the demand of the present generation.
           <br/>
           2. There will be no shortage of resources.
           <br/>
           3. Larger aspect regarding the details of a reserve can be studied also.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) 1. Long term management of natural resources would meet the demand of present and future generation.
           <br/>
           2. No harmful impact on the environment.
           <br/>
           3. Equitable distribution of resources amongst the rich and poor.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Nervous and hormonal systems together perform the function of control and coordination in human beings, Justify this statement with the help of an example. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The nervous system controls and coordinates all the functions in the body. It carries out its function in close coordination with hormonal system. Nerves don’t reach every hook and comer of body, hence needs assistance from hormones to control all the parts of body. Nervous control is faster.
           <br/>
           Hormonal control is slower. Hormonal control is based on feedback mechansim and tells body to pace up or slow down. Nervous control is on other hand a direct control. So we can say that both system work in harmony.

           Question 11.
           <br/>
           What is photosynthesis? Explain its mechanism. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The green plants are called autotrophes. They make their own food by the process of photosynthesis. In this process the plants capture the sun rays by the pigment present in the leave called as chlorophyll. Then in the presence of carbondioxide and water they make food for the plants in the form of glucose. In this process oxygen gas is also evolved.
           <br/>
           Equation for the mechanism:

           Question 15.
           <br/>
           Explain the following: [3]
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Sodium chloride is an ionic compound which does not conduct electricity in solid state where as it does conduct electricity in molten state as well as in aqueous solution.
           </li>
<li>
            Reactivity of aluminium decrease if it is dipped in nitric acid.
           </li>
<li>
            Metals like calcium and magnesium are never found in their free state in nature.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Answer:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Sodium chloride is an ionic compound but it conducts electricity only in molten and aqueous state because in molten and aqueous form the compound liberate to give ions. These ions move freely and hence conduct electricity.
           </li>
<li>
            Reactivity of aluminium decreases if it is dipped in nitric acid because it is a strong oxidising reagent. The layer of aluminium oxide prevents further reaction of aluminium due to which its reactivity decreases.
           </li>
<li>
            Metals like calcium and magnesium are never found in their free states in nature because these metals are present on the top of the reactivity series. They are so reactive that they react with gases and surrounding elements, form compounds and thus are not found in free state.
           </li>
</ol>

           Question 17.
           <br/>
           (a) Draw magnetic field lines produced around a current-carrying straight conductor passing through cardboard. Name, state and apply the rule to mark the direction of these field lines.
           <br/>
           (b) How will the strength of the magnetic field change when the point where the magnetic field is to be determined is moved away from the straight wire carrying constant current? Justify your answer. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The right-Hand Thumb rule is used to mark the direction of magnetic field lines produced around a straight current carrying conductor.
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 10 Science 2019 Delhi Set III Q17" height="315" loading="lazy" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48377904041_3cf1d498d2_o.png" width="391"/>
<br/>
           The Right-Hand Thumb rule indicates the direction of the magnetic field for a known direction of current. When the thumb is in downwards direction then the direction in ‘ which fingers are wrapped is clockwise. So magnetic field is clockwise.
           <br/>
           (b) To determine the magnetic field, compass needle is used. On moving away from the compass needle from the straight wire, the deflection of the compass needle decreases showing the decrease in the strength of magnetic field. It happens because the strength of magnetic field produced by a straight wire at any point, is inversely proportional to the distance of wire from the point.
