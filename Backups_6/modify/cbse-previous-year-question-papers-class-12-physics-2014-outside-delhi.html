           Question 6.
           <br/>
           Why is it found experimentally difficult to detect neutrinos in nuclear Î²-decay ? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           Neutrinos are difficult to detect experimentally in Î²-decay because these are uncharged particles with almost zero mass and also they interact weakly with matter.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 7.
           <br/>
           Why is the use of A.C. voltage preferred over D.C. voltage ? Give two reasons. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           The use of A.C. voltage is preferred over the use of D.C. voltage because of the following reasons:
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<ol>
<li>
            The energy losses while transmission of A.C. voltage are very less as compared to D.C. voltage.
           </li>
<li>
            A.C. voltage can be controlled as required by using a transformer (i.e., stepped up or stepped down).
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Question 8.
           <br/>
           A biconvex lens made of a transparent material of refractive index 1.25 is immersed in water of refractive index 1.33. Will the lens behave as a converging or a diverging lens ? Give reason.[l]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           In this case the biconvex lens will behave as a diverging lens because the refractive index of water (1.33) is more than that of the material (1.25) of the lens.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Using Rutherford model of the atom, derive the expression for the total energy of the electron in hydrogen atom. What is the significance of total negative energy possessed by the electron ? [2]
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Using Bohrâ€™s postulates of the atomic model, derive the expression for radius of n

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In a hydrogen atom, an electron having charge -e revolves around the nucleus having charge +e in a circular orbit of radius r.

           Question 12.
           <br/>
           A cell of emf â€˜Eâ€™ and internal resistance â€˜râ€™ is connected across a variable resistor â€˜Râ€™. Plot a graph showing variation of terminal voltage â€˜Vâ€™ of the cell versus the current I. Using the plot, show how the emf of the cell and its internal resistance can be determined. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           The terminal voltage â€˜Vâ€™ of the cell is given by
           <br/>
           V = E â€“ Ir
           <br/>
           where E is the emf of the cell,
           <br/>
           r is the internal resistance of the cell and,
           <br/>
           I is the current through the circuit.
           <br/>
           Comparing with the equation of a straight line y = mx + c, we get
           <br/>
           y = V; x = I m = -r ; c = E
           <br/>
           Graph showing variation of terminal voltage â€˜Vâ€™ of the cell versus the current â€˜Iâ€™.

           Question 13.
           <br/>
           Explain, with the help of a circuit diagram, the working of a p-n junction diode as a half-wave rectifier. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           The circuit diagram for a p-n junction diode as a half wave rectifier is shown below :
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 Physics 2014 Outside Delhi 11" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-127424" height="146" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 334px) 100vw, 334px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Physics-2014-Outside-Delhi-11.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Physics-2014-Outside-Delhi-11.png 334w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Physics-2014-Outside-Delhi-11-300x131.png 300w" width="334"/>
<br/>
           Working : During the positive half cycle of the input a.c., the p-n junction is forward biased i.e., the forward current flows from p to n. In the forward biasing, the diode provides a very low resistance and allows the current to flow. Thus, we get output across load.
           <br/>
           During the negative half cycle of the input a.c., the p-n junction is reversed biased. In the reverse biasing, the diode provides a high resistance and hence a very small amount of current will flow through the diode which is of negligible amount. Thus no output is obtained across the load. During the next half cycle, output is again obtained as the junction diode gets forward biased. Thus, a half wave rectifier gives discontinuous and pulsating d.c. output across the load resistance.
           <br/>
           The waveform of input and output is shown below:

           Ray â€˜1â€² and â€˜2â€™ will fall on the side AC at an angle of incidence (i) of 45Â°. Critical angle of ray â€˜1â€™ is greater than i, so it will get refracted from the prism. Critical angle of ray â€˜2â€™ is less than that of i, so it will undergo total internal reflection.

           Question 17.

           Show diagrammatically the behavior of magnetic field lines in the presence of
           <br/>
           (i) para magnetic and
           <br/>
           (ii) diamagnetic substances. How does one explain this distinguishing feature ? [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) The behavior of magnetic field lines in the presence of a para magnetic substance is shown below:
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 Physics 2014 Outside Delhi 16" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-127429" height="141" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Physics-2014-Outside-Delhi-16.png" width="222"/>
<br/>
           (ii) The behavior of magnetic field lines in the presence of a diamagnetic substance is shown below:
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 Physics 2014 Outside Delhi 17" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-127430" height="172" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Physics-2014-Outside-Delhi-17.png" width="263"/>
<br/>
           This distinguishing feature is because of the difference in their relative permeability. The relative permeability of diamagnetic substance is less than 1, so the magnetic lines of force do not prefer passing through the substance whereas the relative permeability of a paramagnetic substance is greater than 1, so the magnetic lines of force prefer passing through the substance.

            3
           </sub>
           . [3]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           (a) Suppose that an ordinary light is incident normally on a pair of crystals C
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           and C
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           . When the incident ray of light passes through crystal C
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           it gets plane polarised in the direction perpendicular to the length of crystal. Now, we see that when the axis of two crystals are parallel, the intensity of the emerging light will be maximum. When the second crystal is placed perpendicular with respect to the first crystal, the intensity of light observed is zero. This is due to the electric field of the plane polarised light obtained from C
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           can vibrate only in one direction. Hence, when the axis of the crystal C
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           is perpendicular to its direction of vibration of electric field, it gets blocked. This shows the transverse nature of light.

<br/>
           Answer: (a) The connection between the resistors in a meter bridge is made of thick copper strips because the resistivity of a copper wire is very low. As, the connections are thick, so the area becomes large and the resistance of the wires becomes almost negligible.
           <br/>
           (b) It is preferred to obtain the balance point in the middle of the meter bridge wire because it improves the sensitivity of the meter bridge.
           <br/>
           (c) Constantan is used for meter bridge wire because its temperature coefficient of resistance is almost negligible due to which the resistance of the wire does not get affected on increasing temperature of the wire due to flow of current.

<br/>
           Resolving power of a microscope, \(R=\frac{2 \mu \sin \theta}{\lambda}\)
          </p>
<p>
           This formula shows that to enhance resolution, we have to use shorter wavelength and media with large indices of refraction.
           <br/>
           For an electron microscope, Î¼ is equal to 1 (vacuum). For an electron microscope, the electrons are accelerated through a 60,000 V potential difference.
           <br/>
           Thus, the wavelength of electrons is given by,
           <br/>
           \(\lambda=\frac{12.27}{\sqrt{\mathrm{V}}}=\frac{12.27}{\sqrt{60000}}=0.05 \mathrm{A}\)
          </p>
<p>
           As, Î» is very little (roughly 10
           <sup>
            -5
           </sup>
           times smaller) for electron microscope than an optical microscope which uses yellow light of wavelength (5700 A to 5900 A). So, the resolving power of electron microscope is about 10
           <sup>
            5
           </sup>
           greater than that of optical microscope.

           Answer :
           <br/>
           Van de Graaff generator is a device used for building up high potential differences of the order of a few million volts.
          </p>
<p>
           Principle : The working of Van de Graaff generator is based on the following two electrostatic phenomena.
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Discharging action at sharp points (corona discharge) i.e., electric discharge takes place in air or gases readily at the pointed ends of conductors.
           </li>
<li>
            If a charged conductor is brought into internal contact with a hollow conductor, all of its charge transfers to the hollow conductor, howsoever high the potential of the latter may be.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Construction : It has a big spherical conducting shell (S) kept over insulating pillars. A long narrow insulating belt is wound around two pulleys P
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           and P
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           . B
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           and B
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           are two metal combs with sharp points. B
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           is known as spray comb and B
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           collecting comb.
          </p>
<p>
           Working : The spray comb provides positive potential by high tension source. The positive charge is sprayed on belt.
          </p>
<p>
           As belt moves and touches the sphere, a negative charge is induced on the sharp ends of collecting comb B
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           and similar positive charge is induced on the further end of B
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           . This positive charge moves immediately to the outer surface of S, because of discharging action of sharp points of B
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           , the positive charge on the belt is neutralized. The uncharged belt moves downwards and collects the positive charge from B
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           , which is then collected by B
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           . This process is repeated and the positive charge on S goes on accumulating. In this way, voltage differences of as much as 6 or 8 million volts (with respect to the ground) can be created.
          </p>
<p>
           Use : Van de Graaff generator is used to create high potential differences that are used to accelerate charged particles such as electrons, protons, ions, etc., used for nuclear reactions.
          </p>
<p>
           Limitations:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            It is a series of combination that allows only one way for moving charge.
           </li>
<li>
            It can accelerate only the charged particles and not the uncharged particles.
           </li>
</ul>

           (a) Describe briefly how a diffraction pattern is obtained on a screen due to a single narrow slit illuminated by a monochromatic source of light. Hence obtain the conditions for the angular width of secondary maxima and secondary minima.
           <br/>
           (b) Two wavelengths of sodium light of 590 nm and 596 nm are used in turn to study the diffraction taking place at a single slit of aperture 2 x 10

           m. The distance between the slit and the screen is 1.5 m. Calculate the separation between the positions of first maxima of the diffraction pattern obtained in the two cases.
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           (a) In Youngâ€™s double slit experiment, the wave fronts from the two illuminated slits supere mpose on the screen. This results in formation of alternate bright and dark fringes because of constructive and destructive interference, respectively. The intensity of light is maximum at the center C of the screen and it is called central maxima.

           Central Maximum : Each point on the plane wave front AB sends secondary wavelets in all directions. The waves from points equidistant from the center C kept on the upper and lower half reach point O with zero path difference and so, reinforce each other, making maximum intensity at point O.

           Therefore, the frequency of the revolution of the charged particle is independent of the velocity or the energy of the particle.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) The working principle of a cyclotron is that a charge particle can be accelerated to high energy by an oscillating electric field.
          </p>
<p>
           A cyclotron uses an electric field to accelerate charge particles across the gap between the two D-shaped magnetic field regions. The magnetic field is perpendicular to the paths of the charged particles that makes them follow in circular paths within the two D

            s
           </sub>
           . Each time the charged particles cross the D
           <sub>
            s
           </sub>
           , it is accelerated by an alternating voltage. As its speed increases the radius of path of each particle also increases. So, the accelerated particles move in a spiral path to the other wall of the cyclotron.

<br/>
           Principle : The working is based upon the principle, when a current carrying coil suspended in a magnetic field experiences a torque.
          </p>
<p>
           Construction : It consists of a coil with a large number of turns of insulated copper wire wounded on a metallic frame. The coil is suspended by means of a phosphor bronze strip and a horse shoe magnetâ€™s NS surrounds it. The lower end of the coil is attached with a hair spring. The scale of the pointer is attached to the other end of the spring.
          </p>
<p>
           Working : When current is passed, the couple acts on it. Since the plane remains parallel to the magnetic field in all position of the coil, the force on the vertical arms always remains perpendicular to the place of the coil.
           <br/>
           Let I = the current flowing through coil,
           <br/>
           B = magnetic field supposed to be uniformed and always parallel to the coil, and
           <br/>
           A = area of the coil.
           <br/>
           Deflection acting on the coil is
           <br/>
           T = NIBA sin 90Â° â€“ NIBA [ âˆµ sin 90Â° = 1]
           <br/>
           Due to the deflection torque, the coil rotates and suspended wire gets twisted. The suspension fiber experiences a restoring torque. If Î¦ is angle through the coil rotates and k is the restoring torque per unit angular twist, then
           <br/>
           Restoring torque, T = kÎ¦
           <br/>
           In equilibrium, Deflection torque = Restoring torque
           <br/>

<br/>
           This provides a linear scale for the galvanometer,
           <br/>
           (b) (i) When a soft iron core is used the magnetic field lines tend to crowd through the core. It is because, soft iron core is ferromagnetic in nature. As a result, the strength of the magnetic field due to the field magnet increases, which in turn increases the sensitivity of the galvanometer.
           <br/>
           (ii) Current sensitivity of a galvanometer is defined as the deflection produced in the galvanometer when a unit current flows through it.
           <br/>
           \(\mathrm{I}_{s}=\frac{\theta}{\mathrm{I}}=\frac{n \mathrm{BA}}{\mathrm{K}}\) â€¦â€¦.. (i)
          </p>
<p>
           Voltage sensitivity of a galvanometer is defined as the deflection produced in the galvanometer when a unit voltage is applied across two terminals.
           <br/>
           \(\mathrm{V}_{s}=\frac{\theta}{\mathrm{V}}=\frac{\theta}{\mathrm{IR}}=\frac{n \mathrm{BA}}{\mathrm{KR}}=\frac{\mathrm{I}_{s}}{\mathrm{R}} \quad \ldots(\mathrm{ii})\)
          </p>
<p>
           Where n = number of turns in the coil of galvanometer
           <br/>
           B = Magnetic field around coil
           <br/>
           A = Area of coil
           <br/>
           K = restoring torque per unit twist
          </p>
<p>
           From equation (i) we can say that- current sensitivity increases by increasing n, B, A and decreases by decreasing K.
           <br/>
           From equation (ii) we can say that voltage sensitivity increases by increasing n, B, A and decreases by decreasing K, R.
           <br/>
           In case of current sensitivity if we increases the no. of turns n its current sensitivity â€˜ increases. Since resistance of galvanometer R also increases, voltage sensitivity remains same or unchanged. Therefore increase in current sensitivity of galvanometer may not necessarily increase the voltage

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Why do the electrostatic field lines not form closed loops ? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           The electrostatic field lines originate from positive charge and end at the negative charge. As the isolated positive and negative charge do exist, the electrostatic field lines do not form closed loops.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 3.

           A biconvex lens made of a transparent material of refractive index 1.5 is immersed in water of refractive index 1.33. Will the lens behave as a converging or a diverging lens ? Give reason. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The refractive index of material of lens (1.5) is greater than the refractive index of water (1.33). So, it will behave as a converging lens.

<br/>
           the plane of the figure. The double arrows show polarisation in the plane of the figure. Under the influence of the electric field of the incident wave the electrons in the molecules acquire components of motion in both these directions. We have drawn an observer looking at 90Â° to the direction of the sun. Clearly, charges accelerating parallel to the double arrows do not radiate energy towards this observer since their acceleration has no transverse component. The radiation scattered by the molecule is therefore represented by dots. It is polarised perpendicular to the plane of the figure. This explains the polarisation of scattered light from the sky.

           b) As given in the question, the polaroids Pi and P2 are placed with their pass axes perpendicular to each other. Also, P

           is placed at an angle of 45Â° . with respect to P

           Intensity of light after falling on P

           \(\mathrm{I}=\mathrm{I} \cos ^{2} \theta=\frac{\mathrm{I}_{0}}{2} \cos ^{2} 45^{\circ}=\frac{\mathrm{I}_{0}}{4}\)

           Therefore, a light of intensity I
           <sub>
            0

           /4 will pass through P

           </sub>
           will be 45Â° because of the condition given in the question.
           <br/>
           Intensity of light after falling on P

           Energy stored in an inductor : When a current grows through an inductor, a back e.m.f. is set up which opposes the growth of current. So work needs to be done against back e.m.f. (e) in building up the current. This work done is stored as magnetic potential energy.
           <br/>
           Let I be the current through the inductor L at any instant t. The current rises at the rate dl/dt.

           Question 9.
           <br/>
           A convex lens of focal length 20 cm is placed co axially with a concave mirror of focal length 10 cm at a distance of 50 cm apart from each other. A beam of light coming parallel to the principal axis is incident on the convex lens. Find the position of the final image formed by this combination. Draw the ray diagram showing the formation of the image. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The beam incident on lens L is parallel to principal axis. Hence the lens forms an image I

<br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           Metal A has higher threshold frequency because from the graph it is clear that the minimum frequency required to start photo emission is more in A than that of B.

           Question 7.
           <br/>
           (a) A rod of length â€˜lâ€™ is moved horizontally with a uniform velocity V in a direction perpendicular to its length through a region in which a uniform magnetic field is acting vertically downward. Derive the expression for the emf induced across the ends of the rod.
           <br/>
           (b) How does one understand this motional emf by involving the Lorentz force acting on the free charge carriers of the conductor ? Explain. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           (a) Consider a rod PQ of length l moving in a magnetic field \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{B}}\) with a constant velocity \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{v}}\). The length of the rod is perpendicular to the magnetic field and also the velocity is perpendicular to both the rod and field. The free electrons of the rod also move at this velocity \overrightarrow{\mathrm{v}} because of which it experiences a magnetic force.
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 Physics 2014 Outside Delhi 78" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-127491" height="165" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Physics-2014-Outside-Delhi-78.png" width="179"/>
<br/>
           This force is towards Q to P.
           <br/>
           Thus, the free electrons will move towards P and positive charge will appears at Q. An electrostatic field E is developed within the wire from Q to P. This field exerts a force.

<br/>
           the magnetic force on the moving free electron and hence, produces an emf, e = Bvl
           <br/>
           (b) Lorentz force acting on a charge q which is moving with a speed v in a (normal) uniform magnetic field B, is Bqv.
           <br/>
           All the charges will experience the same force. Work done to move the charge from P to Q,

           Answer :
           <br/>
           (a) On reflection from a transparent medium a normal light beam becomes partially polarised. As the angle of incidence gets higher, the degree of polarization gets higher.

<br/>
           The reflected light beam becomes fully polarised at a certain angle. This angle of incidence is known as polarizing angle (p).
           <br/>
           At the interface of a refracting medium when light is incident at polarizing angle, the refractive index of the medium is similar to the tangent of the polarizing angle.
           <br/>
           Âµ = tan p
           <br/>
           where
           <br/>
           Âµ â†’ Refractive index of the refracting medium
           <br/>
           p â†’ Polarising angle
           <br/>
           (b) As given, the polaroid P
