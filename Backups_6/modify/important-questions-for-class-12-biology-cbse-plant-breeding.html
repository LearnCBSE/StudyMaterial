<p>
<strong>
            1.Plant breeding
           </strong>
           is a technique of manipulation of plant species, in order to create
           <br/>
           desired plant types that are better suited for cultivation, give better yields and are
           <br/>
           disease resistant.
          </p>
<p>
           2. The traits or characters that the breeders have tried to incorporate into crop plants are:
           <br/>
           (i) Increased tolerance to environmental stresses, such as salinity, extreme temperatures, drought, etc.
           <br/>
           (ii) Resistant to pathogens like viruses, fungi and bacteria.
           <br/>
           (iii) Increased tolerance to insect pests.
           <br/>
           (iv) High-yield and improved   quality of crop    plants.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            3.Plant breeding programmes
           </strong>
           are carried out  in government institutions and commercial companies.
           <br/>
           The major steps in breeding a new genetic variety of crops are:
           <br/>
<strong>
            (i) Collection of Variability
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            (a) Genetic variabilit
           </strong>
           y is the root of any breeding programme.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (b) Pre-existing genetic variability
           </strong>
           available from wild varieties, species and relatives of crop species is collected and preserved.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (c) Evaluation
           </strong>
           of their characteristics is a pre-requisite for the effective exploitation of natural genes available in the populations.
           <br/>
           (d) The entire collection of plants/seeds having all the diverse alleles for all genes in a given crop is called
           <strong>
            germplasm collection.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            (ii) Evaluation and Selection of Parents
           </strong>
<br/>
           (a) It is carried out by evaluating germplasm, to identify plants with desirable combination of characters.
           <br/>
           (b)The selected plants are multiplied and hybridised.
           <br/>
           (c) By self-pollination, purelines are created whenever desired.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (iii) Cross Hybridisation among Selected Parents
           </strong>
<br/>
           (a) Cross hybridisation is carried out to combine desired genetic characters from two ‘ different plants (parents).
           <br/>
           (b) Cross hybridisation is a time consuming and tedious process, as it involves collection of pollen grains from the desired plants and other pollination techniques to incorporate desired traits.
           <br/>
           (c) It is not certain that the hybrids would combine desired characters. The chances of
           <br/>
           desirable combination is usually only one in few hundred to a thousand crosses carried out
           <br/>
<strong>
            (iv) Selection and Testing of Superior Recombinants
           </strong>
<br/>
           (a) This step consists of selection of plants among the progeny of the hybrids withdesired combination of characters.
           <br/>
           (b) It yields plants that are superior than both the parents. This is known as
           <br/>
<strong>
            hybrid vigour/heterosis.
           </strong>
<br/>
           (c) They are self-pollinated for several generations, till they reach a state of uniformity or homozygosity, so that the characters will not segregate in the progeny.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (v) Testing, Release and Commercialisation of New Cultivars
           </strong>
<br/>
           (a)
           <strong>
            Evaluation
           </strong>
           is done for newly selected lines for their yield and other agronomic traits of quality, disease resistance, etc.
           <br/>
           (b) Selected plants are grown in research fields and their performance is recorded under ideal fertiliser application, irrigation and other crop management practices.
           <br/>
           (c)
           <strong>
            Testing
           </strong>
           of hybrid line is done in farmer’s field after evaluation. After testing, the crop is grown at different locations in the country with different agroclimatic zones for atleast three growing seasons.
           <br/>
           (c) The tested material is evaluated in comparison to the best available local crop cultivar used as reference cultivar.
           <br/>
           (d)
           <strong>
            Release
           </strong>
           of tested material is finally done in bulk after selection and certification.

            4. Green Revolution
           </strong>
<br/>
           (i)It is the movement that led to the development of several high yielding varieties of wheat and rice in the mid 1960s.
           <br/>
           (ii)
           <strong>
            Green revolution
           </strong>
           was dependent mainly on plant breeding techniques for the development of high-yielding and disease-resistant varieties in wheat, rice, maize, etc.
           <br/>
           (iii) It led to dramatic increase in food production in our country.
           <br/>
           (iv) In India, agriculture accounts for approximately 33% of India’s GDP and employs nearly 62% of population.
           <br/>
           (v)
           <strong>
            Wheat and rice
           </strong>
           During 1960-2000, the production of wheat increased from 11 million tonnes to 75 million tonnes, while the production of rice increased from 35 million tonnes to 89.5 million tonnes.
           <br/>
           (a)This increased production was due to the introduction of semi-dwarf varieties of wheat and rice.
           <br/>
           (b) Nobel Laureate Norman E Borlaug, developed semi-dwarf varieties of wheat, at the International Centre for Wheat and Maize Improvement in Mexico.
           <br/>
           (c) Semi-dwarf varieties of rice were developed from IR-8 at The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI, Philippines) and Taichung Native-1 (in Taiwan).
           <br/>
           (d) High-yielding and disease-resistant wheat varieties were introduced in India in 1963, e.g. Sonalika and Kalyan Sona.
           <br/>
           (e) The semi-dwarf varieties were introduced in India in 1966.
           <br/>
           (f) Better-yielding semi-dwarf varieties, i.e. Jaya and Ratna were developed in India.
           <br/>
           (vii)
           <strong>
            Sugarcane
           </strong>
           Saccharum barberi of North India and Saccharum officinarum of South India were crossed to get sugarcane varieties of high yield, thick stems, high sugar and ability to grow in areas of North India.
           <br/>
           (viii)
           <strong>
            Millets
           </strong>
<br/>
           (a)
           <strong>
            Hybrid breeding
           </strong>
           have led to the development of several high yielding varieties resistant to water stress.
           <br/>
           (b) The successfully developed high yielding hybrid varieties are of maize, jowar and bajra.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            5.Plant breeding for disease resistance
           </strong>
           is required as a wide range of fungal, bacterial and viral pathogens which affect the yield of cultivated crop species, especially in tropical climates.
           <br/>
           (i) Resistance of the host plant is the ability to prevent the pathogen from causing disease and is determined by the genetic constitution of host plant.
           <br/>
           (ii) Development of resistance in crops enhances production and reduces the dependance on use of fungicides and bacteriocides.
           <br/>
           (iii) The causative agents of diseases in plants are:
           <br/>
           (a)
           <strong>
            Fungi
           </strong>
           disease caused are brown rust of wheat, red rot of sugarcane, late blight of potato, etc.
           <br/>
           (b)
           <strong>
            Bacteria
           </strong>
           black rot of crucifers, blight of rice, citrus canker, etc.
           <br/>
           (c)
           <strong>
            Virus
           </strong>
           tobacco mosaic, turnip mosaic, etc.
           <br/>
<strong>
            Methods of Breeding for Disease Resistance
           </strong>
<br/>
           (i) Conventional breeding is carried out in following steps:
           <br/>
           (a) Selection and screening of germplasm for the disease resistance.
           <br/>
           (b) Hybridisation of selected parent plant.
           <br/>
           (c) Selection and evaluation of hybrids.
           <br/>
           (d) Testing and release of new varieties into the market.
           <br/>
           (e) Some important varieties developed by conventional method are:
           <br/>
<img alt="important-questions-for-class-12-biology-cbse-plant-breeding-tp2-image 1jpg_Page1" class="aligncenter" height="171" loading="lazy" src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/779/23043978380_c404b0f219_o.jpg" width="667"/>
           (f) Disadvantages of this method are:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Limited number of disease resistance genes have been identified in crop varieties or wild relatives.
           </li>
</ul>

            Mutation breeding
           </strong>
           is a phenomenon by which genetic variation is achieved through changes in base sequences within genes, which creates a new character or trait absent in parental generation.
           <br/>
           (a) It can also be defined as the process of breeding by artificially inducing mutations using chemicals dr radiations.
           <br/>
           (b) Mutation breeding is carried out in the following steps:

           The major steps in breeding a new genetic variety of a crop are:
           <br/>
           (a)
           <strong>
            Collection of variability
           </strong>
           Genetic variability is the root of any breeding programmes. Wild varieties of many related crops are collected for evaluation.
           <br/>
           (b) Evaluation and selection of parents Germplasm of the identified plants are evaluated for desired characters.
           <br/>
           (c) Cross hybridisation The desired characters are obtained by crossing the wild selected species of crops.
           <br/>
           (d) Selection and testing of superior recombinants The superior plants after cross hybridisation are selected and tested in all respects before making it for commercialisation.

<br/>
<strong>
            (ii) How are somatic hybrids obtained?       [Delhi 2014]
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           (i) Tissue culture is the technique that has helped scientists to propagate plants with desirable traits on a large scale, in short duration. Since, large number of plants are propagated through this culture it is also referred to as micropropagation.
           <br/>
           The steps involved in this technique are:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Explants are derived from any part of plant (to be propagated), i.e. tips of carrot.
           </li>
<li>
            Explants are grown in sterile conditions in special nutrient media to regenerate complete plants.
           </li>
<li>
            Nutrient media must contain a carbon source (such as sucrose), organic salts, vitamins, amino acids and phytohormones, i.e. auxin and cytokinin.
           </li>
<li>
            Hence, propagation is achieved for a large number of plants under in vitro
           </li>
<li>
            All the plants obtained by tissue culture are called somaclones, since they are genetically identical to each other as well as, to the parent plant.
           </li>
</ul>
