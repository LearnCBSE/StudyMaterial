           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below carefully: [8]
           <br/>
           Postal service had its origin in the necessity of maintaining communications between different parts of an empire. It enabled the emperor to keep a track of all that was happening. Earlier the post was a privilege reserved for kings and emperors alone. Today, it is at the service of the humblest citizen.
          </p>
<p>
           All early carrier systems were run along courier routes whether in India, Egypt, China or Great Britain. Now means of communications have improved greatly and air, railway and motor services all play an important role in carrying letters speedily to their destinations. The romance of the post, however, lies in the mail-runners pass through jungles, climb hills, cross rivers, brave wild animals and dacoits to carry your letters safely.
          </p>
<p>
           The postal system has been in existence in India since 1296. The Pathan ruler, Alauddin Khilji, had a horse-and-foot postal organisation to receive regular news of the condition and progress of his army. This system was greatly improved during the time of Sher Shah who only reigned for a short time (1541 to 1545). During these five years he built a 2,000-mile road from Bengal to Sind and constructed sarais along the roads. He established horse despatches throughtout the Empire. Two horses were always kept ready at each sarai to ensure the quick transfer to despatches. A further development in the means of transport occurred during the reign of Akbar (1556 to 1605) when camels were used in addition to horses. History alos tells of Raja Chikka Deva of Mysore who organised a regular postal service throughout his dominion in 1672.

</div>
<p>
           The next constructive step was taken by the East India Company who had spread their activities to Madras, Bombay and Calcutta by 1688. A regular exchange of correspondence was necessary, so the East India Company established major post offices at Bomaby and Madras, and smaller ones at various places to receive and despatch letters. Lord Clive improved the postal system in 1766, although it was reserved for govemement use only. It was thrown open to the public in 1774. At that time, the lowest rate of letter postage was 2 annas for every 100 miles. To facilitate the payment of postage a special copper token of the value of 2 annas was struck by the mint.
          </p>

<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow: [12]
           <br/>
           The makers of fast foods fed starving soldiers stationed in remote areas, millions of those displaced by natural calamities and silenced hunger pangs of thousands during economic crises. From once being a source of sustenance, instant food—pushed by aggressive advertising—is slowly evolving as a staple diet.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           Against the backdrop of Nestle India, maker of Maggi 2-Minute Noddles, being embroiled in a scare over the product allegedly containing dangerously high level of lead, experts also highlighted the lack of nutrition in these products that are increasingly usurping the gastronomic space in the country. “People often think ’ that having instant noddles of cereal in the morning is a wholesome meal. Convenience food need not always be nutritionally sufficient,” expert says.
          </p>
<p>
           “They are calorie packed, contain more taste enhancers, little nutrition and lack fibre.
          </p>
<p>
           In noodles, for example, the vegetables, which provide fibre, are too fine and they are dehydrated. While eating them once in a while is all right, it could lead to life-long constipation if taken on a regular basis. Most of the processed food have high sodium content. To this, we add sauces, which again have high sodium content. So we are basically stuffing ourselves with a lot of sodium and little else.”
          </p>
<p>
           Experts say in several instant food products and breakfast cereals, the health benefits are either destroyed by the manufacturing process or stripped away before it is consumed. When manufacturers speak of ‘value-added’ products, they seldom look at the nutrition side, and instead look for ways to add cost to things by creating convenience. While several countries are reverting to their traditional cuisine, India is increasingly absorbing instant breakfast.
          </p>
<p>
           Consumer activists have asked the government to strengthen policy guidelines and make nutrition-fact labelling mandatory in India. ‘Right not, it is mandatory for food , products to only include the ingredients and composition. We still have a long way to go before including the nutritional content,” said former director, Food Safety and Standards Authority in India.

           <br/>
           (c) Why is it not advisable to consume instant food daily?
           <br/>
           (d) How can we make people aware of food safety and its nutritional content
           <br/>

           Sub : Use of cycles to Avoid Traffic Jams.
           <br/>
           Sir,
           <br/>
           Through the esteemed columns of your newspaper, I seek to draw the attention of the school children to use cycles instead of going to school in cars, on bikes etc. Due to over¬crowded roads and traffic jams, it is very difficult to travel to school. As we all know the air quality has reached a very dangerous level and its causing lung diseases among the students. Further, cycling promotes good physical exercise which is a must for growing children.
           <br/>
           Using cycles is very benefical for the air quality smooth traffic and physical health. If the school authorities take a strict action against the pollution-creating vehicles used for school and take his initiative seriously our young generation would be hale and hearty.
           <br/>
           Thanking You
           <br/>
           Your truly
           <br/>

           CLEAN CITY CAMPAIGN
           <br/>
           By x y z
           <br/>
           On 2nd Oct, 2014, the Prime Minister of India started “Clean City Campaign” urging the people maintain cleanliness in their houses, offices, institutes, markets, roads and other public places.
          </p>
<p>
           Our school also organised this purposeful campaign to highlight the need to live in clean and hygienic conditions. The principal of our school formed a committee of dedicated and active teachers who selected volunteers in the morning assembly. These volunteers were further divided into three groups. The taksforce, the watchdog and the campaigners. The campaigners prepared posters, charts, models and presented cultural programmes in the morning assembly. The taskforce was given the charge of cleaning the classrooms and corridors. The watchdogs supervised the work accomplished by the other two groups.
          </p>
<p>
           Thus, the volunteers worked on warfooting level and soon the whole school bore a different look—free from dust and garbage. The foul smell of decayed leaves and filhy washrooms was changed to the fragrance of flowers.
          </p>
<p>
           Through various awareness programmes, the students were trained to live in clean surroundings and hygienic conditions.

           Roshan was about the leave the platfrom, when suddenly he saw a young child following him. He thought that boy to be a beggar and offered him a one-ruppee coin. The boy refused to accept the money and followed him further. Roshan was shocked to see the boy. The boy refused to accept the money saying that he was not a beggar. Roshan asked him how could he help him? The boy told him that his name was Kamal and he had come to Delhi with his father. His father went to attend a meeting, so he left him in a park outside his office. He started playing there. Soon he started running for a kite and unfortunately lost track of his father’s office. Then he got worried because it was getting darker.

           Roshan took him to the police station. In the police station, the child rushed towards a man who was sitting there already. The man was Kamal’s father. Kamal started crying on seeing his father. His father told everyone that the child was eager to see a big city, so he had brought him to Delhi. He got scared to know that he had lost his son in such a big city but thankfully, he found Kamal back safe and sound.
