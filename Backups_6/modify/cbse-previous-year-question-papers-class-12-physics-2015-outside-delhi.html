<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Define the term ‘self-inductance’ of a coil. Write its S.I. unit. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Self-inductance of a coil is numerically equal to the amount of magnetic flux linked with the coil when unit current flows through the coil. The S.I. unit of self inductance is Henry (H) or Weber per ampere.
           <br/>
           \(1 \mathrm{H}=1 \mathrm{Wb} / \mathrm{A}\)
          </p>
<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Why does bluish color predominate in a clear sky ? (1]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           While light from the sun reaches the atmosphere that is comprised of the tiny particles of the atmosphere. These act as a prism and cause the different components to scatter. As blue light travels in shorter and smaller waves in comparison to the other colors of the spectrum, it is scattered the most, causing the sky to appear bluish.

           Question 3.
           <br/>
           I-V graph for a metallic wire at two different temperatures, T
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           and T
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           is as shown in the figure. Which of the two temperature is lower and why ? [1]
           <br/>

<br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           The slope of a V-I graph is given by the formula \(\frac{I}{V}=\frac{1}{R}\) Thus, the smaller the slope larger is the resistance. As the resistance of a metal increases with the increase in temperature, so resistance at T
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           is higher and T
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           is lower.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Which basic mode of communication is used for telephonic communication ? [1]
          </p>
<p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Why do the electrostatic field lines not form closed loops ? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           Electrostatic field lines never form loops because they do not converge at only one point as in the case with magnetic field lines. They depend on +ve and -ve charges that can extend to infinity in any particular direction.

           Question 12.
           <br/>
           Find the relation between drift velocity and relaxation time of charge carriers in a conductor. A conductor of length L is connected to a d.c. source of emf ‘E’. If the length of the conductor is tripled by stretching it, keeping ‘E’ constant, explain how its drift velocity would be affected. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           All free electrons suffer collisions with the heavy fixed ions inside the conductor. After collisions, these electrons again emerge with the same speed, but in random directions. So, at given time, net velocity of the electrons is zero
           <br/>
           i.e,

           As the drift velocity is inversely proportional to length of conductor, so the drift velocity would be reduced by one third if the length of the conductor is tripled.

           Answer :
           <br/>
           Polaroid filters are made of a special material that is capable of blocking of the two planes of vibration of an electromagnetic wave. In this sense, a polaroid acts as a device that filter out half of the vibrations on transmission of the light through the filter. When unpolarised light . is transmitted through a polaroid filter, it emerge with one-half the intensity and with vibrations in a single plane; it emerges as polarised light.

           Question 17.
           <br/>
           Write the expression for the generalized form of Ampere’s circuital law. Discuss its significance and describe briefly how the concept of displacement current is explained through charging/discharging of a capacitor in an electric circuit. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           Generalized form of Ampere circuital law:
           <br/>
           \(\oint \overrightarrow{\mathrm{B}} \cdot \overrightarrow{d l}=\mu_{0}\left(\mathrm{I}_{c}+\varepsilon_{o} \frac{d \phi}{d t}\right)\)
           <br/>
           It signifies that the source of magnetic field is not just due to the conduction electric current due to flow of charge but also due to the time rate of change of electric field called displacement current.
          </p>
<p>
           During charging and discharging of a capacitor the electric field between the plates will change, because of which there will be a change of electric flux (displacement current) between the plates.

           (b) Use this equation to explain the concept of

           (i) threshold frequency and
           <br/>
           (ii) stopping potential.
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           (a) 1. The photoelectric effect will not occur when the frequency of the incident light is less than the threshold frequency. Different materials have different threshold frequencies and most elements have threshold frequencies in the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum.
           <br/>
           2. The maximum KE of a stream of photo electrons increases linearly with the frequency of the incident light above the threshold frequency.
           <br/>
           3. The rate at which photo electrons are emitted from a photosensitive surface is directly proportional to the intensity of incident light when the frequency is constant.
           <br/>
           (b) Classical wave theory cannot explain :
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            The existence of threshold frequency because it predicts that electrons would absorb enough energy to escape and there would not be any threshold frequency.
           </li>
<li>
            The almost immediate emission of photo electrons as, according to this theory, electrons require a period of time before sufficient energy is absorbed by it to escape from the metal; however, such a thing does not happen practically.
           </li>
<li>
            It cannot explain why maximum KE is dependent on the frequency and independent of intensity.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           OR
           <br/>
           (a) The important property of photons that is useful in establishing Einstein’s photoelectric equation is their ability to
           <br/>

           Question 23.
           <br/>
           One morning an old man walked bare-foot to replace the fuse wire in kit kat fitted with power supply mains for his house. Suddenly he screamed and collapsed on the floor. His wife cried loudly for help. His neighbor’s son Anil heard the cries and rushed to the place with shoes on. He took a wooden baton and used it to switch off the main supply. [4]
           <br/>
           Answer the following questions:
           <br/>
           (i) What is the voltage and frequency of mains supply in India ?
           <br/>
           (ii) These days most of the electrical devices we use require a.c. voltage. Why ?
           <br/>
           (iii) Can a transformer be used to step up d.c. voltage ?
           <br/>
           (iv) Write two qualities displayed by Anil by his action.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) The voltage and frequency of mains supply in India are 240 V and frequency is 50 Hz.
           <br/>
           (ii) Most electrical devices require a.c. voltage because a.c. is available by default through the mains supply and also because d.c., is actually a one-way current and is available only through batteries.
           <br/>
           (iii) No, a transformer cannot be used to step- up d.c. voltage because induced emf in the secondary coil of the transformer is only due to of change of magnetic flux in primary coil.

           Question 24.
           <br/>
           (a) Define electric flux. Write its S.I. unit.
           <br/>
           “Gauss’s law in electrostatics is true for any . closed surface, no matter what its shape or size is”. Justify this statement with the help of a suitable example.
           <br/>
           (b) Use Gauss’s law to prove that electric field inside a uniformly charged spherical shell is zero. [5]
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           (a) Derive the expression for the energy stored in a parallel plate capacitor. Hence obtain the expression for the energy density of the electric field.
           <br/>
           (b) A fully charged parallel plate capacitor is connected across an uncharged identical capacitor. Show that the energy stored in the combination is less than that stored initially in the single capacitor.
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           (a) The electric flux through an area is defined as the electric field multiplied by the area of the surface projected on a plane, perpendicular to the field. Its S.I. unit is voltmeter (Vm) or Newton meter square per coulomb (Nm

</span>
           ). The given statement is justified because while measuring the flux, the surface area is more important than its volume or its size.
           <br/>
           (b) To prove that the electric field inside a uniformly charged spherical shell is zero, we place a single positive point charge ‘q’ at the center of an imaginary spherical surface with radius R. The field lines of this point radiate outside equally in all directions. The magnitude E of the electric field at every point on the surface
           <br/>
           \(\text { is given by } \mathrm{E}=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \times \frac{q}{\mathrm{R}^{2}}\)
           <br/>
           At each point on the surface, \(\vec{E}\) is ⊥ to the surface and its magnitude is the same.
           <br/>
           Thus, the total electric flux (ΦE) is the product of their field magnitude E and the A.
           <br/>
           Hence, \(\begin{aligned} \phi_{\mathrm{E}} &amp;=\mathrm{EA} \\ &amp;=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q}{\mathrm{R}^{2}}\left(4 \pi \varepsilon \mathrm{R}^{2}\right) \\ &amp;=\frac{q}{\varepsilon_{0}} \end{aligned}\)
          </p>
<p>
           If the sphere is uniformly charged, then there is zero charge inside the sphere, according to Gauss’s law
           <br/>
           When \(q=0, \phi_{\mathrm{E}}=\frac{0}{\varepsilon_{0}}=0\)
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           (a) Consider a capacitor of capacitance C. Initial charge on capacitor is zero. Initial potential difference between capacitor plates is zero. Let a charge Q be given to it in small steps. When charge is given to capacitor, the potential difference between its plates increases. Let at any instant when charge on capacitor be q, the potential difference between its plates
           <br/>
           \(\mathrm{v}=\frac{q}{\mathrm{c}}\)
           <br/>
           Now work done in giving an additional infinitesimal charge d

           \(d \mathrm{W}=\mathrm{V} d q=\frac{q}{\mathrm{C}} d q\)

           (ii) voltage sensitivity of a galvanometer. Why does increasing the current sensitivity not necessarily increase voltage sensitivity ? [5]

           Answer :
           <br/>
           The basic principle of a moving coil galvanometer is that when a current carrying coil is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque.

           (ii) The soft iron core increases the strength of the magnetic field.
           <br/>
           The current sensitivity is defined as the deflection produced in the galvanometer, while passing a current of 1 ampere. (1 amp), through it
           <br/>
           Thus, current sensitivity \(\left(\frac{\alpha}{\mathrm{I}}\right)=\frac{\mathrm{NBA}}{\mathrm{K}}\)

           The voltage sensitivity is defined as the deflection produced in the galvanometer when a potential difference of IV is applied to the coil.

           Consider a conducting element dl of the loop. The magnetic field due to dl is given by the Biot- Savart law,
           <br/>
           \(\begin{array}{l}{d \mathrm{B}=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4 \pi} \frac{i|\vec{d}| \times \vec{r} |}{r^{3}}} \\ {d \mathrm{B}=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4 \pi} \frac{i d l}{\left(\mathrm{R}^{2}+x^{2}\right)}}\end{array}\)
          </p>
<p>
           The direction of dB is perpendicular to the plane formed by dl and r. It has an X-component dB
           <sub>
            x
           </sub>
           and a component perpendicular to X-axis, dB
           <sub>
            ⊥y
           </sub>
           . When the components perpendicular to the X-axis are summed over, they cancel out and we obtain null result. Thus, only the X-component survives.

           Question 26.
           <br/>
           (a) Consider two coherent sources S
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           and S
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           producing monochromatic waves to produce interference pattern. Let the displacement of the wave produced by S
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           be given by Y
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           = a cos ωt and the displacement by S
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           be Y
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           = a cos (ωt + Φ). Find out the expression for the amplitude of the resultant displacement at a point and show that the intensity at that point will be I = 4a

<br/>
           Plot a graph showing the variation of the angle of deviation as a function of angle of incidence. State the condition under which ∠δ is minimum.
           <br/>
           (b) Find out the relation between the refractive index (μ) of the glass prism and ∠A for the case when the angle of prism (A) is equal to the angle of minimum deviation (δ
           <sub>
            m
           </sub>
           ). Hence obtain the value of the refractive index for angle of prism A = 60°.

           (ii) The different colors of white light will produce different interference patterns but the central bright fringes due to all colors are at the same positions. Therefore, the central bright fringe is white in color. Since the wavelength of the blue light is smallest, the fringe closed on the either side of the central white fringe is blue and farthest is red. Beyond a few fringes, no clear fringe pattern is visible.
