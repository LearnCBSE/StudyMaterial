           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Four advantages of properly managed watershed management are:
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<ol>
<li>
            Watershed management emphasizes scientific soil and water conservation in order to increase the biomass production. It strictly maintains the water quality.
           </li>
<li>
            Watershed management develops primary resources of land and water, to produce secondary resources of plants and animals for use in a manner which will not cause ecological imbalance.
           </li>
<li>
            Watershed management increases the production and income of the watershed community.
           </li>
<li>
            It mitigates droughts and floods and increases the life of the downstream dam and reservoirs.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
            Question.6. Explain giving example where active involvement of local people lead to efficient management of forest.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
            People’s participation in the management of forests can help in increasing forest produce as well as in their conservation. ‘
           </li>
<li>
            In 1972, the West Bengal Forest Department formulated a novel scheme to revive the degraded Sal forests by involving the local people.
           </li>
<li>
            A far sighted forest officer A.K. Banerjee involved the villagers of the area around the forest in the protection of 1272 hectares of badly degraded Sal forest.
           </li>
<li>
            In return for help in protecting the forest, the villagers were given employment in both silviculture and harvesting operations of the forest, 25% of the final harvest produce, and were allowed to collect firewood and fodder from the forest area on nominal payment.
           </li>
<li>
            With the active and willing participation of local people living around the forest, the degraded Sal forest of Arabari became thick and green within ten years.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
            Question.7. What are covalent compounds? Why are they different from ionic compounds? List their three characteristic properties.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
            The chemical bond formed by the sharing of electrons between two atoms is known as a covalent bond. The molecules formed by sharing of electrons between two or more same atoms or between two or more non-metals are called covalent compounds.
           </li>
<li>
            Covalent compounds are different from ionic compounds as ionic compounds are formed by transference of electrons.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
            Characteristics of covalent compounds:

<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Calcium (Ca)
           <br/>
           Atomic number = 20 Electronic configuration = 2, 8, 8, 2
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            It is a metal as it has two electrons in its outermost shell and it loses these two electrons to acquire inert gas configuration and form +2 ion.
           </li>
<li>
            Potassium (atomic number 19) is placed before Calcium (atomic number 20) in the same period (IV period). Therefore, size of Ca is smaller than K since on moving from left to right in a period of the periodic table, the size of the atoms decreases. As on moving from left to right in a period, the atomic number of the elements increases which means that the number of protons and electrons in the atoms increases (the extra electrons being added to the same shell). Due to large positive charge on the nucleus, the outermost shell is pulled with more force by the nucleus, it moves closer to the nucleus and the size of the atom decreases.
           </li>
<li>
            The oxide of calcium is calcium oxide (CaO).

            Question.11. How do organisms, whether reproduced asexually or sexually maintain a constant chromosome number through several generations? Explain with the help of suitable example.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
            When organisms reproduce asexually, a basic event in reproduction is the creation of a DNA copy. Cells use chemical reactions to build copies of their DNA. This creates two copies of the DNA in a reproducing cell, and they will need to be separated from each other. However, keeping one copy of DNA in the original cell and simply pushing the other one out would not work, because the copy pushed out would not have any organised cellular structure for maintaining life processes. Therefore, DNA copying is accompanied by the creation of an additional cellular apparatus, and then DNA copies separate, each with its own cellular apparatus. Effectively, a cell divides to give rise to two cells. Thus, chromosome number remains unchanged. For example, reproduction of amoeba by binary fission.
           </li>
<li>
            In sexual reproduction, organisms produce gametes through a special type of division, meiosis —reductional division, in which the original number of chromosomes becomes half. These two gametes then combine to form the zygote and the original number of chromosomes is restored as in the case of human beings.
           </li>
</ul>

            Question.13. Suggest three contraceptive methods to control the size of human population which is essential for the health and prosperity of a country. State the basic principle involved in each.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           There are three different methods of contraception:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
             Barrier methods.
            </strong>
            In these methods, physical devices such as condoms, diaphragms and cervical caps are used. These devices prevent the entry of sperm in the female genital tract, thus acting as a barrier between them.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Surgical methods.
            </strong>
            There are surgeries that can be carried out in males and females. In males, a small portion of the sperm duct (vas deferens) is blocked by a surgical operation. This prevents the sperms from coming out.
            <br/>
            In females, a small portion of the fallopian tubes (oviducts) is blocked by a surgical operation. It prevents the egg from reaching the uterus. In both the cases, fertilisation will not take place.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Chemical methods.
            </strong>
            This category of contraceptives acts by changing the hormonal balance of the body so that eggs are not released and fertilisation cannot occur. Females use two types of pills for preventing pregnancies, i.e., oral pills and vaginal pills. The oral pills contain hormones which stop the ovaries from releasing ovum into the fallopian tube. This is also called oral contraceptives (OC). Other contraceptive devices such as loop or the copper-T are placed in the uterus to prevent pregnancy.

            Question.17. Why does the sun appear reddish early in the morning? Will this phenomenon be observed by an observer on the moon? Justify your answer with a reason.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           The sun at sunrise (early in the morning) is located near the horizon of the earth. Light from the sun near the horizon has to pass through thick layers of air and a large distance through the earth’s atmosphere before reaching our eyes. Near the horizon, most of the blue light rays with shorter wavelength are scattered away by the particles in the atmosphere. Therefore, the light that reaches our eyes is the red light of longer wavelengths. This gives rise to the reddish appearance of the sun.
           <br/>
           This phenomenon will not be observed by an observer on the moon because there is no atmosphere on the moon to. scatter light.

<strong>
             The existence of decomposers is essential in a biosphere.
            </strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
             Flow of energy in a food chain is unidirectional.
            </strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
            Decomposers break down complex organic substances (dead remains and waste products of organisms) into simpler inorganic substances that can be absorbed by the plants. They are essential for the proper functioning of an ecosystem.
            <br/>
            • Decomposers play an important role in the cycling of materials in the biosphere.
            <br/>
            • By decomposing dead bodies of plants and animals they help irt cleaning the environment.
            <br/>
            • They replenish the soil naturally.
           </li>
<li>
            In the ecosystem energy flows from one trophic level to the next trophic level of the food chain. Energy flows from producers, i.e., green plants to the consumers. It does not flow from the last consumers to its previous consumers and so on. The energy captured by the autotrophs does not go back to the solar input. Thus the energy does not flow back from consumers to the producers. Hence the flow of energy in a food chain is unidirectional.

<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           (a) Bromine water test. The addition of bromine (Br
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           ) gives addition reactions with unsaturated compounds (like alkenes and alkynes). The addition of bromine is used as a test for unsaturated compounds. For this purpose, bromine is used in the form of bromine water. A solution of bromine in water is called bromine water. Bromine water has a red-brown colour due to the presence of bromine in it. When bromine water is added to an unsaturated compound, then bromine gets added to the unsaturated compound and the red-brown colour of bromine water is discharged. So, if an organic compound decolourises bromine water, then it will be an unsaturated hydrocarbon (containing a double bond or a triple bond), but saturated hydrocarbon (alkanes) do not decolourise bromine water.
           <br/>
           (b) When ethane bums in air, carbon dioxide and water vapours are formed along with heat and light.

<br/>
           In this reaction, one ‘H’ atom of methane has been substituted (replaced) by a ‘Cl’ atom, converting CH

           <br/>
           (b) Structure of placenta. Placenta is the link between the mother’s body and the baby (embryo). It is a disc like structure embedded in the uterine wall connected to the embryo. It has villi on the embryo’s side of the tissue and on the mother’s side, it has blood spaces which surround the villi.
           <br/>
           Function of placenta. It provides a large surface area for nutrients (glucose) and oxygen to pass from the mother’s side to the embryo and waste substances from the embryo’s side to the mother’s blood.

            Question.21. What is meant by speciation? List four factors that could lead to speciation. Which of these cannot be a major factor in the speciation of a self-pollinating plant species. Give reason to justify your answer.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
<strong>
            Speciation.
           </strong>
           The process by which new species develop from the existing species by evolution or any genetic modification of previous species is known as speciation.
           <br/>
           The important factors which could lead to the formation of new species are:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
             Geographical isolation
            </strong>
            of a population caused by various types of barriers like mountain ranges, rivers, sea etc. The geographical isolation leads to reproductive isolation due to which there is no flow of genes between separated groups of population.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Genetic drift
            </strong>
            caused by drastic changes in the frequencies of particular genes by’ chance alone,
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Variations
            </strong>
            caused in individuals due to natural selection.
           </li>
<li>
            Drastic change in the genes or DNA called mutation is also a cause of speciation. Reproductive isolation can not be a major factor for the speciation of a self-pollinating plant species as it does not depend on any other plant for its reproduction process.
           </li>
</ol>

<br/>
<strong>
            (iii) List two values which are developed in the persons who actively participate and contribute in such programmes.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           (a) Functions of the following parts of human eye:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
             Cornea.
            </strong>
            The front part of the eye is called cornea. It is made up of a transparent substance. The light coming from objects enters the eye through cornea.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Iris.
            </strong>
            This is a flat, coloured, ring-shaped membrane behind the cornea. Pupil is a hole in the middle of the iris. Iris controls the size of the pupil.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Crystalline lens.
            </strong>
            Eye lens is a convex lens which focuses the image of the object on the retina.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Ciliary muscles.
            </strong>
            Ciliary muscles hold the eye lens and changes the thickness of eye-lens while focussing.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           (b) (i) Objective of such campaigns. To make people aware of corneal blindness and make them realise their duties towards the society by taking pledge for eye donation.
           <br/>
           (ii) • One pair of eyes can give eyesight to two corneal blind persons (each getting one eye), and make them see this beautiful world.
           <br/>
           • Our eyes can live even after our death. People belonging to all age groups, even people with medical conditions like cataract, diabetes, hypertension can donate their eyes.
           <br/>
           (iii) Values developed in persons who actively participate in such programmes:
           <br/>
           • Concern for others and social welfare.
           <br/>
           • Responsible behaviour and awareness.

            Question.11. What are the functions of testes in the human male reproductive system? Why are these located outside the abdominal cavity? Who is responsible for bringing about changes in appearance seen in boys at the time of puberty?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Functions of testes are:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            to make male sex cells (or male gametes) called sperms.
           </li>
<li>
            to make the male sex hormone called testosterone.
           </li>
<li>
            The testes of a man lie in a small muscular pouch called scrotum outside the abdominal cavity of the body. This is because the sperm formation requires a lower temperature than the normal body temperature. Being outside the abdominal cavity, the temperature of scrotum is about 3° C lower than the temperature inside the body and thus the testes are provided an optimal temperature for the formation of sperms. The male sex hormone testosterone is responsible for bringing about changes in ‘ appearance seen in boys at the time of puberty.

            Question.13. What is multiple fission? How does it occur in an organism? Explain briefly. Name one organism which exhibits this type of reproduction.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Multiple fission. The process of asexual reproduction in which many individuals are produced from the parent cell Process. Sometimes during unfavourable conditions a protective wall or cyst is formed around the cell of a single celled organism (like in plasmodium). Inside the cyst, the nucleus of the cell splits several times to form many smaller nuclei called daughter nuclei. Each nucleus gathers a bit of cytoplasm around itself, develops a membrane around each structure. Thus many daughter cells develop which on liberation grow into adult organisms. Plasmodium exhibits multiple fission.

            Question.14. How did Mendel interpret his result to show that traits may be dominant or recessive? Describe briefly.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
            In Mendel’s experiment with pea plants, when he cross bred a pure tall pea plant with a pure dwarf pea plant, he found that the first generation F
            <sub>
             1
            </sub>
            was of only tall plants. Tallness is the dominant trait.
           </li>
<li>
            Then he produced F
            <sub>
             2
            </sub>
            generation by selling of hybrids F
            <sub>
             1
            </sub>
            .
           </li>
<li>
            In the T
            <sub>
             1
            </sub>
            progeny, no dwarf plants were obtained. However in F
            <sub>
             2
            </sub>
            generation, both tall and dwarf plants were obtained in the ratio 3 : 2 respectively.
           </li>
<li>
            The trait which remains hidden in F, generation, i.e., dwarfness is the recessive trait.
           </li>
<li>
            He observed that even when riot expressed in the first generation, alternate forms of a trait could retain their identify in the hybrid and could re-emerge in the next generation.

<strong>
            Question.16. What is meant by scattering of light? The sky appears blue and the Sun appears reddish at sunrise and sunset. Explain these phenomena with reason.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Scattering of light. The phenomenon of spreading of light when it falls on various types of suspended particles in its path is called scattering of light.
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            The sky appears blue because of scattering of white light that takes place in the atmosphere. The molecules of air and other fine particles suspended in the atmosphere have a size smaller than the wavelength of visible light. So these particles scatter more effectively the light rays of shorter wavelength at the blue end than light rays of longer wavelengths at the red end. Thus, when sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the fine particles in air scatter blue light. When the scattered blue light enters our eyes, it gives us the feeling of a blue sky.
           </li>
<li>
            The sun at sunrise and at sunset time is located very near to the horizon of the earth. Hence light has to travel a long distance through the earth’s atmosphere. Near the horizon most of the blue light of shorter wavelength is scattered away by the particles in the atmosphere. Therefore, the red light of longer wavelengths is least scattered by the air particles and is able to reach our eyes. This gives rise to the reddish appearance of the Sun at sunrise and sunset.
           </li>

            Question.6. “Reuse is better than recycling of materials”. Give reason to justify this statement.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           The ‘reuse’ strategy is better than ‘recycling’ because even the process of recycling uses large amount of energy and money. In the reuse strategy we can preserve energy. For instance, plastic bottles in which we buy various food items like jam and pickle can be used for storing things in the kitchen. Whereas, if we send the discarded plastic bottles for recycling to the industry, we will be using energy sources for the recycling process.

           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
            When ethanol is heated with excess of concentrated sulphuric acid at 170° C (443K) it gets dehydrated to form ethene (an unsaturated hydrocarbon).
            <br/>

</li>
<li>
            In this reaction, concentrated sulphuric acid acts as a dehydrating agent which removes water molecule from the ethanol molecule.
           </li>
<li>
            If hydrogen is added to the ethene (product of above reaction) in the presence of catalysts like palladium or nickel then one atom of H adds to each carbon atom of ethene due to which the double bond opens up to form a single bond in ethane.

            Law of Segregation:

<br/>
           When plants of two different traits of character are cross bred to get a progeny (F
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           generation), only the dominant trait is visible in this generation. But when plants of F
           <sub>
            1

           generation are self bred then the two traits of character get separated and the recessive traits also appears in the plant of F

            Law of Dominance:
           </strong>
<br/>
           According to this law, the characteristics (or traits) of an organism are determined by internal ‘factors’ which occur in pairs. Only one of a pair of such factors can be presented in a single gamete. This law explains expression of only of the parental character in F

            Question.17. State the cause of dispersion of white light passing through a glass prism. How did Newton show that white light of Sun contains seven colours using two identical glass prisms. Draw a ray diagram to show the path of light when two identical glass prisms are arranged together in inverted position with respect to each other and a narrow beam of white light is allowed to fall obliquely on one of the focus of the first prism.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
            White light is a mixture of lights of seven colours, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. The dispersion of white light occurs because colours of white light travel at different speeds through the glass prism. The amount of refraction depends on the speed of coloured light in glass.
           </li>
<li>
            When white light consisting of seven colours falls on a glass prism, each colour in it is refracted by a different angle, with the result that seven colours are spread out to form a spectrum. The red light bends the least, while violet bends the most.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
            Newton s experiment with two identical prisms:
           </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
            When a beam of white light is passed through a glass prism, a band of seven colours is formed on a white screen. This band of seven colours is called spectrum of white light.
           </li>
<li>
            Newton showed that the seven coloured lights of the spectrum can be recombined to give back white light.
           </li>
<li>
            First he tried to split the colours of the spectrum of white light using a prism.
           </li>
<li>
            He then placed a second identical prism in an inverted position with respect to the first prism. This allowed all the colours of the spectrum to pass through the second prism. He found a beam of white light emerging from the other side of the second prism.
