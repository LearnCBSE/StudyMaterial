           Or
           <br/>
           Why did merchants from towns in Europe begin to move to the countryside in seventeenth and eighteenth centuries? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In 1885, the big European powers met in Berlin to complete the carving up (division) of Africa between them.

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Why did the Roman Catholic Church impose control over publishers and booksellers? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Menocchio, a miller in Italy, reinterpreted the message of the Bible and formulated a view of God and creation, that enraged the Roman Catholic Church. When the Roman Church began questioning heretics (Heretic: holder of an opinion contrary to the official doctrine of the Church) to repress heretical ideas, Menocchio was hauled up twice and ultimately executed. The Roman Church, disturbed by such effects of popular readings and the questioning of faith, imposed severe controls over publishers and booksellers and began to maintain an Index of Prohibited Books from 1558.

           Or
           <br/>
           Describe any three major problems faced by Indian cotton weavers in nineteenth century. [1 × 3 = 3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Coming of rinderpest to Africa. Rinderpest, a cattle plague, was brought to Africa by the – infected cattle imported from British Asia to feed the Italian soldiers invading Eritrea in East Africa. Entering in the East, rinderpest travelled towards the West like forest fire reaching up to Africa’s Atlantic coast and later the Cape.
          </p>
<p>
           Effect. The arrival of rinderpest devastated the cattle population. It killed 90 per cent of the cattle. The loss of cattle destroyed African livelihoods and most of the small holders of livestock were forced to join the labour market monopolised by planters, mine owners and colonial governments.
           <br/>
           Or, WeaverSf specially cotton weavers, in India faced many problems at the same time:
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           (i) Their export market collapsed.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) The local market shrank being flooded by the Manchester imports. Produced by machines at lower costs, the Manchester cotton goods were so cheap that they attracted the buyers and the Indian textiles could not compete with them.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) By 1860, Indian weavers faced a new problem. They could not get sufficient supply of raw cotton of good quality. This happened because a Civil War had broken out in America and the cotton supplies from the US to Britain were cut off and Britain turned to India. As raw cotton export from India increased, the price of raw cotton shot up. Indian weavers were forced to buy raw cotton at a very high price, so weaving did not remain profitable.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) Factories in India also produced goods at a mass scale which flooded the Indian markets. Thus, the Indian weavers faced a tough time and it became difficult to survive.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 9.
           <br/>
           “The ‘Print Revolution’ had transformed the lives of people changing their relationship to information and knowledge.” Analyse the statement. [1 × 3 = 3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Before the age of print, reading was restricted to educated elite as books were not
           <br/>
           only expensive but they could not be produced in sufficient numbers. Common people lived in a world of oral culture. Printing not only made production faster, it also brought down cost of production and as a result books could reach out to a wider section of people.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Most of the common people, particularly the illiterate, lived in a world of oral culture. Books of various kinds were read out to them. They heard sacred texts read out, ballads recited and folk tales narrated. Knowledge was passed on orally. People collectively heard a story or saw a performance.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Printers began publishing popular ballads and folk tales which were profusely illustrated with pictures. These were then sung and recited at gatherings in villages and in taverns in towns.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) Printing created the possibility of wide circulation of ideas- and introduced a new world of debate, discussion and public opinion. Those who disagreed with the established authorities, could propagate their ideas through the print medium and persuade people to think differently and move them to action.
          </p>

           (i) Industries are heavy users of fresh water as water is required for cooling the machines as well as for the processing of goods.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Also the machines run on the power supplied by the hydel power plants.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) 22 percent of the total electricity is hydroelectric power.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) Rapid urbanisation has led to expansion of industries which increased the requirement of water.
          </p>
<p>
           (V) The untreated industrial effluents which are discharged into water bodies are – polluting the water and making it hazardous for human consumption. This is
           <br/>
           responsible for creating water scarcity.
          </p>

           Question 11.
           <br/>
           “Dense and efficient network of transport is a pre-requisite for local and national development.” Analyse the statement. [3 × 1 = 3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Economic development of a country depends on the well developed and efficient means of transport and communication. They are indispensable for movement of people, goods and services from one place to another.
           <br/>
           (i) Means of transport help to carry raw materials to production centres and from A manufacturing hubs to markets in very little time.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) It enables goods to reach newer markets and allows people greater accessibility to goods and services.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) They have contributed to socio-economic progress in many ways by connecting far flung areas of the country. They have enriched all aspects of our lives — social, cultural, individual and economic.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) They promote trade, tourism and business thus adding value to the economy. Transport and communication have made possible international trade which is essential for every economy as no country is self-sufficient in all resources.
          </p>
<p>
           (v) They link areas of production with consumption, i.e., agricultural farms are linked to the markets and industries.
          </p>
<p>
           (vi) They help in the balanced regional development of a country. Deficient areas can obtain resources from the regions of surplus, thereby making the interdependence among the regions possible.
          </p>
<p>
           (vii) They have added substantially to growing amenities and facilities for the comforts of life.
          </p>

           Question 12.
           <br/>
           Describe any three provisions of amendment made in ‘Indian Constitution’ in 1992 for making ‘Three-Tier’ government more effective and powerful. [3 × 1 = 3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In order to make ‘three-tier’ government more effective and powerful, major steps towards decentralisation were taken in 1992:
           <br/>
           (i) Now it is constitutionally mandatory to hold regular elections to Local Government bodies.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Seats are reserved in elected bodies for scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and other backward classes (OBCs).
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) At least one-third of all positions are reserved for women.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) The State Election Commission was created to conduct Panchayat and Municipal elections.
          </p>
<p>
           (v) The State Governments are required to share some powers and revenue with Local Government bodies.

           Question 13.
           <br/>
           Explain the three factors that are crucial in deciding the outcome of politics of social division. [1 × 3 = 3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Three factors determining the outcome of social divisions in politics are:
           <br/>
           (i) How people perceive their identities. If people see their identities in exclusive terms, it becomes difficult to accommodate them. As long as people in Northern Ireland saw themselves as only Catholic or Protestant, their differences were difficult to reconcile. It is easier if identities are complementary with national identities. This helps to stay together. This is how most people in our country see their identity. They feel and think as Indian as well as belonging to a State or a language group or a social or religious group.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) How political leaders raise demands of any community. It is easier to accommodate demands that are within the constitutional framework and are not at the cost of another community. The demand for ‘only Sinhala’ was at the cost of the interest and identity of the Tamil community in Sri Lanka.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) How Government reacts to demands of different groups. If the rulers are willing to share power and accommodate the reasonable demands of minority community, as in Belgium, social divisions become less threatening for the country. But if the
           <br/>
           demand is suppressed in the name of national unity, as in Sri Lanka, the end result is quite opposite. Such attempts at forced integration sow the seeds of disintegration.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 14.
           <br/>
           Differentiate between the Federal System in India with that of Federal System in the USA. [1 × 3 = 3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Both the USA and India have federal form of governments. But the structure of both the federalism is different.

           Question 15.
           <br/>
           How is the issue of sustainability important for development? Explain with examples. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Development of a country needs to be continuous. Every country would like to have
           <br/>
           the level of development go up further.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Many scientists have warned that the present levels of development cannot be sustained for the future as the present rate of consumption of both renewable and non-renewable resources is very high. Resources are limited in supply and hence should be used judiciously.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Sustainable development aims at development without damaging the environment and at the same time conserving for the future.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) Development should take place in the present without compromising the needs of the future. Sustainability of development is essential not only for the present generation but also for future generations to ensure a good life.

           Question 16.
           <br/>
           Distinguish the service conditions of organized sector with that of unorganized sector. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Organized sector:
           <br/>
           (i) It is registered by the government and follows its rules and regulations which are given in various laws (Example, Factory Act, Minimum Wages Act, Payment of Gratuity Act, Shop and Establishment Act, etc.).
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Workers in Organized sector enjoy job security, work for a fixed number of hours, get overtime if they work more than the fixed number of hours.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) They enjoy certain benefits like paid leave, payment during holidays, Provident Fund and gratuity, etc.
          </p>
<p>
           Unorganized sector:
           <br/>
           (i) By the unorganised sector, we usually mean small and scattered industries. They are largely outside the government jurisdiction.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Jobs are usually low paid and not regular. There is no security of jobs. Labour exploitation may exist. Employers are masters who can ask workers to leave whenever they so desire. Usually, it is done when there is less work. (Example, hired labourers in farms, tailors in a garment-making factory involved in export.)
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Workers in Unorganized sector do not enjoy the benefits which are enjoyed by the workers in the Organized sector.

           Question 17.
           <br/>
           Why is cheap and affordable credit important for the country’s development? Explain any three reasons. [1 × 3 = 3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Cheap and affordable credit is crucial for the country’s growth and economic ‘ development because of the following reasons:
           <br/>
           (i) Credit is in great demand for various kinds of economic activities — big or small investments, to set up business, buying cars, houses, etc.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) In rural areas credit helps in the development of agriculture by providing funds to farmers to buy seeds, fertilizers, expensive pesticides, modern machinery, etc.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Manufacturers need credit for buying raw material or to meet ongoing expenditure A of production. Credit helps in the purchase of plant, machinery, equipment, etc.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) Som,e people may need to borrow for illness, marriages, etc.
          </p>

           Question 19.
           <br/>
           Describe the explosive conditions that prevailed in Balkans after 1871 in Europe. [5 × 1 = 5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The nationalist tensions emerged in the Balkans due to the following reasons:
           <br/>
           (i) Balkans was a region of geographical and ethnic variation comprising modern-day Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Greece, Macedonia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Slovenia, Serbia and Montenegro whose inhabitants were known as the Slavs. A large part of Balkans was under the control of the Ottoman empire.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) After the decline of the Ottoman empire and the growth of romantic nationalism in the Balkans, the region became very explosive. Its European subject nationalities broke away from its control and declared independence.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) In 19th century, the Ottoman Empire strengthened through modernisation and internal reforms but there was no success. The Balkan people based their claims for political rights on nationality and used history to prove their independence. The rebellious nationalities used their struggle to win their lost independence.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) As the different nationalities struggled to define their identity and independence, the Balkan area became an area of intense conflict. The Balkan States were fiercely jealous of each other and each hoped to gain more territory at the expense of others.
          </p>
<p>
           (v) Balkan also became the scene of big power rivalry. Russia, Germany, England, Austria, Hungary — all big powers were keen in countering the hold of other powers. This ultimately turned Balkan into a war region which eventually provided a minor cause for the First World War.

           Question 20.
           <br/>
           How did Non-Cooperation movement start with participation of middle class people in the cities? Explain its impact on the economic front. [2 + 3 = 5]
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Why was Congress reluctant to allow women to hold any position of authority within the organisation? How did women participate in Civil Disobedience Movement? Explain. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In the cities, the movement started with middle class participation:
           <br/>
           (i) Thousands of students left government-controlled schools and colleges. Headmasters and teachers resigned and lawyers gave up their legal practices.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) The Council elections were boycotted in most provinces except Madras.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Foreign goods and foreign cloth was boycotted. Traders and merchants also refused to trade in foreign goods.
          </p>
<p>
           The economic sphere was affected by the Non-Cooperation Movement:
           <br/>
           (i) Foreign goods were boycotted, liquor shops were picketed and foreign cloth was burnt. The import of foreign cloth halved between 1921-1922. Its value dropped from ?102 crores to ?57 crores.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Many merchants and traders refused to trade in foreign goods or finance foreign A trade.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) People began discarding imported clothes and wearing Indian ones.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) The production of Indian textile mills and handlooms went up. Use of khadi was popularised.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Moved by Gandhiji’s call, women began to see service to the nation as a sacred duty. But, this increased public role did not mean any radical change in the position of women was visualised. Gandhiji was convinced that it was the duty of the women to look after home, be good mothers and wives.
           <br/>
           Congress, too for a long time was reluctant to allow women to hold any position of authority within the organisation. It was keen only on their symbolic presence.
           <br/>
           An important feature of the Civil Disobedience Movement was large-scale participation of women—
           <br/>
           (i) Women came out of their homes to listen to Gandhiji.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) They participated in protest marches, manufactured salt and picketed foreign cloth . and liquor shops. Many women went to jail.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Women who participated in the Civil Disobedience Movement, came from high- caste families in urban areas and rich peasant households in rural areas.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 21.
           <br/>
           “The Government of India has introduced various institutional and technological reforms to improve agriculture in the 1980s and 1990s.” Support this statement with examples. [1 + 4 = 5]
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Compare ‘Intensive Subsistence Farming’ with that of ‘Commercial Farming’ practiced in India. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Institutional reforms. Steps taken by the government to bring about improvements in agriculture are termed as ‘Institutional Reforms’.
           <br/>
           Some steps are:
           <br/>
           (i) Provision of crop insurance to protect the farmers against losses caused by natural calamities, i.e., drought, flood, cyclone, fire and disease.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Establishment of ‘Grameen Banks’, Cooperative Societies and Banks for providing loan facilities to the farmers at lower rates of interest.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Kissan Credit Card (KCC), Personal Accident Insurance Scheme (PAIS) are some other schemes introduced by the government for the benefit of farmers.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) Special weather bulletins and agricultural programmes for farmers were introduced on the Radio and TV.
          </p>
<p>
           The following measures have been taken by the government to modernise agriculture and improve its share in the GDP:
           <br/>
           (i) Establishment of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR).
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Setting up of Agricultural Universities.
          </p>
<p>
           (iiii) Development of advanced veterinary services and Animal Breeding Centres.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) Development of horticulture.
          </p>
<p>
           (v) Research and development in the field of meteorology and weather forecasts, etc.
           <br/>
           Or

           Question 22.
           <br/>
           Why is the economic strength of a country measured by the development of manufacturing industries? Explain with examples. [5 × 1 = 5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Production of goods in large quantities after processing from raw materials to more valuable products is called manufacturing.
           <br/>
           Manufacturing belongs to the secondary sector in which the primary materials are processed and converted into finished goods. The economic strength of a country is measured by the development of manufacturing industries.
           <br/>
           Importance of manufacturing industries for development in India:
           <br/>
           (i) It helps in modernising agriculture, which is the base of our economy.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) It reduces heavy dependence on agricultural income by providing jobs in non- agricultural sectors.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Industrial development is necessary for eradication of poverty and unemployment because people get jobs and generate more income.

           Question 23.
           <br/>
           Describe any five major functions of political parties performed in a democracy. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           To fill political offices and exercise political power, political parties are needed to perform a series of functions, which are the following:
           <br/>
           (i) Parties contest elections. Elections are fought mainly among candidates put up by political parties. In India, top party leaders choose candidates for contesting elections.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Parties put forward different policies and programmes. Political parties in a democracy group together similar opinions, to provide a direction in which government policies can be formulated.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Parties make laws for a country. Laws are debated and passed in the legislature.
           <br/>
           (iv) Parties that lose elections play the role of the opposition. Opposition parties voice their views by criticising government for its failure or wrong policies.
          </p>
<p>
           (v) Parties shape public opinion. They raise and highlight issues and resolve people’s problems. Many pressure groups are the extensions of political parties.
          </p>
<p>
           (vi) Parties provide people access to government machinery and welfare schemes. For an ordinary citizen it is easy to approach a local party leader than a government officer.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 24.
           <br/>
           “Democracy stands much superior to any other form of government in promoting dignity and freedom of the individual.” Justify this statement. [5]
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           “Democracies lead to peaceful and harmonious life among citizens.” Justify this statement. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Examples to illustrate that dignity and freedom of citizens are best guaranteed in a democracy:
           <br/>
           (i) Dignity of women. Democracy recognises dignity of women as a necessary ingredient of society. The one way to ensure that women related problems get adequate attention is to have more women as elected representatives. To achieve this, it is legally binding to have a fair proportion of women in the elected bodies. Panchayati Raj in India has reserved one-third seats in local government bodies for women. In March 2010, the Women’s Reservation Bill was passed in the Rajya Sabha ensuring 33% reservation for women in Parliament and State legislative bodies.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Democracy has strengthened the claims of disadvantaged and discriminated castes. When governments are formed, political parties usually take care that representatives of different castes and tribes find a place in it. Some political parties are known to favour some castes. Democracy provides for equal status and opportunities for all castes.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Democracy transforms people from the status of a subject into that of a citizen. A democracy is concerned with ensuring that people will have the right to choose their rulers and people will have control over the rulers. Whenever possible and necessary, citizens should be able to participate in decision-making that affects them all.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) A citizen has the right and the means to examine the process of decision-making. There is transparency in a democracy like India. In October 2005, the Right to Information (RTI) law was passed which ensures all its citizens the right to get all the information about the functions of the government departments. In a democracy, people also have the right to complain about its functioning.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           No society can fully and permanently resolve conflicts among different groups. But we can certainly learn to respect these differences and evolve a mechanism to negotiate the differences. Belgium is an example of how successfully differences were negotiated among ethnic groups. Therefore, democracy is best suited to accommodate various social divisions as it usually develops a procedure to conduct their competition. But the example of Sri Lanka shows how distrust between two communities turned into widespread conflict.
           <br/>
           Thus, a democracy must fulfil the following conditions and be based on these values in order to achieve a harmonious social life —
          </p>
<p>
           (i) Majority and minority opinions are not permanent. Democracy is not simply rule by majority opinion. The majority needs to work with minority so that government may function to represent the general view.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Rule by majority does not become rule by majority community in terms of religion or race or linguistic groups, etc.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Democracy remains democracy so long as every citizen has a chance of being in majority at some point of time. No individual should be debarred from participating in a democracy on the basis of religion, caste, community, creed and other such factors.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 25.
           <br/>
           How has foreign trade been integrating markets of different countries? Explain with examples. [5 × 1 = 5]
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           How do we feel the impact of globalization on our daily life? Explain with examples. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Foreign trade creates opportunities for producers to reach beyond domestic markets. Producers can compete in markets located in other countries of the world. Similarly, for the buyers, import of goods from another country leads to expanding choice of goods beyond what is domestically produced. Buyers can thus choose from a wide range of products to suit their individual tastes.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) With the opening of trade, goods travel from one market to another. Choice of goods ; in the market rises. Prices of similar goods in two markets tend to become equal, and producers in the two countries now closely compete against each other even though they are separated by thousands of miles. Foreign trade, thus, results in connecting the markets or integration of markets in different countries.
           <br/>
           For example, There are endless number of footwear brands available in the Indian market. A consumer who is aware of international trends can choose between a local brand like Bata, Lakhani and international brands like Adidas, Nike, Reebok etc.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Globalization has had both a positive as well as a negative effect:
           <br/>
           1. People with education, skill and wealth have benefitted by globalization.
           <br/>
           (i) Greater competition among producers (both local and foreign) has been advan-tageous to consumers, particularly the well-off section. Rich people enjoy improved quality at lower prices for several products and enjoy a higher standard of living.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) MNCs have increased their investments in India over the past 20 years in industries such as cell phones, automobiles, electronics, soft drinks, fast food and services such as banking.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) New jobs have been created in all these industries and services.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) Top Indian companies have benefitted from the increased competition. They have invested in newer technology and production methods.
          </p>
<p>
           (v) Some Indian companies have gained from successful collaborations with foreign companies. Globalization has enabled some companies to emerge as multinationals.
          </p>
<p>
           2. However, globalization has not been uniform among producers and workers.
           <br/>
           (i) Globalization has posed a major challenge for a large number of small producers and workers. Small manufacturers have been hit hard due to competition causing many industrial units to shut down, rendering many workers jobless in small industries. (The small industries in India employ 20 million workers.)
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Due to the pressure of competition, most employers do not employ workers on a permanent basis; to avoid paying for the whole year.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Workers’ jobs are not secure any more, wages are low and they are forced to work overtime to earn adequate money.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) In order to cut costs of products for the benefit of MNCs, employers in industries such as garment exports, pay very low wages to workers. Hence, there is a need for ‘fair globalization’ which will ensure that the benefits of globalization are shared better in a more equitable manner.
          </p>
<p>
