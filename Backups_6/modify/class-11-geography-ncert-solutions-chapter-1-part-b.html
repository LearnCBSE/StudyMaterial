           Answer:
           <br/>
           (b) 82°30′ E.
          </p>
<p>
           2. Answer the following questions in about 30 words.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           Question 2(i).
           <br/>
           Does India need to have more than one standard time? If yes, why do you think so?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Yes, I think India needs to have more than one standard time.
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            There is time variation of 2 hours between Easternmost and the Westernmost parts of our country. The sun rises two hours earlier in Arunachal Pradesh as compared to Gujarat.
           </li>
<li>
            This is because the earth is tilted and also it rotates in east to west direction. So while rotation, the Eastern parts of the world experiences the sun rays earlier as compared to the western parts of the world.
           </li>
<li>
            Many countries like USA, Canada and Russia have more than one standard time because their longitudinal extent is large. India’s longitudinal extent is also 30° approximately. Therefore, it is advisable to use more than one standard time.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Question 2(ii).
           <br/>
           What are the implications of India having a long coastline?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The total length of Coastline is 7,516.6 km.
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            India is a southward extension of the Asian continent. The trans Indian Ocean routes which connect the countries of Europe in the west and the countries of East Asia provide a strategic central location to India.
           </li>
<li>
            The Deccan Peninsular protrudes into the Indian Ocean, thus helping India to establish close contact with west Asia, Africa and Europe from the Western coast and with Southeast Asia and East Asia from the Eastern coast.
           </li>
<li>
            No other country has a long coastline on the Indian Ocean as India has and indeed, it is India’s eminent position in the Indian Ocean which justifies the naming of an Ocean after it.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Question 2(iii).
           <br/>
           How is the latitudinal spread of India advantageous to her?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           There are three major advantages of latitudinal extent-
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<ol>
<li>
            Tropic of cancer (23 1/2°.) – It divides India into 2 parts. Southern part is in the tropical zone while northern part is in the temperate zone. Therefore biodiversity in India is exceptional.
           </li>
<li>
            It also brings climatic diversity in India which has many advantages.
           </li>
<li>
            As we move from Kannyakumari to Jammu and Kashmir duration of day and night decreases by more than 4 1/2 hours.
           </li>
<li>
            We have places of all climates. It makes India a subcontinent.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Question 2(iv).
           <br/>
           While the sun rises earlier in the east, say Nagaland and also sets earlier, how do the watches at Kohima and New Delhi show the same time?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           While the sun rises earlier in the east, say Nagaland and also sets earlier but the watches at Kohima and New Delhi show the same time because India follows one standard time all over its land. It is time shown at standard meridian of India. There is a general understanding among the countries of the world to select the Standard Meridian in multiples of 7° 30′ of longitude. Hence , 82°30′ E is chosen as the Standard Meridian of India and the time along the Standard Meridian of India passing through Mirzapur is taken as the Standard Time for the whole country.

           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Why is there a time variation of 2 hours between the easternmost and westernmost part of the country?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Longitudinal extent of India is 68°7′ to 97°25′ E-(2-9°). There is time variation of 2 hours between easternmost and the westernmost parts of our country. The sun rises two hours earlier in Arunachal Pradesh as compared to Gujarat. This is because the earth is tilted and also it rotates in east to west direction. So while rotation, the eastern parts of the world experiences the sun rays earlier as compared to the western parts of the world.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           A gulf can be described as a large body of water that is almost encircled by land except for a small mouth that is opened out to the ocean. While it can be described as a large bay, the Gulf of Mexico is considered to be the largest in the world consisting of a total surface area of about 1,554,000 square kilometres. It is surrounded by the southern coast of the United States, Mexico and Cuba while also being comprised of several bays such as the Mobile Bay in Alabama and the Matagorda Bay in Texas. With typically less windy environment than open areas of the coast, gulfs have proved themselves as valuable town areas as they provide easy access to the sea while being protected as well.

           <br/>
           A strait can be defined as a naturally formed narrow strip of water between two continents, islands or two larger bodies of water. It is usually used for navigational purposes and is sometimes referred to as a channel when it is found between two land masses. Firth is another term often used to refer to straits, although sometimes varying in definition according to the context and the nature of the strait. Straits have served as a crucial part for shipping routes and wars have been fought over the control of straits due to their paramount importance. The strait of Gibraltar that separates northern Africa from the Rock of Gibraltar on the southernmost point of the Iberian Peninsula is perhaps the world’s most famous strait as this is the shipping route that was most utilized for all commercial purposes between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A bay is formed when the water from an ocean or a sea stops because of land mass. There is a small inlet passage before the water body becomes large, and then it gets surrounded by land on three sides, to be called a bay, depending upon the people who name it accordingly. Mostly these water bodies have been named as bays depending upon the perception of the people viewing it. If they think they are small, then the smaller ones have been called bays.

           Size of India has endowed India with unique physical diversity. Substantiate.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The size of India has endowed her with great physical diversity. The presence of lofty mountains in the north; large rivers such as Ganga, Brahmaputra, Mahanadi, Krishna, Godavari and Kaveri; green forested hills in the north-east and south India; and the vast sandy expanse of Marusthali is very impressive. It is bounded by the Himalayas in the north, Hindukush and Sulaiman ranges in the north-west, Purvachal hills in the north-east and by the large expanse of the Indian ocean in the south. The Himalayas, together with other ranges, have acted as a formidable physical barrier in the past. Except for a few mountain passes such as the Khyber, the Bolan, the Shipkila, the Nathula, the Bomdila, etc. it was difficult to cross it.

           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Differentiate the following:
           <br/>
           (a) Gulf and Strait
           <br/>
           (b) Gulf and Bay
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
<p>
           (a) Gulf and strait are two terms that are often discussed when it comes to geography. As gulfs and straits are both common features in seafaring. It is easy to confuse these two words. However, each feature has their own unique characteristics which in turn give them a unique purpose in the history of mankind.
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Meaning: A gulf is a large body of water almost encircled by land except for a small mouth that opens out to the sea. A strait is a strip of water that separates two lands or two large bodies of water.
           </li>
<li>
            Use: Straits are used for navigational purposes and have played an integral part when it comes to shipping routes. Gulfs are more useful for human settlements, as such areas provide easy access to the ocean while being well protected as well.
           </li>
<li>
            Association: Gulfs can be easily associated with inland bodies of water as well as the ocean. Straits are mostly discussed with regards to the ocean.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           (b) Difference between Gulf and Bay
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            A bay is not as enclosed by land masses as a gulf.
           </li>
<li>
            Gulf is formed because of erosion of the rocks as water makes inroads into adjoining land.
           </li>
<li>
            Gulfs take any form while bays are mostly oval or round shaped.

            Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) – India is 51/2 hours ahead of the Greenwich Mean Time and 821/2 E is choosen as the Standard Meridian of India.
           </li>
<li>
            Due to the longitudinal extent there is a time long of 2hours. Between Eastern and Western parts of India. The sun rises 2 hours earlier in Arunachal Pradesh as compared to Gujarat.

           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Why 82 30′ E is chosen as the Standard Meridian of our country?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           There is a general understanding among the countries of the world to select the Standard Meridian in multiples of 7 30′ of longitude. Hence, 82 30′ E is chosen as the Standard Meridian of India and the time along the Standard Meridian of India passing through Mirzapur is taken as the Standard Time for the whole country.

           Question 4.
           <br/>
           What are the implications of India having along coastline?
           <br/>

<ul>
<li>
            India is a southward extension of the Asian continent. The trans Indian Ocean
            <br/>
            routes which connect the countries of Europe in the west and the countries of East Asia provide a strategic central location to India.
           </li>
<li>
            The Deccan Peninsular protrudes into the Indian Ocean, thus helping India to establish close contact with west Asia, Africa and Europe from the Western
            <br/>
            coast and with Southeast Asia and East Asia from the Eastern coast.
           </li>
<li>
            No other country has a long coastline on the Indian Ocean as India has and indeed, it is India’s eminent position in the Indian Ocean which justifies the naming of an Ocean after it.
