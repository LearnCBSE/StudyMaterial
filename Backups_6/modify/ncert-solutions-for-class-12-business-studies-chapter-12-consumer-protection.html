<br/>
<strong>
            Ans:
           </strong>
           A business can not survive without paying attention on protecting the consumers interest and adequately satisfying them. This is important because of the following reasons
           <br/>
           (i)
           <strong>
            Long Term Interest of Business

           feedback to prospective customers and thus help in increasing the customer base of business.
           <br/>
           (ii)
           <strong>
            Business uses Society’s Resources
           </strong>
<br/>

           <br/>
           (iii)
           <strong>
            Social Responsibility
           </strong>
<br/>
           A business has social resposibility towards various interest groups. Business organisations make money by selling goods and providing services to consumers. Thus, consumers form an important group among the many stakeholders of business and like other stakeholders, their interest has to be well taken care of.
           <br/>
           (iv)
           <strong>
            Moral Justification
           </strong>
<br/>
           The moral duty of any business is to take care of consumer’s interest and securing them from exploitation. Thus, a business must avoid insecure loss, exploitation and unfair trade practices like defective and unsafe products, adulteration, false and misleading advertising hoarding, black marketing etc.
           <br/>
           (v)
           <strong>
            Government Intervention
           </strong>
<br/>
           A business engaging in any form of exploitation time trade practices would invite government intervention or action. Thus, it is advisable that business organisation voluntarily resort to such practices, where the customers need and interests will be taken care of.

           <br/>

           <strong>
            Right to Seek Redressal

<strong>
            3. Explain the redressal mechanism available to consumers under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans:
           </strong>
           For the redressal of consumer grievances, the Consumer Protection Act provides for setting up of a three-tier enforcement machinery at the District, State and the National levels.
           <br/>
           (i)
           <strong>
            District Forum
           </strong>
           A complaint can be made to the appropriate District Forum when the value of goods or services, along with the compensation claimed, does not exceed ? 20 lakhs. In case the aggrieved party is not satisfied with the order of the District Forum, he can appeal before the State Commission within 30 days.
           <br/>
           (ii)
           <strong>
            State Commission
           </strong>
           A complaint can be made to the appropriate State Commission when the value of the goods or services, along with the compensation claimed, exceeds ? 20 lakhs but does not exceed Rs 1 crore. The appeals against the orders of District Forum can also be filed before the State Commission. In case the party is not satisfied with the order of the State Commission, he can appeal before the National Commission within 30 days of the passing of the order by State Commission.
           <br/>
           (iii)

            National Commission
           </strong>
           A complaint can be made to the National Commission when the value of the goods or services, along with the compensation claimed exceeds Rs 1 crore. The appeals against the orders of a State Commission can also be filed before the National Commission. An order passed by the National Commission in a matter of its original justification is appealable before the supreme court. This means that only those appeals, where the value of goods + services in question, along with the compensation claimed, exceeded Rs. 1 crore and where the aggrieved party was not satisfied with the order of the National Commission, can be taken to the Supreme Court of India.

<h3>
<strong>
            Case Problem
           </strong>
</h3>
<p>
           Now, filing complaint is just, a click away. Filing a complaint in a consumer court’s going to get a lot easier by the end of this year, virtually. No matter which part of the country you’re in, it’s going to happen at the click of a mouse.
           <br/>
           The project, called Confonet (Computerisation and Computer Networking of Consumer Fora), is being executed on a turnkey basis by the National Informatics Centre (NIC).
           <br/>
           “Online registration of complaints, the government hopes, will promote e-governance, transparency, efficiency and streamlining of consumer fora”, said an official in the consumer affairs ministry. Of Rs 48.64 Crore set aside for the project, the government has released ^ 30.56 crore so far, the official added.
           <br/>
           “Besides software development and testing, networking and project implementation, integration and site preparation, it will include purchase of hardware for all the 583 District fora, 35 state commissions and the National Commission”, the official said.
           <br/>
           At present, computer systems and system software have been delivered to 25 state commissions and 300 District fora — never mind (he fact that it’s sometimes a long wait before the hardware is finally unpacked and set up in some of the districts. Meanwhile, training of staff, sometimes in the classroom and sometimes through e-learning sessions, are in full swing.
           <br/>
           “But just setting up an online complaint filing system won’t ensure a strong consumer protection movement in the country — for that we’re working on GenNext and the best way to do that is to go to schools”, the official said.
           <br/>
           The government is, therefore, involving school children to form consumer clubs, so as to involve them in various consumer welfare activities.
           <br/>
           Part of the funding for running the club is to come from various state governments, with an equally matching grant from the Centre. However, a number of state governments are yet to sanction the fund — some of these include Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala.

           . What new measure is the ministry of consumer affairs taking to make filing a complaint easy?
           <br/>
<strong>
            Ans:
           </strong>
           Online registration of complaints has been initiated by the ministry of consumer affairs to make filing of complaint easy.
          </p>

           </strong>
           . What roll can you as a student play to contribute to the cause of consumer protection?
           <br/>
<strong>
            Ans:
           </strong>
           A student can play an active role in bringing out an awareness campaign on ‘Consumer Protection’.
           <br/>
           (i) Special assemblies can organised to show the display of consumer rights and responsibilities.
           <br/>
           (ii) When school organises any exhibition the commerce students can put a stall and give demonstration on responsibilities of a consumer.
           <br/>
           (iii) The Biology and Chemistry laboratories can be used for testing adulterated goods, (e.g., milk, paneer, spices etc).
           <br/>
           (iv) Essay writing competitions, debate competition and quiz can be organised to promote the awareness on consumer protection.
           <br/>
           (v) Encourage students to boycott goods/eatables which are adulterated or defective in school canteen.
           <br/>
           (vi) To set up voluntary complaint centre for consumer guidance and counseling.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            3
           </strong>
           . What scenario of consumer protection do you foresee j when the measures proposed in the above news report are implemented?
           <br/>
<strong>
            Ans:
           </strong>
           With the implementation of online registration, educated and technology friendly consumer will gain but in my opinion the unaware, ignorant and simple consumers who still are far away from e-governance would stand in need of the 3 forums working efficiently and effectively. Thus both the systems should work parallel, hand in hand to protect the interests of different types of consumers.
