</p>
<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below: [12]
           <br/>
           1. Maharana Pratap ruled over Mewar only for 25 years. However, he accomplished so much grandeur during his reign that his glory surpassed the boundaries of countries and time turning him into an immortal personality. He along with his kingdom became a synonym for valour, sacrifice and patriotism. Mewar had been a leading Rajput kingdom even before Maharana Pratap occupied the throne. Kings of Mewar, with the cooperation of their nobles and subjects, had established such traditions in the kingdom, as augmented their magnificence despite the hurdles of having a smaller area under their command and less population. There did come a few thorny occasions when the flag of the kingdom seemed sliding down. Their flag once again heaved high in the sky, thanks to the gallantry and brilliance of the people of Mewar.
          </p>
<p>
           2. The destiny of Mewar was good in the sense that barring a few kings, most of the rulers were competent and patriotic. This glorious tradition of the kingdom almost continued for 1500 years since its establishment, right from the reign of Bappa Rawal. In fact, only 60 years before Maharana Pratap, Rana Sanga drove the kingdom to the pinnacle of fame. His reputation went beyond Rajasthan and reached Delhi. Two generations before him, Rana Kumbha had given a new stature to the kingdom through victories and developmental work. During his reign, literature and art also progressed extraordinarily. Rana himself was inclined towards writing and his works are read with reverence even today. The ambience of his kingdom was conducive to the creation of high quality work of art and literature. These accomplishments were the outcome of a long standing tradition sustained by several generations.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           3. The lives of the people of Mewar must have been peaceful and prosperous during the long span of time; otherwise such extraordinary accomplishment in these fields would not have been possible. This is reflected in their art and literature as well as their loving nature. They compensate for lack of admirable physique by their firm but pleasant nature. The ambience of Mewar remains lovely thanks to the cheerful and liberal character of its people.
          </p>
<p>
           4. One may observe astonishing pieces of workmanship not only in the forts and palaces of Mewar but also in public utility buildings. Ruins of many structures which are still standing tall in their grandeur are testimony to the fact that Mewar was not only the land of the brave but also a seat of art and culture. Amidst aggression and bloodshed, literature and art flourished and creative pursuits of literature and artists did not suffer. Imagine, how glorious the period must have been when the Vijaya Stambha which is the sample of our great ancient architecture even today, was constructed. In the same fort, Kirti Stambha is standing high, reflecting how liberal the then administration was which allowed people from other communities and kingdoms to come and carry out construction work. It is useless to indulge in the debate whether the Vijay Stambha was constructed first or the Kirti Stambha. The fact is that both the capitals are standing side by side and reveal the proximity between the king and the subjects of Mewar.
          </p>
<p>
           5. The cycle of time does not remain the same. Where the reign of Rana Sanga was crucial in raising the kingdom to the acme of glory, it also proved to be his nemesis. History took a turn the fortune of Mewar—the land of the brave, started waning. Rana tried to save the day with his acumen which was running against the stream and the glorious traditions for some time.

</div>
<p>
           (h) During Rana Kumbha’s reign, literature and art progressed extraordinarily.

Along with mining wars, the ruler patronized art.
          </p>
<p>
           (k) (i) astonishing (ii) testimony
          </p>
<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below : [10]
           <br/>
           1. To ensure its perpetuity, the ground is well held by the panther both in space and in time. It enjoys a much wider distribution over the globe than its bigger cousins and procreates sufficiently profusely to ensure its continuity for all time to come.
          </p>
<p>
           2. There seems to be no particular breeding season of the panther, although its sawing and caterwauling is more frequently heard during winter and summer. The gestation period is about ninety to hundred days (Whipsnade, ninety-two days). The litter normally consists of four cubs, rarely five. Of these, generally two survive and not more than one reaches maturity. I have never come across more than two cubs at the heels of the mother. Likewise, graziers in the forest have generally found only two cubs hidden away among rocks, hollows of trees, and other impossible places.
          </p>
<p>
           3. Panther cubs are generally in evidence in March. They are bom blind. This is a provision of Nature against their drifting away from the place of safety in which they are lodged by their mother, and exposing themselves to the danger of their being devoured by hyenas, jackals, and other predators. They generally open their eyes in about three to four weeks.
          </p>
<p>
           4. The mother alone rears its cubs in seclusion. It keeps them out of the reach of the impulsive and impatient male. As a matter of fact the mother separates from the male soon after mating and forgets all about their tumultuous union. The story that the male often looks in to find out how the mother is progressing with her cubs has no foundation except in what we wish it should do at least.
          </p>
<p>
           5. The mother carries its cubs about by holding them by the scruff of their necks, in its mouth. It trains them to stalk, and teaches them how to deliver the bite of death to the prey. The cubs learn to treat all and sundry with suspicion at their mother’s heels. Instinctively the cubs seek seclusion, keep to cover and protect their flanks by walking along the edge of the forest.
          </p>

           6. I have never had an opportunity to watch a mother panther train its cubs. But in Pilibhit forests, I once saw a tigress giving some lessons to its little ones. I was its kill at Mala. As the sunset, the tigress materialized in the twilight behind my machan. For about an hour, it scanned and surveyed the entire area looking and listening with the gravest concern. It even went to the road where my elephant was awaiting my signal. The mahout spotted it from a distance and drove the elephant away.
          </p>
<p>
           7. When darkness descended upon the scene and all was well and safe the tigress called its cubs by emitting a low haa-oon. The cubs, two in number and bigger than a full-grown cat, soon responded. They came trotting up to their mother and hurried straight to the kill in indecent haste. The mother spitted at them so furiously that they doubled back its heels immediately. Thereafter, the mother and its cubs sat under cover about 50 feet (15 m) away from the kill to watch, wait, look, and listen. After about half an hour’s patience and fidgetless vigil the mother seemed to say ‘paid for’. At this signal, the cubs cautiously advanced, covering their flanks, towards the kill. No longer did they make a beeline for it, as they had done before.
          </p>
<p>
           8. The mother sat watching its cubs eat, and mounted guard on them. She did not partake of the meal.

           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below: [8]
           <br/>
           People tend to amass possessions, sometimes without being aware of doing so. They can have a delightful surprise when they find something useful which they did not know they owned. Those who never have to change houses become indiscriminate collectors of what can only be described as clutter. They leave unwanted objects in drawers, cupboards and attics for years in the belief that they may one day need them. Old people also accumulate belongings for two other reasons, lack of physical and mental energy, and sentiment. Things owned for a long time are full of associations with the past, perhaps with the relatives who are dead, and so they gradually acquire a sentimental value.
          </p>
<p>
           Some things are collected deliberately in an attempt to avoid wastage. Among these are string and brown paper, kept by thrifty people when a parcel has been opened. Collecting small items can be a mania. A lady cuts out from newspapers sketches of model clothes that she would like to buy if she had money. As she is not rich, the chances are that she will never be able to afford such purchases. It is a harmless habit, but it litters up her desk.
          </p>
<p>
           Collecting as a serious hobby is quite different and has many advantages. It provides relaxation for leisure hours, as just looking at one’s treasure is always a joy. One doesn’t have to go out for amusement as the collection is housed at home. Whatever it consists of- stamps, records, first editions of books, china-there is always something to do in connection with it; from finding the right place for the latest addition to verifying facts in reference books. This hobby educates one not only in the chosen subject but also in general matters which have some bearing on it.
          </p>
<p>
           There are other benefits also. One gets to meet like-minded collectors to get advice, compare notes, exchange articles, to show off one’s latest finds, etc.; so, one’s circle of friends grows. Soon the hobby leads to travelling, perhaps a meeting in another town, possibly a trip abroad in search of a rare specimen, for collectors are not confined to one country. Over the years, one may well become an authority on one’s hobby and will probably be asked to give informal talks to little gatherings and then, if successful, to larger audiences.
           <br/>
           (a) On the basis of your understanding of the above passage make notes on it, using headings and subheadings. Use recognizable abbreviations (wherever necessary – minimum four) and a format you consider suitable. Also supply an appropriate title to it. [5]
           <br/>

           (b) Summary:
           <br/>
           People sometimes collect things due to various reasons which may be related to their need, lack of energy or sentimental values. Sometimes collection may be done to avoid wastage which later becomes a mania. But it has many advantages too; it relaxes, amuses and educates. It has additional benefits where one may meet like-minded collectors to get advice, compare notes, exchange articles, to show off one’s latest findings, etc. As a result, their friend circle grows bigger. In fact, hobby further leads to travelling.

           Along with air and water pollution, our cities are also under an attack of noise pollution. Marriage processions, DJs during wedding receptions, loud music from neighbourhood flats etc. are all sources of noise which is not good for the old, the ailing and students. Write a letter in 120-150 words to the editor of a local newspaper describing the problem and making a request to the concerned authorities to solve it. You are Karuna/Karan, M-114, Mall Road, Delhi.

           Subject: Time to become aware of the hazards of noise pollution
           <br/>
           Dear Sir,
           <br/>
           Through the esteemed columns of your prestigious newspaper, I, a resident of New Delhi, want to bring forth the issue of increasing noise pollution to the notice of the general public and concerned authorities. In the metro cities, there has been a tremendous increase in the levels of noise pollution. It’s not only the shrieking horns and roars of vehicles but also marriage processions, loud DJ’s, aircraft and machines in industrial areas which cause a lot of noise pollution.
          </p>
<p>
           The consequences are extremely hazardous. They lead to increasing cases of deafness, insomnia, palpitation of heart, mental fatigue, etc. Among the sufferers are the small babies and old people who can’t sleep properly, there are patients who can’t take rest and students who can’t study. Then there are ‘Jagrans’ that force the public to keep awake the whole night. The problem further adds to the fact that noise control laws are neither followed properly nor implemented completely. The culprits bribe the police and other officials and get away easily.
          </p>
<p>
           So, I think that law alone is not sufficient until and unless we citizens take an oath to make the city noise-free and educate the people about its ill effects. Above all, everybody has a right to enjoy a noiseless, peaceful sleep at night. Hope your newspaper will take initiative in this regard and relieve us from the menace of noise pollution.

           Dear Sir,
           <br/>
           I am writing this letter to bring to your kind notice, the problem of increasing cases of road rage. Day by day, it is becoming a serious problem which should be sorted out as quickly as possible. We often come across many incidents like minor scratch, a little push or a small brushing past, leading to scuffles which escalate quickly ana sometimes even result in death. Everyday, there are many fatal accidents, happening and the number of hit and run cases are also rising. In Delhi alone, 532 people died in road accidents in the year 2014. It is observed that people are losing patience and tolerance due to their modem lifestyle. They begin to fight over minor issues. The feeling of ignorance, irresponsibility, lawlessness and indifference is prevailing. Everybody is taking undue advantage of the freedom provided to them by the democracy. Now, it’s high time to realize the need of the hour. I hope the concerned authorities would realize the gravity of the situation and put a check to these people and their activities either by imposing penalties or fines.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           BRAIN DRAIN IS NOT A BANE FOR A DEVELOPING COUNTRY LIKE INDIA’
           <br/>
           Good morning, respected judges and the esteemed audience, I would like to speak against the motion-‘Brain Drain is not a bane for a developing country like India’.
          </p>
<p>
           Brain Drain is a major problem of India that has been harmful to the country. Brain drain means the intelligent minds that do not get desirable jobs or recognition in their own country thus they migrate to other countries for better prospective where they are provided with favorable working conditions. They prove their intelligence there and are recognized throughout the world. They also become the pride of the country. Every year a large number of people go abroad either for acquiring higher studies or getting good jobs. It is because their worth and intelligence is not acknowledged aptly in the country. Sometimes, the most brilliant people also leave India and prefer to stay in a well-developed country like America, England, Canada, etc. This is the most common thing in India as compared to other countries as the companies over here fail to provide necessary working conditions and acceptable salaries to their own countrymen.
          </p>
<p>
           But the question arises what if they show their worth in their own country? How can they be stopped from migrating or persuaded to return to India?
          </p>
<p>
           It is a matter of serious concern for the government of India because it is a complete loss for India. The professional training that the students receive in India and for which the government spends lakhs of rupees, goes waste; plus it is a gain for receiving countries. They can be attracted to India if the conditions here are altered to their liking; if the merit and talent is given due consideration. Therefore, sincere efforts are required to bring them back by offering jobs according to their caliber, so as to make the country more efficient in all fields.

           ‘DISCIPLINE SHAPES THE FUTURE OF A STUDENT’
           <br/>
           Good Morning, honorable Principal, respected Teachers and my dear friends. I am Karuna, student of class XII of your school. It is a great opportunity for me to share my views in today’s assembly, on the topic, ‘Discipline shapes the future of a student’.
          </p>
<p>
           The students of today are the leaders of tomorrow. They are the backbone of the society. They are going to be the future leaders, administrators and nation shapers. Student life is the time when their character is formed and takes shape. But .nowadays, schools and colleges have become places of complete indiscipline. Whether it is the morning assembly, annual function, sports meet or examinations, one can see complete indiscipline in it. Man is a social being and he lives and dies in a society. So, he has to follow the rules of the society for which he has to discipline himself and this begins from the school itself.
          </p>
<p>
           Aristotle said,” Discipline is obedience to rules formed by the society for the good of all”. Without disciplines, one cannot acquire knowledge and as the schools and colleges are abodes of learning, it is required much over there. Students cannot gain much without discipline and the result can never be good. Thus, it is clear that the need of discipline is much required in the student life. Indiscipline leads to failure but discipline paves the road of success.

           Question 7.
           <br/>
           Education has always been a noble profession. Our ancestors received their learning at gurukuls and ashrams.

Today, education has been totally commercialized. Whether its school or college, students have to rush to coaching classes and parents have to shell out a lot of money on them. They don’t rely on classroom teaching. On the other hand, parents’ expectations for their children have increased. They want them to secure highest marks so as to get the highest paid jobs. They want them to become doctors, administrative officers, engineers, etc. For this, they send their children to the most reputed schools; still they are not satisfied with their performance. They want their child to get some extra knowledge to excel in others fields. Thus, craze the for coaching classes has increased.
          </p>
<p>
           Another reason for joining the coaching classes is the inferiority complex which children face when they do not go for extra coaching. Although, these so called coaching classes are just like school classes because they too follow group teaching method is used but still parents as well as children think them to be far superior to classroom teaching. They should realize that these coaching classes are no better than a money-making business. The students must pay attention in class and must concentrate more on self-study in order to be successful.

           ROLE OF STUDENTS IN ERADICATING ILLITERACY
           <br/>
           By Karuna/Karan
           <br/>
           Youth plays a very important role in building the nation. With the increase in population, the responsibilities of students have also increased. They are the pivot on which the development of any nation depends. We know that India is a land of villages and most of its population is illiterate, In most of the villages, there are no schools or teaching facilities.
          </p>
<p>
           Thus, villagers don’t get any opportunity to learn. Poverty and ignorance have deprived them and the weaker section from becoming literate. Therefore, it becomes the duty of the youth to render their services to them by teaching them.They can share their valuable advice and guidance to educate them. We know that education helps in economic, social, spiritual and mental development. It broadens ones outlook towards society. Being illiterate or uneducated, is like a curse. Students can help these people by organizing evening classes and by adopting the motto’ each one, teach one’. Out of their twenty-four hours, the students can spare at least one hour for the unprivileged people. They can spread awareness among the illiterates regarding the hazards of overpopulation and recommend the need of having a small family. Many NGOs and governmental agencies are there to assist these youths in this regard. They can be encouraged to do so by giving them the incentive of gaining additional marks or extra grades.
          </p>
<p>
           Youth, therefore, can play a major role in making the country progressive and prosperous by bringing complete change in the attitude and thinking of the illiterate by educating them. So, let’s join hands to eradicate illiteracy from our country.

           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Answer any four of the following questions in 30-40 words each: [3 × 4 = 12]
           <br/>
           (a) What does the reference to chappals in ‘Lost Spring’ tell us about the economic condition of the rag pickers?
           <br/>
           (b) What do we learn about the crofter’s nature from the story, ‘The Rattrap’?
           <br/>
           (c) How is ‘Shakespeare wicked and the map a bad example’ for the children of the school in a slum?
           <br/>
           (d) What picture of male chauvinism (tyranny) do we find in the poem, ‘Aunt Jennifer’s Tigers’?
           <br/>
           (e) How did the Governor, Oxford Prison describe Evans to the Secretary, Examination Board?
           <br/>
           (f) At the dining table why did Zitkala-Sa begin to cry when others started eating?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The reference to chappals in ‘Lost Spring’ tells about the miserable life of the rag pickers settled in Seemapuri. Most of the impoverished children busy in rag-picking, were not wearing footwear. The boys were barefeet as if it was a tradition to remain barefeet. It had become their habit not to wear chappals. But according to the writer-it was their excuse to conceal their poverty.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) The crofter was a lonely old man who neither had a wife a child. He wanted someone to talk to, therefore, he allowed the peddler to spend the night at his house. He not only gave him shelter, but also gave him food to eat and tobacco to smoke. He started a conversation with him and told him everything about himself and his earnings.
          </p>
<p>
           (c) The portrait of Shakespeare and the world map in the classroom of the slum children is far from the actual condition of the classroom. Shakespeare is the synonym of knowledge and excellence but the children of the slum school have no meaning for that. The map exhibits the world with all its bounties, whereas, for these children there is no world beyond poverty and hunger. Thus, Shakespeare is wicked and the map a bad example.
          </p>
<p>
           (d) In the poem ‘Aunt Jennifer’s Tigers’, we find the picture of a woman oppressed by the male chauvinism. She needs freedom from her burdensome husband, whose ring on her finger is like a handcuff which has snatched all her freedom and happiness. She has a lot of constraints in her life because of her dominating husband and from whom she wants to get free.
          </p>
<p>
           (e) The Governor of the Oxford Prison made a call to the Secretary of Examination Board telling him that a prisoner named Evans wanted to take the O-level examination in German. He told him that Evans is not a violent person but he is a congenital Kleptomaniac. The Governor then requested the Secretary to see whether the arrangements could be made in the prison itself.
          </p>
<p>
           (f) At the dining table, Zitkala-Sa heard a man’s voice and as she looked around to see him, she caught the eyes of a pale-faced woman upon her. She was so keenly watched by the strange woman. Moreover she wasn’t used to eating by fomula. So, as the third bell rang and everybody started eating, Zitkala began to cry as she could do nothing at that time and felt out of place.

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Answer the following question in 120-150 words: [6]
           <br/>
           Every teenager has a hero/heroine to admire. So many times they become role models for them. What is wrong if Sophie fantasizes about Danny Casey and is ambitious in life?
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Our native language is a part of our culture and we are proud of it. How does the presence of village elders in the classroom and M. Hamel’s last lesson show their love for French?
           <br/>
           Answers:
           <br/>
           It is a natural thing for teenagers to fantasize and dream. They don’t have much liabilities and burden at this stage of life so they are free to dream which is sometimes impractical and non-realistic. It is a part of their lives but sometimes these dreams have disadvantages.
          </p>
<p>
           In the story ‘Going Places’, the author has described the feelings and dreams of such a girl. Sophie, who was a school going teenager, was a day dreamer who fantasized about her future life with Danny Casey, an acid football player from Ireland. She dreamt of having met him twice in the arcade. For her, he was the hero to be worshipped. Then, she thought of owning a boutique. She was blind to the bitter truth of life. She dreamt of an imaginary life, full of beautiful things. She also dreamt of becoming an actress as there was a lot of money and fame in that profession. She wanted to be a fashion designer too. It can be said that she wanted to lead a lavish and grand life which was not possible. Her dreams were unrealistic in the sense that ultimately she would have to work in a biscuit factory. Thus, we can say that she wanted to achieve the things which were quite impossible but there’s nothing wrong in fantasizing.

           That Sunday morning, everything was quite normal. Franz’s classmates and teacher were already in the class but there was no sound of opening and closing of desks. Even unison repetition of lessons and rapping of teacher’s great ruler was absent. It was all due to the order from Berlin that from then onwards, only German would be taught in the schools of Alsace and Lorraine instead of French. Then only the people realized how precious their language was to them. That day, all the villagers occupied the back benches in the classroom to attend the last French lesson and to mark the respect for their French teacher, Mr. M. Hamel, who devoted his selfless service to the society. They felt very sad. They also regretted not learning French properly.
          </p>
<p>
           Franz was shocked to hear this news and Hamel’s words were like thunderclaps to him. He was so sorry French before and for having wasted his time. His books suddenly became his friends. Even Mr. Hamel talked a lot about the French language. According to him, it was the most beautiful language in the world. It was the most logical one too. He asked his students never to forget this language.

           Question 11.

           Answer the following question in 120-150 words: [6]
           <br/>
           Both Derry and Lamb are victims of physical impairment, but much more painful for them is the feeling of loneliness. Comment.

           How did Jack end the Roger Skunk story? How and why did Jo want to change it?
           <br/>
           Answers:
           <br/>
           A disabled or a handicapped person is considered to be an outcaste. People sympathize with them but do not accompany them. They are excluded from the society. The feeling of loneliness and alienation is much more troublesome than the pain which disabled people experience due to their physical impairment. This is very well revealed in the story, ‘On the face of it’, where the character, Derry has an acid burnt face and people often sympathized with him but it was not a heart-felt one. This resulted in his pessimistic approach towards life and people. Derry had no association with the outer world till he met Mr. Lamb who had. Mr. Lamb’s attitude and outlook towards people and life uplifted him. He learnt to live a respectful life.
          </p>
<p>
           Mr. Lamb inspired him to face the world in spite of his own disability. Mr. Lamb successfully infused in him the courage and self-determination. He advised him to ignore the comments made by people on his physical impairment and enjoy the beauty of life and nature. Although, the loneliness of Derry dominates the play but there are evident traces of Mr. Lamb’s loneliness also. The old man had no one to be with. He spent his day in the sun, reading books. By the end of the first scene, it becomes clearer that he is lonely when he mutters that no one comes back to him after meeting him for the first time.

           Jack used to tell his little daughter, Jo, bedtime stories. When she grew older, she began to ask questions to her father. Once her father told her a story of a little animal called Roger Skunk who smelled awfully bad. He, therefore, met with a wizard who solved his problem with a magical wand and made him smell like roses. But, Skunk’s mother did not like it and took him back to the wizard to make him smell originally bad once again. This ending was not acceptable to Jo as she wanted the story to have another end in which the wizard should hit the mommy by his magic wand and leave Roger skunk emitting the pleasant smell of roses. Jo thought that Roger was the hero of the story so he must not look ugly or stinky. Jo’s perspective on life was different from her father’s. She wanted to change the end of the story to assert her views on her father. She had her own ideals and views which she wanted to be pursued by her father.

           <br/>
           Dear Sir,
           <br/>
           Through the columns of your esteemed daily, I, Karuna/Karan would like to emphasis on the importance of medical tourism in India. As we know that India is the most popular tourist place people from all over the world come to India for their treatment by the most experienced and world class physicians. The medical facilities available in the high- end hospitals of India are excellent. They are equipped with the latest technologies and the doctors are super-specialized in their respective fields. With the advent of globalization, the world has shrunk.
          </p>
<p>
           The concept of medical tourism was devised to help global citizens to enjoy their tourist sojourns while being cost effective world-class medical quality. Over the last decade, India has emerged as the preferred destination for medical tourism. The city of Chennai has been termed as ’India’s health capital’. India’s medical tourism sector is expected to experience an annual growth rate of 30% making it a $2 Billion industry. Therefore, medical tourism should also be promoted by the government along with other tourist sectors.
           <br/>
           Yours Sincerely

           December, 20XX, I purchased a flat from PQR Builders in ‘Ashiana Apartments’. The flat is on the first floor of D-Wing in sector 55, Noida. Initially, when the flat was shown to us, it was in excellent condition with walls, doors, ceiling perfectly painted and well-furnished. The kitchen and bathroom were very well-equipped with attractive fittings, seeing it we were tempted to buy it immediately.
          </p>
<p>
           But now, I’m very hurt to inform you that the flat which I purchased only two months before is in a very poor condition and so I, hereby, lodge a complaint against the negligence and dereliction on your part. Within a period of two months I’m facing a lot of problems like seepage in the walls and ceilings, wall paint peeling off, leaking of sanitary fittings, lift getting stalled, etc. Even the service men do not turn up on time to rectify the problems.
          </p>
<p>
           Please ask your mechanic and service men to check the fittings and do the required repair work.
           <br/>
           Yours faithfully

           ‘IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT’
           <br/>
           By Karuna/Karan
           <br/>
           Recently, I heard that traffic police has started a new drive against the pollution causing vehicles. Traffic police is stationed at the important intersections. Each and every vehicle is checked for ‘No Pollution’ certificates and they are fined ₹. 500 for the lapse. But, what is the use of all this and how long could it go because people find too many excuses for their negligence. Next, from every house, a minimum of two to three vehicles are used by the people for going to their working places. Sometimes, they are stuck with their vehicles for long hours due to heavy traffic jams. So, it would be far better if the government provides public transport facilities. It would create a lot of convenience for the public and daily commuters. It has many social, economic and environmental benefits.
          </p>
<p>
           Social benefits of using public transport are multifold. It helps in developing a sense of unity among people. They feel a Social connection with those who are traveling with them. It encourages people to have a healthy lifestyle if they walk to their station, stand or stop. Moreover, it is less stressful as it saves a lot of time and fuel. Then economic benefits include less expenditure of money on buying cars or spending money on their maintenance. Traveling by public transport is much cheaper than private transport. It also reduces pollution and road congestion thus, helping in environmental conservation.

           ‘GENDER DISCRIMINATION IN SOCIETY’
           <br/>
           By Karuna/Karan
           <br/>
           In India, attitude towards men and women has been discriminating since generations. Although, the Constitution of India has provided equal rights to men and women, gender disparity prevails. Nature has also divided human-beings into two equal halves and both are given equal responsibilities according to their capacity, thus, stating the rights to both of them. But we humans have shown discrimination which has now become a practice in society. The powerful become aggressors and the others face the aggression.
          </p>
<p>
           Usually women are considered to be weaker as compared to men and are considered to be uncapable of doing everything just because of their fragile appearance. Gender discrimination prevails in many homes, it is generally seen in families where there are sisters and brothers and where brothers are favored over sisters. Female infanticide and female foeticide are still common in many regions of the country. Sexual harassments, eve teasing, bride burning, woman trafficking, dowry deaths and many more evils are being perpetrated. Economically, females are less privileged as they do not have control on financial matters.
          </p>
<p>
           In the rural areas and villages the situation, is still bad. There has been no change in the social, economic and family status of the women. They are subjected to exploitation, domination and harassment by their male counterparts. But now it’s time that women should be empowered and encouraged so that the gap between men and women may be reduced.

           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Answer any four of the following questions in 30-40 words each: [3 × 4 = 12]
           <br/>
           (a) Why did the Crofter show the thirty kroner to the peddler?
           <br/>
           (b) What deep meaning did his experience at the YMCA swimming pool have for Douglas?
           <br/>
           (f) How Did Zitkala-Sa’s first day in the land of apples begin?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The crofter was very proud of his cow as it used to give enough milk to support him in his old age. When the peddler came to him, he felt so excited that he told him about the thirty kroner from the creamery as the payment of the previous month’s supply. He wanted to share his joy and moreover, he thought that peddler would not believe him, so he showed him the money to convince him.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) Experience at the YMCA swimming pool had a deep meaning for William Douglas. He had nearly escaped from drowning in the pool when he was sitting alone on the edge of the pool and a strong young man picked him up and tossed him into the pool. The experience had a deeper meaning for Douglas; he had experienced the fear of dying but at the same time, he learned to be confident and determined to overcome his fear.
          </p>
<p>
           (f) The first day in the land of apples was a bitter cold one. The snow covered the ground and the trees were bare. The large metallic sound of the bell crashed through Zitkala’s ears and then she heard an annoying clatter of shoes on bare floors. There was a harsh noise which was unknown to her. She found herself bound and her spirit strugged for its lost freedom.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           THE INTERNET CANNOT REPLACE A CLASSROOM TEACHER
           <br/>
           Good morning, respected judges and the esteemed audience! Today, I have the privilege of speaking in support of the motion: ‘The Internet cannot replace a classroom teacher’.
          </p>
<p>
           It is indeed a truth that the internet can solve a bulk of problems and provide all the necessary answers with illustrations to students but it cannot replace a classroom teacher as it is devoid of any kind of emotion which is required while teaching children. While teaching, teachers have to face all types of students with different mental abilities and they have to adjust their teaching pattern according to them. They motivate their students accordingly and help the weaker students to excel. There are some queries which cannot be solved by the internet but only a teacher can resolve it. The teacher understands the emotions and sentiments of the children; they realize the positive as well as the negative feelings of the students.
          </p>
<p>
           Teachers help us to remain alert and active in the classroom during teaching whereas a machine can never be. It’s not necessary that all the information provided by the internet is genuine. The question is that where has all the information or knowledge on the internet come from? It is us humans who have fed all of this information into the computers.
           <br/>
           In the end, 1 would like to say that a machine can never replace a living and breathing knowledgeable person, i.e, a teacher

           ‘WATER, A VALUABLE ASSET, CONSERVATION AT HOME AND AT SCHOOL’
           <br/>
           Honorable Principal, respected teachers and dear friends! Good Morning. I am Karuna/Karan, a student of class XII. It is a great opportunity for me to share my views on the topic ‘Water, a valuable asset, conservation at home and at school’ in today’s assembly.
          </p>
<p>
           Water scarcity today has become a big issue which if not dealt with in time, will turn out to be a hazard. With the increasing population, people are facing the problem of acute water shortage. People waste water in many ways which include washing cars, bathing animals, construction work, leaving taps running, etc. Apart from this, we can see leaking water pipes at many places which should be repaired at once. Children and adults should be taught not to leave the taps running while brushing the teeth or washing utensils and clothes. At home, water used for washing fruits and vegetables can be reused for gardening purpose.
          </p>
<p>
           To make people aware conservation of water, importance of rainwater harvesting and the method to recycle the water should be explained. There is no life without water. The public should be encouraged to improve water management practices that reduce the wastage of water and enhance the beneficial use of it. Some ancient methods of water conservation should also be practiced. In case the water is not used wisely by anyone, then a heavy fine should be imposed on them.

           IMPORTANCE OF YOGA TO STUDENTS
           <br/>
           By Karuna/Karan
           <br/>
           Today’s sedentary lifestyle has given invitation to many diseases as man has limited time to spare for his health. But practicing yoga helps to keep a person away from several health problems. It is the science that cures many serious diseases and helps the mind as well as body to remain sound. It helps in maintaining balance between mental and social status of a human being. With regular practice of yoga, we tend to become more sensitive to the kind of food our body demands. A few minutes of yoga helps in getting relief from stress. It helps detox the body and de-stress the mind. We all want to live in a peaceful atmosphere surrounded by nature, but we hardly realize that peace can be found within us. Yoga is the best way to calm a disturbed mind.
          </p>
<p>
           On the other hand, yoga postures massage organs and strengthen muscles; breathing techniques and meditation release stress and improves the immune system. Yoga and meditation work on keeping the mind happy and peaceful. When we feel drained out of energy, a few minutes spend on yoga provides the freshness and energy. It also helps in improving body posture. Today, students face many problems due to the burden of studies and they feel depressed but yoga acts as a stress buster for them. In many schools, yoga has been practiced on a daily basis as a part of the curriculum. It is gaining popularity not only in India but also in European countries.
           <br/>
           In the end, I would like to tell that yoga is a continuous process, so keep practicing!

           ADVERTISEMENTS AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION
           <br/>
           By Karuna/Karan
           <br/>
           Advertisements have become an inseparable part of our life. We can’t get away from them as they have surrounded us from all sides, when me go out of the house, we see various hoardings displaying one or the other things, when we switch on the television, they start attacking us in between the serials and movies. Even news channels are interrupted by them. In all, we can say that we can’t escape from the advertisements. But, there are certain things that can be said in favor of advertisements. The cost of production is lowered when the advertisers give money to newspapers, magazines, radio and television for mass marketing. Advertising is a way of delivering proper message to the customers. This way, we get the information as well as knowledge of various products.
          </p>
<p>
           Advertisements help in drawing customers to the business. It benefits the consumers also as there is a competition between the manufacturers and they try to sell their products at a lower cost than the others. Buyers, on the other hand, get wider choice to select the products according to their pocket and taste. They inform us about all the new products which are launched in the market. Without them, we would not be able to know about the new things and its benefits. Therefore, advertisements seek to generate increase in consumption of a product or a service by introducing it to the target consumers.

           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Answer any four of the following questions in 30-40 words each : [3 × 4 = 12]
           <br/>
           (a) All we have to fear is fear itself. When did Douglas learn this lesson?
           <br/>
           (b) Why did the iron master speak kindly to the peddler and invite him home?
           <br/>
           (e) What was his German teacher’s opinion of Evan’s proficiency in German?
           <br/>
           (f) According to Zitkala-Sa what does ‘eating by formula’ mean?
           <br/>
           Answer.
           <br/>
           (a) Douglas had a ’near to death’ experience of drowning and the fear of water took control . of his physical and mental strength. Finally, he decided to overcome this fear because of his interest in water activities like canoeing, swimming, fishing, boating etc. Ffe decided to get an instructor and learn to swim. He practiced an hour daily for five days a week. He learnt to exhale in water and inhale after coming out of it. He swam two miles across the Lake Wentworth.Thus, he had experienced both the sensation of dying and the terror it can produce. He was finally able to learn the lesson that ‘all we have to fear is the fear itself and overcome his fear of water.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) The iron master took the peddler for an old regimental comrade, Nils Olof. He considered the peddler as an old acquaintance who had fallen on evil days so he talked to him kindly and invited him to come home to help him.
          </p>
<p>
           (e) Evans’ German tutor started giving him tuitions for six months in night classes in the prison itself. Evans wanted to take the (O) level examination in German. When he was permitted by the Governor and the Board to take the examination, his tutor came to meet him the day before. He wished him good luck but said that he hardly had any ‘chance of getting through’. But Evans gave an ironical twist by saying that he would surprise everybody.
          </p>
<p>
           (f) On the first day in the land of apples, Zitkala noticed a very unusual thing. All the girls were lined up who were marching into the dining room. These were Indian girls, in stiff shoes and clinging dresses. When the first bell rang, all pupils pulled out their chairs from under the table. On the second bell, everybody sat down and picked up their knife and fork and began eating. She called this method ‘eating by formula.’
