           Question 4.
           <br/>
           During deficiency of oxygen in tissues of human beings pyruvic acid is converted into lactic acid in:
           <br/>
           (a) Cytoplasm
           <br/>
           (b) Chloroplast
           <br/>
           (c) Metochondria
           <br/>
           (d) Golgi body
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (b) Cytoplasm
           <br/>
           Explanation: The pyruvate produced during glycolysis usually enters the Kerb’s cycle as acetyl coenzyme A in the mitochondrial matrix, where it provides a reservoir of chemical energy (ATP, NADH and FADH
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           ). Pyruvic acid can be transformed to lactic acid as one of its potential fates in cellular respiration. Under stressful conditions, this often occurs in the cytoplasm of muscle tissue.

           (b) They have 4 to 8 valence electrons
           <br/>
           (c) They are brittle
           <br/>
           (d) They are capable of forming anions easily
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) They have one to three valence electrons
           <br/>
           Metal can easily give their electrons and form electro-positive ions. They have one to three valence electrons in their valence shell, They are not brittle and do not form anions.

           Question 8.
           <br/>
           Multiple fission is a reproductive strategy observed in certain organisms. Which of the following statements accurately describes multiple fission?
           <br/>
           (a) Multiple fission is a type of asexual reproduction where a single-parent organism divides into multiple offspring simultaneously.
           <br/>
           (b) Multiple fission is a type of sexual reproduction where two parent organisms fuse their genetic material to produce multiple offspring.
           <br/>
           (c) Multiple fission is a process where a single-celled organism divides into two identical daughter cells.
           <br/>
           (d) Multiple fission is a process where multiple cells fuse to form a larger, multicellular organism.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Multiple fission is a type of asexual reproduction where a single-parent organism divides into multiple offspring simultaneously.
           <br/>
           Explanation: Multiple fission is a reproductive strategy commonly observed in certain unicellular l organisms such as protists and some bacteria. This process involves the parent cell dividing into I multiple daughter cells, each of which develops into a new individual organism. The offspring produced through multiple fission are genetically identical to the parent organism. This reproductive strategy allows for rapid population growth and is advantageous in environments with favorable conditions for survival and growth.

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           A student connects an ammeter in series with a resistor in a circuit and observes that the ammeter reading is zero. Which of the following statements could explain this observation?
           <br/>
           (a) The resistor is not functioning properly.
           <br/>
           (b) The ammeter is faulty or not connected correctly.
           <br/>
           (c) There is no electric current flowing through the circuit.
           <br/>
           (d) The ammeter has reached its maximum reading and cannot measure higher currents.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (c) There is no electric current flowing through the circuit.
           <br/>
           Explanation: An ammeter is designed to measure the electric current passing through a circuit. When an ammeter reading is zero, it suggests that there is no electric current flowing through the circuit In this scenario, if the ammeter is correctly connected in series with a resistor and the reading is zero, it indicates that there is no current flowing through the circuit. Possible reasons for this inch an open switch, disconnected wires, or a power source that is not providing a voltage difference.

           Three men had one anesthetic block at X, Y, and Z respectively. One of the men can move his leg in response to a pinprick but does not feel it. Where is the anesthetic block in this man?
           <br/>
           (a) At X
           <br/>
           (b) At Y
           <br/>
           (c) At Z
           <br/>
           (d) No block
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (c) At Z
           <br/>
           Movement of the leg in response to a pinprick is a reflex action. Reflex action is controlled by the spinal cord and does not involve any thinking, hence brain does not play any role.

           Question 14.
           <br/>
           Which of the following statements is true about binary fission?
           <br/>
           (a) Some multicellular organisms also reproduce through binary fission.
           <br/>
           (b) Binary fission produces two new organisms.
           <br/>
           (c) Binary fission in Amoeba happens only in the vertical plane.
           <br/>
           (d) Binary fission in Leishmania can happen in any plane.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (b) Binary fission produces two new organisms.
           <br/>
           Explanation: Only unicellular organisms reproduce through binary fission. In binary fission, a unicellular organism (a cell) divides to form two unicellular organisms (two cells). Binary fission in Amoeba can happen in any plane. Binary fission in Leishmania happens in a definite orientation (plane) to the body because Leishmania has a somewhat organised structure.

<p>
           (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A.
           <br/>
           (b) Both A and R are true but R is not the correct explanation of A.
           <br/>
           (c) A is true but R is false.
           <br/>
           (d) A is false but R is true.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 17.
           <br/>
           Assertion (A): Acetic acid is more acidic than alcohol.
           <br/>
           Reason (R): The ion formed after the removal of a proton from acetic acid is less stable.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (c) Assertion is true, but Reason is false.
           <br/>
           Acetic acid is more acidic than alcohol because of the stability of ions formed after the removal of a proton.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 18.
           <br/>
           Assertion: Voltmeter is always connected in parallel across the circuit while measuring the potential difference.
           <br/>
           Reason: As the voltage in parallel circuits is measured to be the same.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A
           <br/>
           Explanation: The voltmeter is indeed always connected in parallel across the circuit while measuring the potential difference. This is because, in a parallel circuit, the voltage across each component is ? the same.
          </p>
<p>
           The Reason also provided correctly explains why the voltmeter is connected in parallel. By connecting the voltmeter in parallel, we ensure that it measures the same potential difference as the component we are interested in.

           (c) A is true, but R is false.
           <br/>
           Fertilization is a unique feature of flowers because the male gamete released by pollen is involved in fertilization. The male gamete unites with the egg and this forms a zygote. It is followed by embryo formation and not pollination.

           Question 21.
           <br/>
           Discuss the nature of covalent bonds.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Carbon has 4 electrons in its valence shell. To complete its octet, it either needs to gain 4 electrons or lose 4 electrons to the other atom. Both these processes are impossible. Therefore, the carbon atom achieves noble gas configuration by sharing 4 electrons with other atoms of itself or atoms of other elements. The bonds that are formed by sharing electrons are known as covalent bonds. In covalent bonding, both atoms share the valence electrons, i.e. the shared electrons belong to the valence shells of both atoms. CH

           Question 22.
           <br/>
           Do genetic combinations of the mother play a significant role in determining the sex of a new born?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           No, genetic combinations of the mother do not play a significant role in determining the sex of a new born; because mother has only one type of sex chromosomes i.e., X chromosomes, but a the father has two types of chromosomes X and Y chromosomes. So, all children will inherit the X chromosome from the mother and whether X or Y, bearing sperm from father fertilises the egg will determine the sex of new born.

           (ii) With the help of neat diagrams, explain the process of regeneration in Planaria.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In sexual reproduction, male and female gametes from two different individuals unite, leading to variation in offsprings due to the mixing up of genetic material whereas in case of asexual reproduction only single parent is involved and there is no formation of gametes. The ones that are produced sexually have been chances of survival due to mixing up of genetic material between the two different individuals, as the an increase in genetic variations in the offsprings which provides maximum chances for the survive species in the changing environment as well as under unfavourable conditions. This variation in space is also essential for evolution.

           As the blood passes, the waste products from the blood move into dialyzing fluid by diffusion, and the purified blood is pumped back into the patient’s body. The dialysis unit allows the blood to run along one side of a cellophane membrane and dialysis fluid in opposite directions. This is generally done to maintain the concentration gradient between the patient’s blood and the dialysis fluid. (2)

           <br/>
           (a) A 6V battery in series with 1 Ω and 2 Ω resistors,
           <br/>
           (b) A 4V battery in parallel with 12 Ω and 2 Ω resistors.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The circuit is shown in lift;
           <br/>
           Resistances are connected in series combination.
           <br/>
           Current in the circuit, I = \(\frac{V}{R_1+R_2}=\frac{6}{3}\) = 2 A
           <br/>
           ∴ Power used = I

           <br/>
           = 2 × 2 × 2
           <br/>
           = 8W (1)
           <br/>
           (b) The circuit is shown on right,
           <br/>
           In parallel combination, the potential across each resistor is the same and equal to the potential applied to the circuit.
           <br/>
           The potential across 2 Ω resistor, V = 4V
           <br/>
           Power used = \(\frac{V^2}{R}=\frac{4 \times 4}{2}\) = 8W

           Question 32.
           <br/>
           State the reason for the following:
           <br/>
           (i) Lemon is used for restoring the shine of tarnished copper vessels.
           <br/>
           (ii) Copper is used to make hot water tanks and not steel (an alloy of iron).
           <br/>
           (iii) Copper wires are used in electrical appliances.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) When copper vessels are exposed to moist air, they form a green coating of basic copper carbonate [CuCO
           <sub>
            3
           </sub>
           . CU(OH)
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           ]. The sour substance such as lemon juice contain acid. Lemon juice contains citric acid. This acid dissolve the coating of copper oxides or basic copper carbonate present on the surface of tarnished copper vessels and make them shining red-brown again.
           <br/>

<br/>
           (ii) Copper does not react with cold water, hot water, or steam. However, iron reacts with steam. If the hot water tanks are made of steel (an alloy of iron), then iron would react vigorously with the steam formed from hot water to corrode the tank due to the formation of iron oxide.
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 10 Science Set 3 with Solutions 18" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-101693" height="61" loading="lazy" src="https://www.cbsetuts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-Science-Set-3-with-Solutions-18.png" width="310"/>
<br/>
           Therefore, copper is used to make hot water tanks and not steel.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Copper metal has high melting and boiling point, good conductor of electricity and can be drawn into thin wires. This is the reason behind the use of copper metal to make electrical wires.

           Question 33.
           <br/>
           State whether an a-particle will experience any force in a magnetic field, if (α-particles are positively charged particles)
           <br/>
           (a) it is placed in the field at rest.
           <br/>
           (b) it moves in the magnetic field parallel to field lines.
           <br/>
           (c) it moves in the magnetic field perpendicular to field lines.
           <br/>
           Justify your answer in each case.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) No, it will not experience any force. A magnetic field exerts force on a moving charged particle only. (1)
           <br/>
           (b) No, it will not experience any force because the magnetic field exerts a force in a perpendicular direction to the motion of the particle. (1)
           <br/>
           (c) Yes, it will experience a force in a direction perpendicular to the direction of its motion and the direction of the magnetic field can be determined by Fleming’s left-hand rule. (1)

           Question 34.
           <br/>
           During the reaction of some metals with dilute hydrochloric acid, the following observations were made by a student:
           <br/>
           (i) Silver does not show any change.
           <br/>
           (ii) Some bubbles of a gas are seen when lead is reacted with the acid.
           <br/>
           (iii) The reaction of sodium is found to be highly explosive.
           <br/>
           (iv) The temperature of the reaction mixture rises when aluminium is added to the acid.
           <br/>
           Explain these observations giving appropriate reasons.

<br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Silver is covered with a thin layer of silver chloride, so it does not react with dilute hydrochloric acid.
           <br/>

           (a) Hypersecretion (more secretion) or hyposecretion (less secretion) of different hormones leads to various disorders In our body. The three common examples are
           <br/>
           (i) Goitre: Iodine acts as the necessary component for the synthesis of thyroxine hormone from the thyroid gland. This disorder is caused due to the deficiency of iodine that leads to the hyposecretion of thyroxine.
           <br/>
           (ii) Gigantism and dwarfism: Hypersecretion of growth hormone results in gigantism (very tall individual). On the contrary, the hyposecretion or deficiency of growth hormone at an early stage of life makes the person very short, i.e. causes dwarfism.
           <br/>
           (iii) Diabetes mellitus: Insulin secreted by the pancreas helps to lower the blood glucose level. When it is secreted in less amount, the body suffers from diabetes.) (3)
           <br/>
           (b) The pituitary gland secretes several hormones that regulate various functions of the body. It also controls the functioning of the other endocrine glands. Hence, it is called as master gland. The pituitary gland is located just below the hypothalamus at the base of the brain. (2)

           Question 36.
           <br/>
           Due to gradual weakening of ciliary muscles and diminishing flexibility of the eye lens, a certain defect of vision arises. Write the name of this defect. Name the type of lens required by such persons to improve their vision. Explain the structure and function of such a lens.

           Answer the following questions:
           <br/>
           (a) Draw a figure which show the arrangement for observing the phenomenon of scattering of light in the laboratory.
           <br/>
           (b) What colour would you observe in the experiment? Why?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The defect caused due to gradual weakening of ciliary muscles and diminishing flexibility of the eye lens is presbyopia. Presbyopia is the defect of the eye in which a person cannot see nearby objects comfortably and distinctly without corrective eye glasses. A presbyopic eye has a near point greater than 25 cm and is gradually increases as the eye becomes older. The type of lens required by such a person to improve the vision is bifocal lens.
          </p>
<p>
           A bifocal lens consists of both convex lens and concave lenses. The convex lens used in the bifocal lens to correct Hypermetropia (far-sightedness) and the concave lens is used to correct myopia (short sightedness).

           (b) 1. On the screen, first orange red colour and then bright crimson red colour patch is observed.
           <br/>
           2. From the other three sides of colloidal solution of sulphur in glass tank(T), blue colour is observed. This is because the very fine colloidal sulphur particles scatter away the blue colour from the path of beam and only red colour (least scattered) of the beam of white light reaches the screen through the solution.

           Question 38.
           <br/>
           Some metals are found in the earth’s crust in the Free State. Some are found in the form of the lr compounds. The metals at the bottom of the activity series are the least reactive. They are often found* in a free state. For example, gold, silver, platinum and copper are found in the Free State. Copper and silver are also found in the combined state as their sulphide or oxide ores. The metals at the top of the activity series (K, Na, Ca, Mg and Al) are so reactive that they are never found in nature as free elements. The metals in the middle of the activity series (Zn, Fe, Pb, etc.) are moderately reactive. They are found in the earth’s crust mainly as oxides, sulphides or carbonates. You will find that the ores of many metal s are oxides. This is because oxygen is a very reactive element and is very abundant on the earth.
          </p>
<p>
           Thus based on reactivity, we can group the metals into the following three categories- (i) Metals of low reactivity; (ii) Metals of medium reactivity;
           <br/>
           (iii) Metals of high reactivity. Different techniques are to be used for obtaining the metals falling in to each category.
           <br/>
           (a) Why the metal sulphides and carbonates must be converted into metal oxides prior to reduction?
           <br/>
           (b) Write chemical equations for the reduction of mercury from its ore Cinnabar?
           <br/>
           (c) Why highly reactive metals such as sodium, calcium, aluminium, etc., are used as reducing agents? Explain with an example.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Write the equations for Thermite reaction.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) It is easier to obtain metal from its oxide, as compared to its sulphides and carbonates. Therefore, metal sulphides and carbonates must be converted into metal oxides prior to their reduction.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) Cinnabar (HgS) is an ore of mercury. When it is heated in air, it is first converted into mercuric oxide (HgO). Mercuric oxide is then reduced to mercury on further heating.

<br/>
           (c) Highly reactive metals, such as sodium, calcium, aluminium, etc., are used as reducing agents because they can displace metals of lower reactivity from their compounds. For example, when manganese dioxide is heated with aluminium powder, the following reaction takes place.

           Question 39.
           <br/>
           How does a metal conductor conduct electricity? You would think that a low-energy electron has great difficulty passing through a solid conductor. Inside a solid, the atoms are packed together with very little spacing between them. But it turns out electrons can ‘travel’ through a perfect solid crystal smoothly and easily, almost as if they were in a vacuum.
          </p>
<p>
           The motion of electrons in a conductor, however, is very different from that of charges in space. When a steady current flows through a conductor, the electrons in it move with a certain average ‘drift speed’.
          </p>
<p>
           One can calculate this drift speed of electrons for a typical copper wire carrying a small current and it is found to be very small of the order of 1 mms
           <sup>
            -1
           </sup>
           .
          </p>
<p>
           How is it then that an electric bulb lights up as soon as we turn the switch ON? It cannot be that a current starts only when an electron from one terminal of the electric supply physically reaches the other terminal through the bulb because the physical drift of electrons in the conducting wires is a very slow process.
           <br/>
           (a) The electrons move with a certain speed inside the conductor when a battery is connected across it, is called ___________
           <br/>
           (b) The order of drift speed of electrons in copper wire is ___________
           <br/>
           (c) Do the drift speed and thermal speed of electrons inside a metal conductor remain the same?
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           How does an electric bulb light up as soon as we turn the switch ON?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) When the battery is connected across the conductor, then a steady current flows through the conductor and the electrons in it move with a certain average speed called drift speed. (1)
           <br/>
           (b) The drift speed of electrons for a typical copper wire is found to be in the order of 1 mms
           <sup>
            -1
           </sup>
           = 10
           <sup>
            -3
           </sup>
           m/s. (1)
           <br/>
           (c) No, the drift speed of electrons inside the conductor is much smaller than its thermal velocity. (2)
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           When we turn the switch ON, then free electrons near the electric bulb start drifting due to the electric field inside the conductor, hence electric current starts flowing through the bulb as soon as we turn the switch ON. (2)
