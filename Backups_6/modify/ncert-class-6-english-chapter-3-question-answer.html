           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Do you think cleverness can help us solve our problems? Why do you say so?
           <br/>

           <br/>
           Yes, cleverness can help us solve problems. In the story, the husband, wife, and Rama’s alertness and quick thinking solve the problem of the thief breaking into the house. Cleverness involves being resourceful, observant, and making wise decisions, which are often necessary to overcome challenges effectively.

           The next day, the neighbor asked the man in the story about what had happened. As the man, tell the neighbor what happened in your own words. Remember to include the following:
           <br/>
           when …………………………………………………………………….
           <br/>

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Hey there, neighbor! You won’t believe what happened last night. My wife and I were getting ready for bed when we heard a strange noise. She whispered to me to be quiet and listen, and we both froze, pretending to sleep. Sure enough, someone was trying to break into our house!
          </p>
<p>
           I came up with a plan and whispered it to my wife. We started talking loudly about what to name our future child, throwing around names like “Rama”. The thief thought we were just chatting, but really, we were trying to alert Rama, our village Kotwal.
          </p>
<p>
           We kept mentioning “Rama” in different scenarios, hoping the Kotwal would hear us. And it worked! He showed up just in time to catch the thief red-handed. It was a close call, but thanks to our quick thinking, our home and valuables are safe.
          </p>
<p>
           My wife and I are still shaking our heads in disbelief, but we’re also feeling proud of ourselves for outsmarting the thief.
