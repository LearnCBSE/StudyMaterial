           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Write one main difference between the asexual and sexual mode of reproduction. Which species is likely to have comparatively better chances of survival the one reproducing asexually or the one reproducing sexually ? Give reasons to justify your answer. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Asexual reproduction involves only one parent and the offsprings produced are clones and similar copies of their parents whereas sexual reproduction involves two parents and the offsprings produced are different from their parents. Offsprings produced by sexual reproduction have better chances of survival.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           Sexual reproduction leads to variation because it leads to the formation of offspring by the combination of DNA from both the parents, so the species will have better adaptability and better survival rate.

           What is meant by power of a lens ? Write its SI unit. A student uses a lens of focal length 40 cm and another of -20 cm. Write the nature and power of each lens. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The two laws of refraction are:
           <br/>
           1. The Incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane.
           <br/>
           2. The ratio of the sine of angle of incidence
           <br/>
           (i) to the sine of angle of refraction (r) at a point in a medium is constant, i.e., \(\frac { sin i }{ sin r }\) = Constant
           <br/>
           Absolute refractive index: It is the ratio of speed of light in vacuum (or air) to the speed of light in the given medium.
           <br/>

           Question 13.
           <br/>
           (a) List the factors on which the resistance of a conductor in the shape of wire depends.
           <br/>
           (b) Why are metals good conductors of electricity whereas glass is a bad conductor of electricity ? Give reason.
           <br/>
           (c) Why are alloys commonly used in electrical heating devices ? Give reason. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Resistance of a conductor depends directly on its length, inversely proportional to the area of crosssection, directly proportional to the temperature and it depends on the nature of the conductor.
           <br/>
           (b) Metals have free electrons which can move and conduct electricity, whereas glass does not have free electrons which can flow freely to conduct electricity.
           <br/>
           (c) The resistivity of an alloy is generally higher than that of pure metal. Alloys do not oxidize (bum) readily at higher temperatures. Therefore, conductors of electric heating devices, such as toasters and electric irons, are made of an alloy rather than pure metal.

           Question 14.
           <br/>
           Students in a school listened to news read in the morning assembly that the mountains of garbage in Delhi, suddenly exploded and various vehicles got buried under it. Several people were also injured and there was traffic jam all around. In the brain storming session the teacher also discussed this issue and asked the students to find out a solution to the problem of garbage. Finally they arrived at two main points—one is self management of the garbage we produce and second is to generate less garbage at individual level.
           <br/>
           (a) Suggest two measures to manage the garbage we produce.
           <br/>
           (b) As an individual what can we do to generate the least garbage ? Give two points.

           <br/>
           What is the dam ? Why do we seek to build large dams? While building large dams, which three main problems should particularly be addressed to maintain peace among local people? Mention them. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A dam is a barrier constructed to hold back water and raise its level forming a reservoir used to generate electricity or as a water supply.
           <br/>
           Large dams are built in order to generate electricity from water supply.
           <br/>
           While making large dams, social problems should be addressed. Proper rehabilitation should be provided to people.
           <br/>
           Judicious use of people’s money should be done to ensure economic prosperity. Environmental problems, excessive cutting of trees, biological diversity loss should be checked.

           (c) State Modem Periodic law. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) 1. Dobereiner:
           <br/>
           Advantage: Group three elements having similar properties they were called as the Dobereiner triads. He arranged them in order of increasing atomic mass and the mass of middle element was equal to the average of the other two elements.
           <br/>
           Limitation: He was able to identify only 4 triads but he failed in his attempt to group nitrogen, phosphorus and arsenic because atomic mass of phosphorus is not the average of other two.
           <br/>
           2. Newland:
           <br/>
           Advantages: He arranged the elements in horizontal rows in order of increasing atomic mass. The property of every 8th element was similar to the 1st element.
           <br/>
           Limitation: His arrangement was only applicable to lighter elements.
           <br/>
           3. Mendeleev:
           <br/>
           Advantage: He arranged the elements in order of their increasing atomic mass and he corrected the mass of beryllium from 4.5 to 13.5 u.
           <br/>
           Limitation: Position of hydrogen and isotopes were not justified in his periodic table.
           <br/>
           (b) Henry Moseley showed that atomic number of an element is a more fundamental property than its atomic mass.
           <br/>
           (c) Modem periodic law states that “the properties of elements are a periodic function of their atomic number. Repetition of properties is due to the same outer electronic configuration.”

           As the image of the object lying at infinity is not formed on the retina of the eye, so such object can not be seen clearly by the myopic eye. The far point of such an eye is near to the eye as shown in fig. (b).
           <br/>

<br/>
           This defect can be corrected by using a concave lens (minus powered) of suitable focal length. So, a man suffering from this defect wears spectacles having a concave lens of suitable focal length. The concave lens diverges the rays of light entering the eye from infinity. Hence, this lens makes the rays of light appear to have come from the far point (O’) of the defective eye as shown in figure (c).

<br/>
           (b) The twinkling of a star is due to atmospheric refraction of starlight. The atmospheric refraction occurs in a medium of gradually changing refractive index.
          </p>
<p>
           Since the atmosphere bends starlight towards the normal, the apparent position of the star is slightly different from its actual position. This apparent position of the star is not stationary but keeps on changing slightly, as the physical conditions of the earth’s atmosphere are not stationary. Since the stars are very distant, they approximate point-sized sources of light. As the path of light rays coming from the star goes on varying slightly, the apparent position of the star fluctuates and the amount of starlight entering the eye flickers i.e., the star sometimes appear brighter, and at some other time, fainter, which is the twinkling effect.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           (a) (i) Cornea: It is a thin membrane, covering the surface of eyeball, through which light enters. It acts as a primary lens, which provides the refraction for light rays entering the eye.
           <br/>
           (ii) Iris: It is a dark muscular dia-phragm that controls the size of the pupil and is located just be¬hind the cornea in the eye.
           <br/>
           (iii) Crystalline lens: It is converging in nature, made by the jelly¬like proteinaceous material. The focal length of the crystalline lens is changed by the ciliary muscles. Its function is to focus the incoming light rays from the object on the retina using its refractive property.
           <br/>
           (iv) Ciliary muscles: It modifies the curvature and thereby the focal length of the eye lens by contract-ing or relaxing itself to focus the image of an object on the retina according to the distance of the object. It also holds the eye lens in position.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) At the sunrise, the light from the sun has to travel the longest distance to reach the observer. Therefore, the sun looks almost reddish because only red colour (λb &lt; λr) which is least scattered, is received by our eye and appears to come from the sun. Hence, the appearance of the sun at the sunrise, near the horizon looks almost reddish.
           <br/>
           This phenomenon will not be observed by an astronaut on Moon, since there is no atmosphere so no scattering of light takes place, thus the Sun appears dark.

           Question 21.
           <br/>
           (a) State Fleming’s left-hand rule.
           <br/>
           (b) Write the principle of working of an electric motor.
           <br/>
           (c) Explain the function of the following parts of an electric motor:
           <br/>
           (i) Armature
           <br/>
           (ii) Brushes
           <br/>
           (iii) Split ring. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) According to this rule, stretch the thumb, forefinger and middle finger of your left hand such that they are mutually perpendicular. If the first finger points in the direction of the magnetic field and the second finger in the direction of the current, then the thumb will point in the direction of motion or the force acting on the conductor.

<br/>
           (b) Principle of the electric motor: When a coil carrying current is placed in a magnetic field, it will experience a force. As a result of this force, the coil begins to rotate.
           <br/>
           (c) (i) Armature: It creates a magnetic field and the second role is to generate an electromotive force.
           <br/>
           (ii) Brushes: Carbon brushes are used to make contact with the rotating rings of the commutator and through them to supply current to the coil.
           <br/>
           (iii) Split ring: Split rings are used to reverse the direction of current flowing through the coil every time the coil just passes the vertical position during a revolution.

           Question 22.
           <br/>
           A student added few pieces of aluminium metal to two test tubes A and B containing aqueous solution of iron sulphate and copper sulphate. In the second part of her experiment, she added iron metal to another test tube C and D containing aqueous solution of aluminium sulphate and copper sulphate. In which test tube or test tubes will she observe colour change? On the basis of this experiment state which one is the most reactive metal and why? [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Only in test tubes A, B and D she will observe colour change from green to colourless in A because aluminium is more reactive than iron, it will displace iron. She will observe colour change from blue to colourless in test tube B. She will also observe colour change in test tube D from blue to light green. Aluminium is the most reactive metal because it displaces all the other three metals.

           Question 26.
           <br/>
           An object of height 4.0 cm is placed at a distance of 30 cm from optical centre ‘O’ of a convex lens of focal length 20 cm. Draw a ray diagram to find the position and size of the image formed. Mark optical centre ‘O’ and principal focus ‘F’ on the diagram. Also find the approximate ratio of size of image to the size of object. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Given, f = +20 cm, u = -30 cm, h0 = 4 cm
           <br/>
           We know that,
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 10 Science 2018 Q26" height="266" loading="lazy" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48378237626_9acb961028_o.png" width="270"/>

<br/>
           Thus, the height or size of the image is 8 cm. The minus sign shows that this height is in the downward direction, that is, the image is formed below the axis.
           <br/>
           Ratio of size of image to object = \(\frac { -8 }{ 4 }\) = -2

           Question 27.
           <br/>
           The values of current (I) flowing through a given resistor of resistance (R), for the corresponding values of potential difference (V) across the resistor are given below: [2]
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 10 Science 2018 Q27" height="69" loading="lazy" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48378237566_5e7f896f95_o.png" width="403"/>
<br/>
           Plot a graph between current (I) and potential difference (V) and determine the resistance (R) of the resistor.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           We know that, V = IR
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 10 Science 2018 Q27.1" height="203" loading="lazy" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48378380662_9c26a2e8ca_o.png" width="388"/>
<br/>
           From the graph,
           <br/>
           V = 0.5
           <br/>
           I = 0.1
           <br/>
           0.5 = 0.1 × R
           <br/>
           ⇒ R = 5 Ω
