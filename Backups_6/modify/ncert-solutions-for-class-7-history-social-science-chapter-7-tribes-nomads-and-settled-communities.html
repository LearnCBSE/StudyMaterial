</strong>
           Administration of Ahoms
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<ol>
<li>
            The Ahom state depended upon forced labour.
            <ul>
<li>
              The forced workers were called paiks.
             </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
            A census of the population was taken.
            <ul>
<li>
              Each village had to send a number of paiks by rotation.
             </li>
<li>
              People from heavily populated areas were shifted to less populated places. — Ahom clans were thus broken up.
             </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
            By the first half of the seventeenth century, the administration became quite centralised.

<strong>
            6. What changes took place in vama-based society?

<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           The following changes took place in uama-based society:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Smaller castes or jatis emerged within vamas.
           </li>
<li>
            On the other hand, many tribes and social groups were taken into caste-based society and given the status of jatis.
           </li>
<li>
            Specialised artisans such as smiths, carpenters and masons were also recognised as separate jatis by the Brahmanas.
           </li>
<li>
            Jatis rather than vama became the basis for organising society.
           </li>
<li>
            Among the Kshatriyas, new Rajput clans became powerful.
           </li>
<li>
            Many tribes became part of the caste system. But only the leading tribal families could join the ruling class. A large majority joined the lower jatis of caste society.
           </li>
<li>
            Many dominant tribes of Punjab, Sind and the North-West Frontier had adopted Islam. They continued to reject the caste-system.
           </li>
</ul>

            7. How did tribal societies change after being organised into a state?

            <br/>
</strong>
           Changes in the Society
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            The emergence of large states changed the nature of tribal society.
           </li>
<li>
            Equal society gradually got divided into unequal social classes.
            <ul>
<li>
              Brahmanas received land grants from the Gond rajas.
             </li>
<li>
              They became more influential.
             </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
            The Gond chiefs now wished to be recognised as Rajputs.
            <ul>
<li>
              Aman Das, the Gond raja of Garha Katanga, assumed the title of Sangram Shah.
             </li>
<li>
              His son, Dalpat, married princess Durgawati.
             </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
            She was the daughter of Salbahan, the Chandel Rajput raja of Mahoba.

<strong>
            8. Were the Banjaras important for the economy?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           The Banjaras were very important for the economy. They were trader-nomads and controlled trade and commerce. They played an important role in transporting grain to the city markets. They usually bought grain where it was cheaply available and carried it to places where it was dearer. From there, they again reloaded their oxen with anything that could be profitably sold in other places.

<p>
<strong>
            The history of the Gonds was different from that of the Ahoms in the following ways:
           </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
            Gonds lived in Gondwana while Ahoms lived in Brahmaputra valley.
           </li>
<li>
            Gonds practiced shifting cultivation while Ahoms did not practice shifting cultivation.
           </li>
<li>
            Gond kingdoms were large, Ahom kingdom was small.
           </li>
<li>
            Gond kingdoms were divided into garhs, Ahoms built a large state.
           </li>
<li>
            Gonds did not use fire-arms, Ahoms used fire-arms for the first time in the history of the subcontinent.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
            The similarity is that both were tribes:
           </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
            The Mughals tried to control the lands of both at different point of time.
           </li>
<li>
            There were changes in society of both due to the diversification of occupations.
           </li>
</ol>

            Answer:
           </strong>
           The Ahoms were the tribal people who migrated to the Brahmputra valley from present-day Myanmar in the 13th century. They created a new state by suppressing the older political system of the bhuiyans i.e. landlords. During the 16th century, they annexed the kingdoms of the Chhutiyas in 1523 and of Koch- Hajo in 1581. They also subjugated many other tribes. In this way, the Ahoms built a large state and for this they used firearms as early as 1530s.

            1. Give a brief account of the tribal people found in different parts of the subcontinent [V. Imp.]
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Tribal people were found in almost every region of the sub-continent. In Punjab, the Khokhar tribe was influential during the 13th and 14th centuries. Later, the Gakkhars became more important. In Multan and Sind, the Langahs and Arghuns dominated extensive regions. The Balochis were another large and powerful tribe in the north-west. In the western Himalayas, the Gaddi Shepherds lived. The Nagas, Ahoms and many others lived in the distant north-eastern part of the subcontinent. In many areas of present-day Bihar and Jharkhand, Chero Chiefdoms had emerged by the 12th century.
          </p>
<p>
           However, they were subdued by the Mughals. The Mundas and Santals were other important tribes that lived in these states and also in Orissa and Bengal. The Kolis, Berads and numerous others lived in the Maharashtra highlands, Karnataka and Gujarat. Further there were large tribal populations of Koragas, Vetars, Maravars and many others in South. The Bhils were spread across western and central India. By the late 16th century many of them had become settled agriculturists and some even zamindars. Many Bhil clans, nevertheless, remained hunter-gatherers. The Gonds were found in large numbers across the present-day states of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.

<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Ahom society was divided into clans or Khels. There were very few castes of artisans, so artisans in the Ahom areas came from the nearby kingdoms. Kheloften controlled several villages. The peasant was given land by his village community. Even the king could not take it away without the community’s consent. The Ahoms worshipped their own tribal gods. But during the first half of the 17 century Brahmanas achieved great influence which gave rise to Hinduism.
          </p>
<p>
           In the reign of Sib Singh Hinduism became a predominant religion. However, the Ahom kings remained stick to their traditional beliefs to some extent even after adopting Hinduism. Ahom society was very sophisticated. Poets and scholars were given land grants. Theatre was encouraged

            3. How did the nomadic pastoralists earn their living? [V. Imp.]
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Nomadic pastoralists kept on moving from place to place with their animals. They lived on milk and other pastoral products. They also exchanged items like wool, ghee, etc. with settled agriculturists for grain, cloth, utensils and other products. They bought and sold these goods as they moved from one place to another, transporting them on their animals. The Banjaras were trader-nomads who bought grain where it was cheaply available and carried it to places where it was dearer.
          </p>
<p>
           From there, they again reloaded their oxen with anything that could be profitably sold in other places. Thus, they played an important role in connecting India to the outside world. Many pastoral tribes reared and sold animals, such as cattle and horses, to the wealthy people. Different castes of petty pedlars travelled from village to village. They made and sold wares like ropes, reeds, etc. Sometimes mendicants acted as wandering merchants. There were also castes of entertainers who earned their living by performing in different towns and villages.
