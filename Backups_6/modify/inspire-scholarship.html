The basic goal of INSPIRE 2023 is to deliver to the youth of the country the activities of creative pursuit of science, pull talent to the art of science at an early age and thus create the required significant human resource pool for sustaining and expanding the Science &amp; Technology system and R &amp; D base.
          </p>
<p>
           A prominent feature of the program is that it does not consider in conducting competitive exams to identify talent at any level. It concludes in and relies on the ability of the existing educational edifice to identify the talent.
