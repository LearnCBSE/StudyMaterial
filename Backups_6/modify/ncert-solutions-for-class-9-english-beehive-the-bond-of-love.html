<p>

           believe; receive; weird; leisure; seize; weight; reign; feign; grief; pierce This rule is applicable only in the case of ‘believe’ ‘grief’ and ‘pierce’ words. The other words have ei instead of ie.

            III. How to look at an Index
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           An index is a list of names or topics that are to be found in a book. It is a list arranged in alphabetical order at the end of a book. The following paragraph shows that the doctor is consulting the index of a medical book to find out which injection is appropriate for Bruno.
          </p>
<p>
           “Out came his medical books, and a feverish reference to index began: What poison did you say, sir ?” “Barium carbonate”, “Ah yes—B—Ba— Barium Salts—Ah ! Barium carbonate! Symptoms—paralysis—treatment— injections of… Just a minute, sir. I’ll bring my syringe and the medicine.”
          </p>

<br/>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           The Narrative Present
          </p>
<p>
           Notice the incomplete sentences in the following paragraphs. Here the writer is using incomplete sentences in the narration to make the incident more dramatic or immediate. Can you rewrite the paragraph in complete sentences?
           <br/>
           (You can begin : The vet and I made a dash back to the car. Bruno was still floundering…)
          </p>
<p>
           (i) A dash back to the car. Bruno still floundering about on his stumps, but clearly weakening rapidly, some vomiting, heavy breathing, with heaving flanks and gaping mouth.
          </p>
<p>
           Hold him, everybody! In goes the hypodermic—Bruno squeals—10 c.c. of the antidote enters his system without a drop being wasted. Ten minutes later : condition unchanged! Another 10 c.c. injected! Ten minutes later : breathing less stertorous—Bruno can move his arms and legs a little although he cannot stand yet. Thirty minutes later : Bruno gets up and has a great feed ! He looks at us disdainfully, as much as to say, ‘What’s barium carbonate to a big black bear like me?’ Bruno is still eating.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) In the paragraphs above from the story the verbs are in the present tense (e.g. hold, goes, etc.). This gives the reader an impression of immediacy. The present tense is often used when we give a commentary on a game (cricket, football, etc.), or tell a story as if it is happening now. It is, therefore, called the narrative present.
          </p>
<p>
           You will read more about the present tense in unit 10.
          </p>
<p>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) The vet and I made a dash back to the car. Bruno was still floundering about his stumps. He was also weakening rapidly. He was vomiting and breathing heavily. His flank was heaving and he had gaping mouth. The vet told everyone to hold him. He injected 10 c.c. of the antidote into his body. Not even a single drop was wasted. His condition did not change even after ten minutes. Another 10 c.c. of the antidote was injected. After ten minutes his breathing got less stertorous. Bruno could move his arms and legs a little. However, he could not stand. After thirty minutes, he got up and had a great feed. He looked at the vet and others disdainfully. He seemed to be saying, “What barium, carbonate to a big black bear like him?” He was still eating.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Read yourself and find out.

           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Pets have unique care and handling requirements and should only be kept by those with the commitment to understand and meet their needs. Give your argument in support of or against this statement.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In favour of the Motion, Pets play a significant role in the life of its owner. They become the members of the family. Animals do have emotions and sentiments. They play the role of a father, a mother and a brother/sister. They need to be tackled properly and utmost care. I am of the opinion that pets give us happiness and assist us in regaining confidence in the trying circumstances. These pets need proper care and love. Those who fulfil their requirements become the most fortunate people because they get true friends. It’s very difficult to get a worthy and honest friend in this commercial world. But animals reciprocate love and take care of the entire family. I strongly say that animals should be treated amiably and amicably.

           Report comes in support of snake charmers
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            By Our Staff Reporter
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           New Delhi, June 15. Over 30 years after the introduction of the Wildlife Protection Act (WPA) that banned the catching of snakes in India, a small community of snake charmers continues to practise the trade catching over 400,000 snakes every year — which ultimately die — in defiance of the law.
          </p>
<p>
           A report based on new research by the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), however, has strongly recommended that the traditional knowledge of the snake charmers and skills be now utilised for education and medicine by setting up sapera centres. This is mainly because the community has virtually no access to land, education or employment opportunities. They are dependent on snake charming to earn a livelihood. They trade around as vendors of traditional medicine, snake catchers and musicians. Ignorance about the law is quite common.
          </p>
<p>
           The report entitled ‘Biodiversity, Livelihoods and the Law: The Case of the Jogi-Nath Snake Charmers of India’ based on path-breaking research was formally released by the Inspector General of Forests, V.K. Bahuguna, along with a presentation by members of the sapera community in the Capital on Monday.
          </p>
<p>
           “Despite thirty years of the law being in existence, over 70 per cent of the Jogi-Naths are still dependent on snake charming to earn a livelihood. Ignorance about the law was quite common. None of them own land, even though they would like to,” said Bahar Dutt, who led this research. Notably, most of those practising the trade in the current generation are all under 35 years of age.
          </p>
<p>
           Trapping occurs throughout the year and during their travels, though this activity increases during the monsoons. According to the data, each family on an average collects at least seven snakes.
          </p>
<p>
           Most snakes were force-fed and snake husbandry methods and health were found to be poor. “The snake charmers community council imposes a heavy fine on a person if the snake dies in his custody as it is considered an extremely bad omen. As a result, the snakes are released when the charmers realise that their condition is deteriorating,” said Dutt. Their ambition to showcase the reptiles and earn money was not fulfilled, as they flouted four WPA provisions, for illegally possessing the animals, not feeding them properly, causing injuries by extracting teeth unscientifically and killing snakes for the valuable snake parts and bones. Their offence generally invites imprisonment for three to seven years and a fine up to Rs 25,000 in each case.
          </p>
<p>
           “On the positive side researchers found that the snake charmers possess a unique ability to handle venomous snakes with a tremendous knowledge of the different species and their behaviour. They are also called by local farmers to retrieve snakes, who would otherwise just kill them, from agricultural fields or human inhabited areas,” she said.
