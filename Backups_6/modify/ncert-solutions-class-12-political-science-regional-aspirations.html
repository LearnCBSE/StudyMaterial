             Answer:

</span>
           Punjab Accord was an agreement signed between the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Harchand Singh Longowal, the then President of Akali Dal in 1985 to be known as ‘Rajiv Gandhi Longowal Accord’ also to create normalcy in Punjab:
           <br/>
           1. Chandigarh would be transferred to Punjab.
           <br/>
           2. To appoint a separate commission to resolve border dispute between Punjab and Haryana.
           <br/>
           3. To set up a tribunal to settle down the sharing of Ravi-Beas river water among Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan.
           <br/>
           4. To provide agreement for compen-sation to better treatment to those affected by militancy in Punjab.
           <br/>
           5. To withdraw the Armed forces special power Act ip Punjab.
           <br/>
           But, peace could not be established easily in Punjab and resulted as follows:
           <br/>
           (a) It led to many excesses by police and violation of human rights.
           <br/>
           (b) It fragmented the Akali Dal.
           <br/>
           (c) President’s rule was imposed and normal political process was suspended.
           <br/>
           (id) Hence, Political process could not be restored in this atmosphere. Even during elections in 1992, only 24% electors turned out to vote. Consequently above mentioned added to tension between Punjab and its neighbouring states.

             4. Why did the Anandpur Sahib Resolution become controversial?

             Answer:
            </strong>
</span>
           Anandpur Sahib Resolution was passed at the conference of Akali Dal at Anandpur Sahib in 1973:
           <br/>
           (а) To ascertain regional autonomy and to redefine centre-state relations.
           <br/>
           (b) Sikhs aspirations aimed at ‘bolbala’ (dominance) of Sikhs.
           <br/>
           (c) It could also be interpreted as a plea for separate sikh nation despite of federal spirit.
           <br/>
           But, it became controversial due to following reasons:
           <br/>
           1. Due to lack of popularity of Akali Dal resolution had a United appeal.
           <br/>
           2. Akali government was dismissed in 1980s it lost its importance.
           <br/>
           3. Akali Dal launched a movement on the distribution of water between Punjab and its neighbouring states.
           <br/>
           4. Movement went into the hands of extremist elements from moderate Akalis and converted into armed insurgency for which Anandpur Sahib Resolution considered responsible.

             5. Explain the internal divisions of the State of Jammu and Kashmir and describe how these lead to multiple regional aspirations in that State.

             Answer:
            </strong>
</span>
           Jammu and Kashmir comprised of three regions:
           <br/>
           1. Kashmir region is Kashmir valley consisting Kashmiri speaking and mostly Muslim with a Kashmiri speaking Hindu minority.
           <br/>
           2. Jammu region consists of Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and speakers of various languages, in the areas of foothills and plains.
           <br/>
           3. Ladakh region is equally divided between Buddhists and Muslims and maintains an little population area.
           <br/>
           These internal divisions led to multiple regional aspirations:
           <br/>
           1. One strand of separatist to demand a separate Kashmiri nation independent of India and Pakistan.
           <br/>
           2. Some other groups want Kashmir to be merged with Pakistan.
           <br/>
           3. Third strand wants a greater autonomy for people of state within Indian Union.
           <br/>
           4. The demand for intra-state autonomy
           <br/>
           is as strong as the demand for the state autonomy.
           <br/>
           In present scenario, most of the separatist in dialogue are trying to re-negotiate a relationship of state with India.
          </p>

<strong>
             6. What are the various positions on the issue of regional autonomy for Kashmir? Which of these do you think are justifiable? Give reasons for your answer.

<span style="color: #339966;">
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
             Answer:
            </strong>
</span>
           On the issue of regional autonomy for Kashmir, the following positions are states as:
           <br/>
           1. Kashmiris were promised to make accession on reference of people after situation created by tribal invasion, becomes normal. But it has not been fulfilled, hence, it generated the demand for “Plebiscite”.
           <br/>
           2. Sometimes, it was felt that special federal status guaranteed by Article 370 has been eroded practically which led the demand for restoration of autonomy or “Greater State Autonomy”.
           <br/>
           3. It is felt that democracy, which is practised in rest of India has not been similarly institutionalised in Jammu and Kashmir.
           <br/>
           We prefer the first position because ‘Plebiscite’ provides better opportunity to people of J &amp; K to protect and sustain their regional autonomy in a very democratic manner.

             Answer:
            </strong>
</span>
           Because:
           <br/>
           1. It was against outsiders to maintain cultural integration of Assam.
           <br/>
           2. There was widespread poverty and unemployment in Assam, despite existence of natural resources like tea, coal and oil.
           <br/>
           3. It was felt that these were drained out of state without any commensurate benefit to the people.

             Answer:

</span>
           Because:
           <br/>
           1. Regional aspirations are part of democratic politics.
           <br/>
           2. Expression of regional issues is not an abnormal phenomenon.
           <br/>
           3. Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland have regional aspirations in United Kingdom.
           <br/>
           4. Regional movements are responded
           <br/>
           through democratic negotiations rather than suppression. –
           <br/>

</span>
           Yes, we agree with the statement because India adopted a democratic approach on these regional aspirations in place of considering them as anti-national:
           <br/>
           1. India’s democratic politics allows people and groups to address the people on the basis of their regional identity, aspiration, and specific regional problems.
           <br/>
           2. India’s democratic politics focus on regional issues and problems to receive adequate attention and accommodation in the policy making process, i.e. regional aspirations of Assam, Punjab and North-East, Kashmir etc.
           <br/>
           3. Its examples are in eighties, military erupted in Punjab, problems persisted in the North-East, students agitated in Assam and Kashmir valley was on the boil.
           <br/>
           4. The government of India settled down some negotiations with these regional aspirations to reduce tensions in many regions.
           <br/>
           5. Mizoram is an example of political settlement to resolve the problem of separation effectively.
           <br/>
           It can be concluded that regional aspirations do not encourage separation but these respect diversity to retain unity in the nation.

<br/>
<strong>
            The Assam Movement from 1979 to 1985 is the best example of such movements against ‘outsiders’. The Assamese suspected that there were huge number of illegal Bengali Muslim settlers from Bangladesh. They felt that unless these foreign nationals are detected and deported they would reduce the indigenous Assamese into a minority. There were other economic issues too. There was widespread poverty and unemployment in Assam despite the existence of natural resources like oil, tea and coal. It was felt that these were drained out of the State without any commensurate benefit to the people.

           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            The best way to respond to regional aspirations is through democratic negotiations rather than through suppression. Look at the situation in the eighties-militancy had erupted in Punjab: problems were persisting in the North-East: students in Assam were agitating; Kashmir valley was on the boil. Instead of treating these as simple law and order problems, the Government of India reached negotiated settlement with regional movements. This produced a reconciliation which reduced the tensions existing in many regions. The example of Mizoram shows how political settlement can resolve the problem of separatism effectively.

             Answer:

</span>
           Punjab Accord was an agreement signed between the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Harchand Singh Longowal, the then President of Akali Dal in 1985 to be known as ‘Rajiv Gandhi Longowal Accord’ also to create normalcy in Punjab:
           <br/>
           1. Chandigarh would be transferred to Punjab.
           <br/>
           2. To appoint a separate commission to resolve border dispute between Punjab and Haryana.
           <br/>
           3. A tribunal to be set up to settle down sharing of Ravi-Beas river water among Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan.
           <br/>
           4. To withdraw the Armed forces special power Act in Punjab.
           <br/>
           5. To provide agreement for compensation to better treatment to those affected by militancy in Punjab.
           <br/>
           But, peace could not be established easily in Punjab and resulted:
           <br/>
           (a) It led to many excesses by police and violation of human rights.
           <br/>
           (b) If fragmented the Akali Dal.
           <br/>
           (c) President’s rule was imposed and normal Political process was suspended.
           <br/>
           (d) Hence, Political process could not be restored in this atmosphere. Even during elections in 1992, only 24% electors turned out to vote.
           <br/>
           Consequently above mentioned added to tension between Punjab and its neighbouring states.
