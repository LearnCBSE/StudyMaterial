<p>
           It is reported that Kareena, a twelve year old girl living in Purkul, went back in time using a time machine.
          </p>
<p>
           Seventy years ago her home town was an ideal place to live in. Her home town had not been invaded by the marvels of technology. Industries had not been set up then, so the air was not polluted. She could see children playing in the garden. Some children were listening to the stories told by their grandmothers. Happiness and contentment prevailed everywhere.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            Read the dialogue.
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           Gautam : It’s quite some time since we met. I guess it’s because you’ve been busy as usual.
           <br/>
           Ravi : Yes, I’ve been directing a play – Tagore’s Chandalika. Did you hear about it?
           <br/>
           Gautam : Yes, I heard it was a great hit. In fact, I was planning to get in touch with you to ask for your help, to put on a play for our Annual Open Day. How did you go about staging your play?
           <br/>
           Ravi : Well …. First, we chose three possible plays, and divided ourselves into reading groups. Then we exchanged views and arrived at a decision.
           <br/>
           Gautam : What was your next step?
           <br/>
           Ravi : Casting, of course. Once we’d got the script ready, we selected the cast.
           <br/>
           Gautam : And then?
           <br/>
           Ravi : We held auditions for the main parts and then made a preliminary selection. Eventually we were able to make a final choice and assign the roles.
           <br/>
           Gautam : How did you plan your rehearsals?
           <br/>
           Ravi : We met for a couple of hours every evening. As the play took shape, we held longer and more intensive rehearsals.
           <br/>
           Gautam : Who else was involved in the production?
           <br/>
           Ravi : The stage crew and the technicians. But they didn’t come in until we were out of the initial phase.
           <br/>
           (The conversation continues.)
           <br/>
           Gautam decides to make a written record of how Ravi produced a play in order to try it too.

           Three possible plays were selected and Ravi’s friends were divided into reading groups. Then views were exchanged and a decision was arrived at. The next step was of casting. When the scripts were got ready, auditions were held and a preliminary selection was made. Then a final choice for the cast was made and roles (were) assigned.

           From whose perspective or point of view is this description given? How does the use of the passive voice help maintain this?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The description is given from the point of view of Dr. Godbole. The active voice is used when Dr. Godbole is doing something. However, the passive voice is used when something is being done to/for him.

           Question 13.
           <br/>
           Review of passives
           <br/>
           Look back on the exercises in this Unit. Discuss why the passive is used in each of these different circumstances.
           <br/>
           Can you think of any other times when it is best to use the passive?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The passive is used in the following circumstances:
          </p>
<p>
           1. The originator {doer) of the action is considered less important than the action itself. In other words, when the action is to be given more importance or is to be highlighted, we use passive voice.
          </p>
<p>
           2. We do not want to identify the originator (doer) of the action eg, (in the sentence Oranges are grown in Morocco.)
          </p>
<p>
           3. It is not necessary, relevant and not helpful to mention the originator {doer) of the action. For example, in the headline Terrorists Arrested mentioning the Police is irrelevant as it is implied or understood.
           <br/>
           This is especially useful when we want to be brief and eyecatching as in headlines, and notices etc.
          </p>
<p>
           4. We have to be more objective in a statement. For example, instead of saying ‘I think the Taj Mahal is the most beautiful mausoleum in the world’ we suggest (in not writing ‘I think’) that it is generally thought to be so. This is effectively done in shifting from a subjective view (T think’) to the objective one by not adding ‘I think’.
          </p>
<p>
           5. We are writing in a formal and academic style eg, reports of scientific experiments or of meetings etc. In writing these, the emphasis is merely on the facts etc. Therefore, these are to be as neutral and objective as possible. Repeating or mentioning the originator or the doer in them would look foolish.’
          </p>
<p>
           6. It is not known about the originator or the doer of the action eg, when a crime has been committed.
          </p>
<p>
           7. We want to describe events and actions from a single point of view eg, the report of Inspector Narayan.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) The other times when the passive is used are when a commentary is broadcast eg, of the Republic Day Parade etc.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 14.
           <br/>
           Imagine you are a famous person. Write a brief report (maximum 80 words) of a day in your life. Use the passive voice where you think it is appropriate. An example of how you might start is given below.
          </p>
<p>
           I woke up at 7 am and was given tea. It was a lovely cool morning so I decided to walk to the film studio. Normally I am driven….
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           I woke up at 7 am and was brought tea and newspaper. Normally I wake up at 6 am. At 8 am I was briefed by my PS of important meetings and engagements. The meeting of Education Secretaries was to be held at 9 am and I was driven to the venue at 8.50 am. At 11 am I was taken to Sisters of Charity School to inaugurate the Van Mahotsava Function. I planted a sapling and stressed in my inaugural address the need of afforestation. At 12 noon I was taken to the Vigyan Bhawan to address a Conference of Vice-Chancellors. I was to meet the Delegation of University and College Professors at 4 pm and was driven to the office for the purpose. Important files were seen and orders issued from 4.30 pm to 7 pm. I was taken to the University Auditorium to deliver a lecture at 8 pm.
