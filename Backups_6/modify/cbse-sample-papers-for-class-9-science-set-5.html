           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Option (A) is correct.
           <br/>
           Explanation: Atom 1 has 11 electrons means 11 protons. So its atomic number is 11, which is highest among the given atoms.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Rutherfordâ€™s a-particle scattering experiment showed that:
           <br/>
           (i) Electrons have a negative charge.
           <br/>
           (ii) The mass and positive charge of the atom is concentrated in the nucleus.
           <br/>
           (iii) Neutron exists outside the nucleus.
           <br/>
           (iv) Most of the space in the atom is empty.
           <br/>
           Which of the above statements are correct?
           <br/>
           (A) (i) and (iii)
           <br/>
           (B) (ii) and (iv)
           <br/>
           (C) (i) and (iv)
           <br/>
           (D) (iii) and (iv)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Option (B) is correct.
           <br/>
           Explanation: Points (ii) and (iv) are correct. An atom consists of a positively charged, dense and very small nucleus which has all the protons and neutrons. Positive charge is due to protons, as neutrons have no charge. Most of the space is empty because most of the alpha particles pass straight through the gold foil without any deflection. Electrons have negative charge.

           Why is it easier to stop a tennis ball in comparison to a cricket ball moving with the same speed?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Figure (a) represents uniform motion correctly. This is because, for uniform motion, the distance-time graph is a straight line, as in uniform motion object covers an equal distance in equal interval of time.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Tennis ball is lighter (less mass) than a cricket ball. Tennis ball moving with the same speed has less momentum (mass Ã— velocity) than a cricket ball. It is easier to stop tennis ball having less momentum than a cricket ball.

           Question 31.
           <br/>
           In which direction do the following forces act when an object is in motion? Explain with the help of an example.
           <br/>
           (a) Frictional force
           <br/>
           (b) Gravitational force [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Frictional force: Backwards
           <br/>
           Example: If a book slides across the surface of a desk, then the desk exerts a frictional force in the opposite (i.e., backwards) direction of its motion.
           <br/>
           (b) Gravitational force: Downwards Example: When we throw a ball in the air, it returns to the ground.

           Question 32.
           <br/>
           A body can have zero average velocity but not zero average speed. justify giving an example. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Average velocity = \(\frac{\text { Net displacement }}{\text { Total time taken }}\)
           <br/>
           Average speed = \(\frac{\text { Net distance }}{\text { Total time taken }}\)
           <br/>
           Net displacement can be zero but total distance cannot he zero. Hence, average velocity can be zero but not the average speed. e.g., body thrown vertically comes down to the ground has zero displacement. but distance travelled is 2h where h is height reached by the body.
          </p>

           Question 33.
           <br/>
           How defects in a metal block can be detected by using ultrasound? Explain. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Ultrasound can be used to detect cracks and flaws in metals blocks. The cracks or holes inside the metal blocks, which are invisible from outside reduces the strength of structure. Ultrasonic waves are allowed to pass through the blocks and detectors are used to detect the transmitted waves. If there is a small defect, the ultrasound gets reflected back.

           (e) Epithelial tissue present on the tongue
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) In desert habitats, protection against water loss is essential so, the epidermis is thicker in desert plants.
           <br/>
           (b) The waxy covering aids in protecting the plant against loss of water, mechanical injury and invasion by parasitic fungi.
           <br/>
           (c) Epidermis is the outermost covering of cells in plants. It is usually made up of a single layer of cells. On aerial parts of a plant epidemial cells often create a waxy, water-resistant layer on their outer surface to prevent loss o water from plant.
          </p>
<p>
           The cells of epidermis are present in a continuous layer without intercellular spaces. Small pores are present on the epidermis of the leaf. These pores are called as stomata, which help in gaseous exchange and transpiration.

           <br/>
           (a) In fig (ii), work done is positive. I
           <br/>
           (b) W = F Ã— d (Work = Force Ã— Displacement)
           <br/>
           (c) In case of negative work, the angle between the force and displacement is 180Â°.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           In figure (i), the direction of force, (F) and displacement are perpendicular to each other. There is no displacement in the direction of force so the work done is zero.
