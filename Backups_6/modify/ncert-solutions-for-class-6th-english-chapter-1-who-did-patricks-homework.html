           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans:
           </strong>

<strong>

           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans:
           </strong>
           Patrick had saved the tiny man’s life from the cat by not handing him back to the cat. So he promised to fulfil one wish of Patrick.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            3. What was Patrick’s wish? (3)
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans:
           </strong>
           Patrick hated doing homework. His greatest wish was that the little man should do all his homework till the end of the session.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            4. In what subjects did the little man need help, to do Patrick’s homework? (5, 6)
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans:
           </strong>
           The little man needed Patrick’s help in maths, English and history.

<strong>
            5. How did Patrick help him? (7)
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans:
           </strong>
           Patrick sat beside the little man and guided him. He brought books from the library and read out to him.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            6. Who do you think did Patrick’s homework – the little man, or Patrick himself? Give reasons for your answer. (9, 10)
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans:
           </strong>
           It was Patrick himself who actually did all the homework. He had to help the elf again and again with guidance and books.

            Writing  (Page 13)
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            A. This story has a lot of rhyming words, as a poem does. Can you write out some parts of it like a poem, so that the rhymes come at the end of separate lines? For example:
           </strong>
<br/>
           Patrick never did homework. ‘Too boring”, he said.
           <br/>
           He played baseball and Hockey and Nintendo instead.
           <br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           The man of the tiniest size
           <br/>
           was true to his word and wise
           <br/>
           Patrick saved the elf from the cat
           <br/>
           The elf promised to do all that
           <br/>
           Patrick loved sports and hated homework
           <br/>
           He wasted his time and studies shirk
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            B. Look at these sentences.
           </strong>
<br/>
           1.‘Too boring,” he said.
           <br/>
           2. Cleaned his room, did his chores.
           <br/>
           When we speak we often leave out words that can easily be guessed.
           <br/>
           We do not do this when we write unless we are trying to write as we speak (as in the story).
           <br/>
           So, if we were to write carefully, we would say:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Homework is too boring, he said.
           </li>
<li>
            He cleaned his room and did his chores.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
            C. Rewrite the following incomplete sentences carefully, so that the reader does not have to guess what is left out.
           </strong>
<br/>
           1.more and more books.
           <br/>
           2.too difficult.
           <br/>
           3.got up late, missed the bus.
           <br/>
           4.solved the mystery.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            Ans:
           </strong>
<br/>
           1. The writers and poets read more and more books.
           <br/>
           2. This personal question is too difficult to answer.
           <br/>
           3. When I got up late yesterday morning, I missed the school bus.
           <br/>
           4. Lord Krishna solved the mystery of life after .death.
