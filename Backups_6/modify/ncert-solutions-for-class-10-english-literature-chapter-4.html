           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Answer the following questions briefly :
           <br/>
           (a) What genre of stories does Jenkins want the narrator to write? Why?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Jenkins wants the narrator to write stories on the supernatural this time. He wants the narrator to do so because that is what the public wants. His stories are interesting and mysterious and his ghosts are propositions.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) Does the narrator like writing ghost stories? Support your answer with evidence from the story.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The narrator likes writing ghosts stories because a ghost story has been his first fiction. It has changed the narrator with the idea. The idea comes to the narrator out of nowhere when Jenkins wants the narrator to write, the story comes by itself and the narrator is always be able to dig one story.
          </p>
<p>
           (c) What makes Helen, the ghost, and her other co-ghosts organize The Writer’s Inspiration Bureau?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Helen and her other co-ghosts organise the Writers Inspiration Bureau for which they scout around until they find a writer without idea and with a mind soft enough to accept impression. The case is brought to the attention of the main office and one of them is assigned to it.
          </p>
<p>
           (d) Why had Helen, the ghost been helping the narrator write ghost stories? Why was she going on strike? What condition did she place for providing continued help?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Helen the ghost had been helping the narrator to write ghost stories because he had always needed ideas and Helen gave them. She was now going on a strike because they were called too often and the people were using Ouija boards as the medium. Helen wanted John to get
           <sub>
            t
           </sub>
           all his friends to stop using the board then only would they start helping them.
          </p>
<p>
           (e) How does the ghost undermine the narrator’s faith in his ability to write ghost stories?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The ghost thinks that the narrator can not write ghost stories but the ghosts give him the idea. Helen tells him that many a time it is she who has leant on his shoulder when he is thinking hard for an idea.
          </p>
<p>
           (f) Why does John want the ghost to disappear before his wife appears on the scene? What impression of his wife’s character do you form from his words?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           He asks the ghost to leave before his wife comes there, because he doesn’t want her to know his secret, moreover she would be afraid. These words show that his wife is suspicious and jealous.
          </p>
<p>
           (g) Why does the narrator hesitate to be a partner to Laura Hinkle during the Ouija Board Party?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The narrator hesitates to be a partner to Laura Hinkle during the Ouija Board Party, because the ghost has asked him not to use it, then only she would help the narrator with ideas for ghost stories and Laura Hinkle is also very flirtatious.
          </p>
<p>
           (h) What message does the ghost convey to the group that had assembled in the narrator’s house? What is their reaction to the message?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The ghost spelt T-R-A-I-T-O-R and then it said H-E-L-E-N. It wants to convey that someone had been trying to communicate with John through Mrs.Hunt’s and Mrs. Sprinkle’s Ouija. Everybody’s gaze turned towards the narrator and he came under the suspicion.
          </p>
<p>
           (i) Do you agree with the narrator calling the assembly of women “manipulators” ? Give reasons.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The narrator rightly calls the assembly of women manipulators. Lavinia “manipulated” by buying Ouija board but says that it is for John’s research. Laura Hinkle manipulates John by trying to be flirtatious in order to learn working on the Ouija board.
          </p>
<p>
           (j) Why is John’s wife angry? What does she decide to do?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           John’s wife is angry because as John’s hand moves faster and faster on the board, his companion starts to spell out traitor and then it spells. Helen. Miss Hinkle asks Lavinia whether she knows anyone by the name of “Helen”. Miss Hinkle tells her that someone by the name of Helen has been trying to communicate with John. Lavinia gets angry at this and becomes suspicious of John. She decides to leave John and goes back to her grandmother.
          </p>
<p>
           (k) Why does John wish he were dead?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           From different parts of the room other manipulators begin to report. Each of those five Ouija boards is calling John’s name. Lavinia is looking at him through narrowed lids as though he is some peculiar insect. The murmur of conversation rises louder and louder. Miss Hinkle says that John looks sly, he goes straight upstairs and dozes off. In the morning there is no sign of his wife. He has hardly seated himself at the desk as he finds a white slip of paper saying that Lavinia is going back to her grandmother and her lawyer will communicate with John. John reading it cried “I wish I was dead” because he feels sad that his wife is leaving him.
          </p>
<p>
           (l) When confronted by Lavinia about his flirtations over the Ouija Board, John insists that ‘the affair was quite above-board, I assure you, my love’. Bring out the pun in John’s statement.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Lavinia is getting suspicious
           <sup>
            4
           </sup>
           of John with the Ouija board as his Angers seem to stick to that dreadful board. It spells Helen that makes Lavinia suspicious. She says they do not know anyone by the name of Helen. She thinks there is somebody hiding there. Lavinia tells John there is not a bit use trying to deceive her, he is trying to conceal something. It is bad enough to have him flirt over Ouija board with that hussy to which John replies that the affair is quite above board which means that John has nothing to do with Miss Hinkle.
          </p>
<p>
           (m) John’s apprehensions about his wife’s reaction to her encounter with the ghost are unfounded. Justify.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           John thinks if Lavinia sees the ghost, she would react sharply but she doesn’t. A broad satisfied smile spreads over her face “I thought you were Helen of Troy, she murmurs”. The ghost said, “I use to be Helen of Troy, New York and now I’ll be moving along.” Lavinia falls at this.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Answer the following questions in detail :
           <br/>
           (a) After her reconciliation with her husband, John Hallock, Lavinia writes a letter to her friend expressing how her relationship with him had almost been on the verge of breaking and what saved it. Write her letter.
           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Dear friend,
          </p>
<p>
           I had bought Ouija board and arranged for an Ouija Board Party. My friends sat in couples with a board. There was a squeak of legs heard all around. I paired John with Laura Hinkle who had a flirtatious way. She tried to move her hand over the board and soon it spelt Helen. Then all the five boards echoed the same name. I got annoyed at this and suspected John for I did not know anyone by this name. I planned to leave him and go back to my grandmother. Our marriage was about to break but Helen’s ghost appeared before me and John that made me know the truth. It was all due to the Ouija board. It saved my break with John.
          </p>
<p>
           Yours Lavinia
          </p>
<p>
           (b) John Hallock reflects upon his experience with Helen’s ghost and in retrospect he finds it quite amusing. All the same he is relieved that he is no longer plagued by it. r Ironically, the self same ghost inspires his creativity and he writes a diary entry reflecting upon the comical aspect of his experience. Write his diary entry.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Tuesday 15th may, –
           <br/>
           20XX, 10.30 p.m.
           <br/>
           Dear Diary
           <br/>
           I was thinking of writing a ghost story when suddenly I saw an apparition taking shape in front of me. It named itself as Helen. The ghost told me that these ghosts helped people like us with ideas to write their stories. I imagined it to be something very funny that the ghost and his co-mates were coming up. But it suddenly appeared before me and Lavinia and it had also appeared by the Ouija boards surprising all the women. But the most interesting part that I realised was that the same ghosts inspired my creativity to write a ghost story.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 6.

           Question 7.
           <br/>
           Gladolia, the narrator’s cook, is an African. The language she speaks is different from that of the others. This is known as Dialect. A diqlect consists of words or phrases that reflect the regional variety of a language. An author often uses a regional dialect to make the dialogue more authentic. Initially a dialogue may seem a little difficult to understand. However, as you continue reading, the language will become more comprehensible Working in groups, write what Gladolia’s words mean as shown.

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Ghosts and haunting have fascinated the public for centuries. Although many doubt the existence of ghosts or other paranormal entities, many people dedicate their lives to searching and recording paranormal activity. Ghost tours, support groups, and research societies, to name just a few, permeate our society and seek to answer questions about paranormal activity.
          </p>
<p>
           Interview your friends, relatives and people in your neighbourhood about whether they believe in the existence of ghosts. Ask them to tell you of any specific experiences they might have had in this context. In your groups identify the most fascinating anecdote you gathered on the basis of your interactions. Narrate it to the class.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Ghosts, paranormal entities all these sound spooky and give me goosebumps. I interviewed some of imy friends and came to know about their most eerie experiences. However, some of the stories were really scary and I want to share one such story with you. It so happened that one of the my friends was visiting his grandparents’ place by train. It was night-time and there was no one in the compartment except my friend. He took out his sleeping bag and making himself comfortable started reading a book. While reading, he fell asleep. He woke up suddenly on hearing a knock at the door of his compartment that was bolted from inside, the train had halted at a platform. He got down from his berth and opened the door. But there was nobody outside. After bolting the door, he turned and again came a knock, this time louder than before. Suddenly, he recoiled in horror as he saw a small, white icy cold hand coming out of the closed door of the compartment. A strange scraping sound could also be hared that frightened him out of his wits. He shrieked loudly and was about to faint when the train began to move and he came back to his senses. When the T.T. arrived he shared this strange experience with him and was shocked to hear that many people had claimed to have seen the hand. For the rest of the journey, my friend just sat and prayed to God and felt relieved only when he reached his grandparents’ home safely. I also shuddered to hear his account.

           <br/>
           Stephen had to shift to a villa btplt in a lonely part of the countryside with his parents. His father worked as a forest ranger in one of the parts of India. There were stories about the place that an apparition haunted the area. The people of the village also believed in this witchcraft. The atmosphere, Stephen found around the place, was uncanny and mysterious. His parents did not believe in all these things. In the evenings they used to hear horrifying sounds and cries from the village. They were told that it was the witch doctor who performed all sorts of things to keep away evil spirits at night.

           One night it was cold and wet. The weather seemed to be unpleasant and Stephen found it difficult to sleep. Suddenly in the middle of the night he “woke up by a scratching sound on his windowpane. He looked through the darkness and saw something with a strange shape trying • to open the window, not able to visualise properly he groped for the torch and rushed to his parents room. But they could not find anything. Only the shrill cries of the witch doctor could be heard. Stephen became seriously ill. His father had to shift to the city. But the mystery was still there. People said that on a full moonlit night the village was haunted by a strange figure

           Question 12.
           <br/>
           While conventional Ghost stories are scary and gruesome, several modern versions are humorous. The Canterville Ghost, by Oscar Wilde, is one of the best ghost stories written in the vein of laughing satire. The story that you just read is another example in case. Humour arises out of the narrator’s ability to laugh at himself, clever use of language as well as comic situations. Discuss within your groups what makes the Shady Plot humorous. Share your views during a whole class discussion.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           People often say, ‘There’s no such thing as ghosts.’ But ask me and I’ll tell you one such spine- chilling account that will force you to believe in the paranormal visions. My best friend told me this grotesque tale of an old man who could be seen laughing and dancing on full-moon nights in his village. Once he was alone at home as his parents had gone to attend the wedding of a distant relative. It was the month of July and the rain was coming down in sheets. The dogs were howling outside in the streets. He felt shivers of fear down his spine and gathering courage, came out of his room to check if all the doors bolted properly. He heard somebody whispering outside the window and as he peeped out of the misty pane, he saw a spectre laughing wickedly. The sound was shrill and weird and in the darkness, he witnessed the abnormal looking old man dancing weirdly. The wind was howling loudly adding to the atmosphere, an eerie feeling. He let out a loud scream and ran back to his room. Just then, he heard a knock at the door. He crept in the corner but the knocks just didn’t stop. He gathered courage and slowly moved towards the main door. His fears vanished when he heard his parents calling his name. They were relieved to see him safe and assured him that there was nobody outside.
          </p>
<p>
           Generally, ghost stories have a kind of spookiness around them. The whole atmosphere is eerie and the ghosts are supposed to frighten people. But ‘The Shady Plot’ is illustrated differently. The setting is the house of the author. The ghosts were similar to human beings. When the author saw something strange taking shape, he was not at all scared rather seemed to doubt his senses into believing that she was a ghost not a real girl. To add to the humour the girl talked about going on strike with other ghosts with whom she had organized ‘The Writer’s Inspiration Bureau. Unlike ghosts she seemed too pathetic when she requested the author to ask his friends and acquaintances stop using the Ouija board. Even funniest was the incident when his wife suspected him of having an iffair with a ghost ‘Helqp’.
