           <br/>
           What kind of a person was Prabhat as a sportsperson?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Prabhat always wanted to win. His parents, teachers, and friends said that Prabhat never knew defeat. He could not bear losing, not even at marbles. Losing would make him terrible.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           How did Prabhat look at games?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Prabhat looked at games differently. If he sensed that he would lose the game, he would not play it. Winning a game would give him a kind of unique feeling.
          </p>

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           While playing Surya looks smiling and relaxed. He treats the game lightly and doesn’t mind the defeat in a game. But in the badminton courts, he is a real phenomenon. He continues laughing and cracking jokes.
          </p>

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Prabhat out of jealousy cheated in the game. This gave defeat to Surya. Surya didn’t care for it. But it affected the morale of Prabhat. He couldn’t sleep that night due to this bad feeling.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 7.
           <br/>
           How did Surya look at the defeat?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Surya looked at the defeat like a normal thing. He continued smiling and caring little about the defeat. He found in it fun happiness and entertainment. His happy smile never left his face.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 8.
           <br/>
           What did Prabhat look at the game after cheating?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Prabhat looked at games differently after cheating. He realised that to enjoy a game one need not bother about the scoreboard. One needed to enjoy the game for its own sake. What mattered was trying to do well and enjoying every moment of it.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Prabhat learned that there was a change in him. He had started playing even hide and seek. He felt sad when the game was going to end. He also started joking while playing. Prabhat was a new person with a new sporting spirit.
