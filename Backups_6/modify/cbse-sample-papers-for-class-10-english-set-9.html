           Reading Comprehension Through Unseen Passages
           <br/>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the following text. (10)
           <br/>
           1. Like all bad news and the common cold, allergies can pop up when you least expect them.
           <br/>
           I suddenly developed an allergy to crocin (Paracetamol) some years ago after having it all my life to treat everything from headaches to fever and toothache. A seafood-loving friend found himself unable to breathe after having Thai food for dinner. After undergoing a battery of expensive tests, he was told the chest tightness was not caused by a heart attack but by an allergy to shellfish, something he ate once a week and had never reacted to before.
          </p>
<p>
           2. A stuffed or drippy nose, frequent sneezing, an itchy throat, rash, sinus, ear pain, difficulty in breathing, stomach cramps and itchy, red or watery eyes are some of the common symptoms of an allergic reaction. Pollen, dust, polluted air and indoor pollutants such as dust mites, cigarette smoke and mould are among the common environmental pollutants, while other triggers include medicines, paint and chemicals in cleaners arid cosmetics such as hair colour and skin creams. Among foods, eight allergens account for almost 90% of food allergies: milk, soy, wheat, egg, peanut, tree nuts, fish and shellfish.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           3. Most of us wrongly believe that people with allergies are either born with the condition or develop identifiable symptoms in early childhood. An allergy can occur at any time in your life and experts say its prevalence among adults is rising. While most people who develop allergies as adults have experienced some allergic reaction-either to the same or an unrelated trigger before-a few have no history of sensitivity.
          </p>
<p>
           4. In an acute immune reaction, the allergy trigger may be one, but the symptom is usually caused by a combination of factors. Stress, a sterile environment that prevents the body from developing robust natural immunity and lifestyle-induced changes in the body’s hormonal balance are thought to be some triggers. This is borne out by clinical evidence that shows that women are more likely to develop allergies at puberty, after pregnancy and at menopause, all of which point to hormonal causes.
          </p>
<p>
           5. Of course, avoiding the allergy trigger and taking an anti-allergy medication as soon as you can, after exposure to an allergen is the best possible protection. Since, pollen levels generally peak in the morning, people with airway sensitivity and Asthma should postpone outdoor exercises to later in the day or stick to exercising indoors as deeper and more rapid breathing induced by aerobic exercise causes more pollen and dust being inhaled, which can wreck your airways and lungs.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           6. Allergies in adults can be treated using some anti-allergic medicines. For those who do not respond to the standard treatment, there’s always the option of a series of allergy shots to help the immune system to build up a tolerance to the allergy. In most cases, though, identifying and avoiding the allergen is enough to stay free of trouble.
          </p>
<p>
           Answer the following questions, based on the passage above.
           <br/>
           (i) How can you prevent/treat yourself from getting allergies? (1)

           (a) By avoiding the allergy trigger.
           <br/>
           (b) By taking an anti-allergy medicine as soon as there is exposure to an allergen.
           <br/>
           (c) Both (a) and (b)
           <br/>
           (d) None of the above
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (c) Both (a) and (b)
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) What are the common symptoms of an allergic reaction? Answer in about 40 words. (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The common symptoms of allergic reactions are stuffed or drippy nose, frequent sneezing, an itchy throat, rash, sinus, ear pain, difficulty in breathing, stomach cramps and itchy, red or watery eyes.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Complete the sentence appropriately. (l)
           <br/>
           Those people who do not respond to anti-allergy medicines can be given a ……………. to strengthen the immune system’s tolerance to allergy.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           a series of allergy shots
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) The passage includes some words that are opposites of each other. From the sets (a) -(e) given below, identify two sets of antonyms. (1)

</div>
<p>

          </p>
<p>
           (vi) How does exercising later in the day or indoors help people with airway sensitivity and asthma? Answer in about 40 words. (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           It is believed that people with airway sensitivity and asthma should postpone outdoor exercises to later in the day or stick to exercising indoors as deeper and more rapid breathing induced by aerobic exercise causes more pollen and dust to be inhaled, which can wreck airways and lungs.
          </p>
<p>
           (vii) When are women more likely to develop allergies? (1)
           <br/>

<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Read the following text. (10)
          </p>
<p>
           1. Sniffer dog. Tucker uses his nose to help researchers find out why a killer whale population off the northwest coast of the United States is on the decline. He searches for whale feces floating on the surface of the water, which are then collected for examination. He is one of the elite team of detection dogs used by scientists studying several species including right whales and killer whales.
          </p>
<p>
           2. Conservation canines are fast becoming indispensable tools for biologists according to Aimee Hurt, associate director and co-founder of Working Dogs for Conservation, based in Three Forks, Montana.
          </p>
<p>
           3. Over the last few years, though, so many new conservation dog projects have sprung up that Hurt can no longer keep track of them all. Her organization’s dogs and their handlers are fully booked to assist field researchers into 2012.
          </p>
<p>
           4. “Dogs have such a phenomenal sense of smell”, explained Sam Wasser, director of the Centre for Conservation Biology at the University of Washington in Seattle. He has worked with scat-detection dogs since 1997. Scientists have been using Conservation Canines in their research since 1997.
          </p>
<p>
           These dogs have enabled them to non-invasively access a vast amount of genetic and physiological information which is used to tackle conservation problems around the world. Such information has proved vital for determining the causes and consequences of human disturbances on wildlife as well as the actions needed to mitigate such impacts.
          </p>
<p>
           5. The ideal detection dog is extremely energetic with an excessive play drive. These dogs will happily work all day long, motivated by the expectation of a ball game as a reward for sample detection. The obsessive, high-energy personalities of detection dogs also make them difficult to maintain as pets. As a result, they frequently find themselves abandoned in animal shelters. The programme rescues these dogs and offers them a satisfying career in conservation research.

           <br/>
           (i) Complete the following analogy appropriately, based on your understanding of paragraphs 1,2 &amp; 5.
           <br/>
           We can say that conservation canines are becoming indispensable tools for biologists despite e the difficulty of maintaining them as pets due to their obsessive, high-energy personalities leading to their abandonment, because …………………..
           <br/>
           Answer:

           <br/>
           Sir,
           <br/>
           Through the columns of your esteemed daily. I would like to bring to notice of the concerned authorities that for the past few weeks, the manholes in the streets of my locality are all lying uncovered. It is causing a serious risk to the residents of the locality. Last week, a toddler escaped by just a few steps else he would have fallen into the manhole.
          </p>
<p>
           It is a serious concern and all the residents of my locality are worried about the risks involved because of these open manholes. During the day time, still, everyone can see and walk carefully, but at night, it becomes extremely hazardous.
          </p>
<p>
           I would be grateful of you publish my letter in the column of your esteemed daily so that I can reach out to the concerned authority and they can take immediate measures and do the needful as early as possible. All the residents will be highly obliged if necessary steps are taken at the earliest in this regard.
          </p>
<p>
           Thanking you,

<br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The given bar graph represents the preferences of children in a school for playing volleyball and basketball over six years, from 2014 to 2019. According to the graph, the number of students interested in volleyball started at 200 in 2014 and increased to 450 in 2016, then again decreased to 150 in 2019. On the other hand, the number of students interested in basketball started at 350 in 2014, decreased to 250 in 2015, increased to 400 in 2016, and remained consistent from 2017 to 2018 at 350. Therefore, it can be concluded that in the given period, the interest of students in volleyball fluctuated while the interest in basketball remained relatively stable. This information can be useful for the school administration to decide which games to encourage and promote among the students.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           B. Write an analytical paragraph based on the double bar graph showing the percentage growth in different sectors in a developing country from the year 2012 to 2022.
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 10 English Set 4 with Solutions 3" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-102179" height="272" loading="lazy" src="https://www.cbsetuts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-English-Set-4-with-Solutions-3.png" width="396"/>
<br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The bar graph displays the growth percentage in six sectors, namely Education, Private Sector, Government Sector, Medical, Transportation, and Agriculture in a developing country from 2012 to 2022. The data shows a concerning decline of nearly 25% in the Education sector from 2012 to 2022. In contrast, the Private Sector has seen a slight increase from less than 20% to 22% in 2022. The Government Sector, however, ‘has remained stable at 18% in both years.
          </p>
<p>
           The Medical and Transportation sectors have demonstrated considerable growth in 2022. Of these two sectors, the Transportation sector has improved more than the Medical sector, which has just doubled since 2012. The Agriculture sector has also shown a marginal decline from 12% in 2012 to 10% in 2022. Overall, while the Government, Medical, and Transportation sectors have displayed improvements, much more work needs to be done in the Education, Private, and Agriculture sectors.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           A. The Growth and Development of the Region
           <br/>
           The given maps illustrate how Meadowside village and Fonton, the neighbouring town have changed and developed over the years. It depicts the map of both the locations for the years 1962, 1985 and the present respectively. It is pretty evident from the maps that both the village and the town increased their size to have finally merged together. In 1962, the village and town were separate entities with different infrastructures, housing and facilities. There were no roads or rails to connect the village with the town. While there was a railway line going through Fonton and a road from Meadowside village, they went in completely different directions. By 1985, both the locations not only grew in size but were also connected by another road that extended to the West.
          </p>
<p>
           The growth and development of the region was unstoppable. Soon, the village and the town merged into a new area housing many luxurious facilities.
          </p>
<p>
           Now, the region has a new railway line and platform established between Meadowside village and Fonton. The new area even has a hotel and a business park that vouches for the great development of the region.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           B. Changes in the Mount Mary School’s Infrastructure
           <br/>
           The given diagrams show how the Mount Mary School located in Goa has undergone changes and development since the time it had been constructed in 1950. It is very clear from the diagrams that the main building of the school did not change throughout the years. But, all the other parts of the school were replaced by the needs of the time. In 1950, the school had a playground behind it, a farmland to its South-West and houses to the West of its complex. By the 1980s, the houses and the farmland were replaced. The houses were removed to make space for cars and to add science block to the school. The farmland was converted into a sports field. The latest additions were made in 2010 when the complex and its various parts were resized. While the science block remained unchanged, the areas of the playground and the sports field were reduced to make space for car parking. Concluding the main complex, that is, the school building is over 60 years old and very well accommodates the changing culture.

           <br/>
           (i) “The Lomovs and the Chubukovs have always had the most friendly, and I might

           The statement that “The Lomovs and the Chubukovs have always had the most friendly, and I might almost say the most affectionate, regard for each other” may seem true at first. The Lomovs and the Chubukovs have been neighbours for years and for this very reason, Lomov comes to Chubukov’s house with a proposal of marrying Natalya. However, as one moves ahead, the relationship may not be as affectionate as it seems. They constantly quarrel with each other over trivial issues and do not trust each other even a bit. They insult each other, and call each other names but still maintain a fagade of a happy relationship.

           (ii) The advice given by elders is crucial to young lives. Explain in the context of the poem ‘For Anne Gregory’. (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The advice given by elders is crucial to young lives holds for the poem ‘For Anne Gregory’. Anne had decided to change her hair colour so that somebody would love her for herself alone. However, the speaker informs her of an elder’s advice that only God will love her for herself. This advice of an elder is crucial for the younger generation as it makes them understand life. In this case, to withstand the temptations of physical beauty.

           (iii) Why didn’t Valli get off the bus when the bus stopped at the town? (Madam Rides the Bus) (3)
           <br/>
           Refer to the given lines from the text
           <br/>
           What glittering displays of clothes and other merchandise! Such big crowds!
           <br/>
           Struck dumb with wonder, Valli gaped at everything.
           <br/>
           Then the bustopped and off except Valli
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Valli did not get off the bus when the bus stopped at the town because she had to go back in the same bus. So, she took out the fare from her pocket and handed it to the conductor. She only wanted to have a ride on the bus.

           (iv) Maxwell was justified in thinking very highly of the airhostess. Justify. (Mijbil the Otter) (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Maxwell was justified in thinking very highly of the airhostess because of her courtesy and a great concern towards the passengers. She made sure that even Mijbil was comfortable during the flight and thus, Maxwell calls her ‘the very queen of her kind’.

           (v) In the poem The Trees’, the poet compares the trees to newly discharged patients. Highlight any two reasons for the same. (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The poet compares the trees with newly discharged patients who look half-dazed (half-slept) while going towards the door of the clinic because the trees are weak. They have been struggling since long to get freedom from the four walls of the house. They could not grow fully there as they did not get proper nutrition. Further, when they get out, they feel relieved to finally leave the place they didn’t want to be in, similar to hospital patients.

           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Answer ANY TWO of the following three questions, in about 40 – 50 words. (2 x 3 = 6)
           <br/>
           (i) Did you begin to suspect, before the end of the story, that the lady was not the person Horace Danby took her to be? If so, at what point did you realise this and how? (A Question of Trust) (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Yes, we begin to suspect before the end of the story that the lady was not the person Horace Danby took her to be. She was unusually calm on seeing Horace. This seemed strange. When she did not call the police and instead asked Horace to take out all the jewels from the safe, seems suspicious. Moreover, it seemed highly unlikely that she would forget the numberto open the safe. Therefore, it was evident, before the story ended, that the lady was not the person of Horace took her to be.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Why did Bholi at first agree to an unequal match? Why did she later reject the marriage? What does this tell about her? (Bholi) (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Bholi agreed to the unequal match at first to fulfil her parents’ wishes.
           <br/>
           Later on, she rejected the marriage when the bridegroom asked for a dowry
           <br/>
           This tells us that Bholi was not a timid and dumb girl. She was aware of her rights. She also knew how to fight for her own dignity and feared no one.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Describe Think -Tank in your our words. (The Book that Saved the Earth) (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Think-Tank was the ruler of the planet Mars. His head is huge and egg-shaped. He wears a robe decorated with stars and circles. He considered himself to be most powerful and most intelligent creature in the whole universe and was very proud of his intelligence.

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Answer ANY ONE of the following two questions, in about 100 – 120 words. (1 x 6 = 6)
           <br/>
           A. What do you think about Anne’s talent for writing essays which she wrote convincingly when punished by the teacher? (From the Diai’,’ of Anne Frank)
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           B. You have been asked to present an evaluation of the approach used by Amanda in the poem Amanda!’ to tackle the ragging nature of her mother. Write a presentation draft including your insights, in about 120 words.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A. When Anne was given extra homework to write an essay on ‘A Chatterbox’, Anne thought that she had to write convincing arguments to prove the necessity of talking. This fact tells us that Anne was an intelligent and sensible girl with a good sense of humour. She thought about the essay and her arguments for a long time to get an idea. When she got it, she presented her essay. In her essay, Anne argued that talking was a student’s trait. The only thing that she could do was try to control it.
          </p>
<p>
           She even justified that she could not cure it completely as she had inherited it from her mother. Yes, Anne passes a sense of humour. Anne’s sense of humour comes forward when in her third essay, she wrote a funny poem to express her trait of talking. Her poem consisted of a humorous story of how a father swan bit its ducklings to death because they quacked too much. Her poetry was received in the right way by Mr Keesing and he never punished her after that.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           B. In the poem titled ’Amanda’, the little girl named Amanda often escapes into her imaginary world. She does this to tackle the nagging behaviour of her mother. Her world of dreams gives her the freedom and peace that she seeks in reality. She gets lost in her daydreams while her mother is instructing her. In reality, her freedom is restricted. So, this becomes her shield and defence against the harsh realities that she goes through in life.
          </p>
<p>
           In her dreams, she imagines a happy and carefree life-as an orphan, a mermaid and Rapunzel- without her mother.
           <br/>
           I think Amanda’s approach to deal with her mother is not right. She should have talked with her mother regarding this issue and told her that she does not like to be nagged now and then and needs some freedom as she is a teenager now. I believe that an amicable solution could have been reached between Amanda and her mother and their differences sorted out if she had followed this approach.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 11.
           <br/>
           Answer ANY ONE of the following two questions, in about 100-120 words. (1×6 = 6)
           <br/>
           A. Do you think parents like Mrs Pumphrey exist? If yes, is it a good thing to pamper children? Why or why not? Answer about ‘The Triumph of Surgery’.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           B. Discuss the role of Ebright’s mother in making him a scientist. (The Making of a Scientist)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A. Yes, parents like Mrs Pumphrey exist. Such people spoil their children by making sure that all their demands are met. They not only feed them junk but also spoil their social habits in the name of giving them love and care. This kind of behaviour is very harmful to children. Such overprotective parental behavior also hinders their growth as adults. It develops greed and dependency in them. They become stubborn and do not learn to value anything. For them, hard work is a myth as they get everything easily. Over-pampered children often fail to face the hardships of life later, as for them life has been simple. So, pampering children in moderation is healthy, but excess of it is harmful. It is not just bad for humans but also for animals, as we see in the story ‘A Triumph of Surgery’.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           B. Richard’s mother played a huge role in making him a great scientist. She would take him on trips to encourage learning. He was a single child. After his father died, his mother made him the focus of her life. She would buy him all kinds of microscopes, telescopes and other equipment. After dinner, she gave him problems to solve. This helped Richard to learn a lot.
          </p>
<p>
           She was his only companion for a long time. She always tried to give him work that required no physical labour but those which enhanced his learning skill It was his mother who got him the book ’The Travels of Monarch X’. This book opened the world of science for Richard She also wrote to Dr Urquhart to guide her son. The scientist helped Richard and guided him. Thus, his mother shaped him into an extraordinary scientist.
