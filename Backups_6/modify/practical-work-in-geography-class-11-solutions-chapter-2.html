           2. Answer the following questions in about 30 words:
          </p>
<p>
           Question 2(i).
           <br/>
           What are the two different systems of measurement?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Kilometre, metre, centimetre etc. are used to measure the linear distances between two points on the ground. It is referred to as the Metric System of Measurement and presently used in India and many other countries of the world.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           Another units which are used are miles, furlongs, yards, feet, etc. These are two different systems of measurement of the distances used in different countries of the world. It is known as the English System of Measurement and is prevalent in both the United States and the United Kingdom. India also used this system for measuring/showing linear distances before 1957.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 2(ii).
           <br/>
           Give one example each of statement of scale in Metric and English system.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Metric System of Measurement
           <br/>
           1 km = 1000 Metres
           <br/>
           1 Metre = 100 Centimetres
           <br/>
           1 Centimetre = 10 Millimetres
           <br/>
           English System of Measurement
           <br/>
           1 Mile = 8 Furlongs
           <br/>
           1 Furlong = 220 Yards
           <br/>
           1 Yard = 3 feet
           <br/>
           1 Foot = 12 Inches.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 2(iii).
           <br/>
           Why is the Representative Fraction method called a Universal method?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Causes for the representative method being called universal:
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<ul>
<li>
            It shows the relationship between the map distance and the corresponding ground distance in units of length.
           </li>
<li>
            The use of units to express the scale makes it the most versatile method.
           </li>
<li>
            R. F. is generally shown in fraction because it shows how much the real world is reduced to fit on the map.
           </li>
<li>
            For example, a fraction of 1 : 2,50,000 shows that one unit of length on the map represents 2,50,000 of the same units on the ground i.e. one mm, one cm or one inch on the map representing 2,50,000 mm, 2,50,000 cm and 2,50,000 inches, respectively of the ground.
           </li>
<li>
            While converting the fraction of units into Metric or English systems, units in centimetre or inch are normally used by convention. This quality of expressing scale in units in R. F. makes it a universally acceptable and usable method.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Question 2(iv).
           <br/>
           What are the major advantages of the graphical method?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           This type of scale shows map distances and the corresponding ground distances using a line bar with primary and secondary divisions marked on it. This is referred to as the graphical scale or bar scale.
           <br/>
           Advantages:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            It can express scale not only in kilometres and metres but the readings may also be shown in miles and furlongs.
           </li>
<li>
            Unlike the statement of the scale method, the graphical scale stands valid even when the map is reduced or enlarged. This is the unique advantage of the graphical method of the map scale.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           3. Convert the given Statement of Scale into Representative Fraction (R. F.).
          </p>
<p>
           Question 3(i)
           <br/>
           5 cm represents 10 km
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Representative Fraction
           <br/>
<img alt="Practical Work in Geography Class 11 Solutions Chapter 2 Map Scale Q3" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-124981" height="44" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Practical-Work-in-Geography-Class-11-Solutions-Chapter-2-Map-Scale-Q3.png" width="188"/>
<br/>
           Distance on Map = 5 cm
           <br/>
           Distance on Ground = 10 km
           <br/>
           Representative Fraction
           <br/>
           = \(\frac{5}{10}\)
           <br/>
           = \(\frac{1}{2}\) km or 2,00,000
           <br/>
           Therefore representative fraction
           <br/>
           = 1 : 2,00,000 cm
          </p>
<p>
           Question 3(ii).
           <br/>
           2 inches represents 4 miles
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Representative Fraction
           <br/>
<img alt="Practical Work in Geography Class 11 Solutions Chapter 2 Map Scale Q3.1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-124978" height="44" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Practical-Work-in-Geography-Class-11-Solutions-Chapter-2-Map-Scale-Q3.1.png" width="188"/>
<br/>
           2 inches = 4 miles
           <br/>
           therefore, 1 inch = 2 miles (63,360 Ã— 2)
           <br/>
           1 inch on map = 1,26,720 inches on ground.
           <br/>
           Therefore representative fraction
           <br/>
           = 1:1,26, 720
          </p>
<p>
           Question 3(iii).
           <br/>
           1 inch represents 1 yard
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Representative Fraction
           <br/>
           = \(\frac{1}{36}\)
           <br/>
           Distance on Map = 1 inch
           <br/>
           Distance on Ground = 1 yard
           <br/>
           1 yard = 36 inches
           <br/>
           Representative Fraction =
           <br/>
<img alt="Practical Work in Geography Class 11 Solutions Chapter 2 Map Scale Q3.2" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-124979" height="44" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Practical-Work-in-Geography-Class-11-Solutions-Chapter-2-Map-Scale-Q3.2.png" width="188"/>
<br/>
           Therefore representative fraction = 1:36
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

           Question 3(iv).
           <br/>
           1 cm represents 100 metres
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>

<br/>
           Distance on Map = 1 cm
           <br/>
           Distance on Ground = 100 meters
           <br/>
           1 cm = 100 meters
           <br/>
           Representative Fraction =
           <br/>
           = \(\frac{1}{10,000}\)
           <br/>
           Therefore representative fraction
           <br/>
           = 1 : 10,000
          </p>

           Question 4(i).
           <br/>
           1 : 100,000 (into km)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           It means 1,00,000 cm on map represents 1 km on ground.
           <br/>
           It means 1,00,000 centimetre on map represents 1,00,000 cm on ground.
           <br/>
           Therefore, 1 cm represents 1 km
          </p>
<p>
           Question 4(ii).
           <br/>
           1 : 31680 (into furlongs)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           1 inch represents 31,680 inches
           <br/>
           1 mile = 8 furlongs
           <br/>
           1 furlong = 220 yards
           <br/>
           1 yard = 3 feet
           <br/>
           1 foot = 12 inches
           <br/>
           Therefore, 31680 inches = 31680 Divided by 12 x 3 x 220 furlongs = 4 furlongs
           <br/>
           Therefore, 31680 inches = 4 furlongs
          </p>
<p>
           Question 4(iii).
           <br/>
           1 : 126,720 (into miles)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           1 inch represents 1,26,720 inches
           <br/>
           1 mile = 63,360 inches.
           <br/>
           Therefore, 1,26,720 inches = 2 miles.
           <br/>
           Hence, 1 inch represents 2 miles.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 4(iv).
           <br/>
           1 : 50,000 (into metres)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           1 cm represents = 50,000 cm
           <br/>
           1 metre = 100 cm
           <br/>
           therefore, 1 cm represents 500 metres.
          </p>
<p>
           5. Construct a graphical scale when the given R. F. is 1 : 50,000 and read the distances in kilometre and metre.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           According to a standard, generally, a length of 15 cm is taken to draw a graphical scale. 1:50,000 means that 1 cm on map shows 50,000 cm on ground. In other words, 1 cm shows 50,000 cm.
           <br/>
           15 cm shows 50,000 x 15/1,00,000
           <br/>
           15 cm = 7.5 km
           <br/>
           Since 7.5 km is not an integer, so we can round it off to 5 or 10. Let us round it off to 5 km in this question.
           <br/>
           Therefore, we need to make the following calculations to express the scale on a length of 5 km.
           <br/>
           7.5 km is shown by 15 cm line.
           <br/>
           Therefore, for 5 km we can express it as 15 x 5/7.5
           <br/>
           0. 5 km will be shown by 1 cm on line.
           <br/>
           We can make the graph by following steps:
           <br/>
           First of all draw a 10 cm line and divide it in 5 important parts. Except for one part from the left, let us give all parts a distance of one km. Now divide the first part in 10 equal parts and each part will be equal to 100 metres. We can divide it in five parts as well and taking one part as 200 metre and so on.

          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Purpose of map: If map is being drawn to study the minor details then we should make use of large scale maps and if it is to show physical features or large areas, we can use small scale maps as well. For example scale of a map of a house will be larger than map of a country.
           </li>

           Answer:
           <br/>
           There are many limitations of representative fraction method. These are as follows:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            This method is only a fraction. It does not make use of any measurement system. Therefore it cannot be used to measure the direct distance between two places.
           </li>
<li>
            Whenever maps are changed using computers, these fractions get changed.
           </li>

           Question 5.
           <br/>
           In a scale statement it is mentioned that 1 inch represents four miles. Express it in representative fraction.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           1 inch on map represents 4 miles on ground.
           <br/>
           Or 1 inch = 4 x 63360 ( 1 mile = 63360 inches)
           <br/>
           1 inch = 2,53,440 inches.
           <br/>
           Therefore 1 inch on map represents a distance of 2,53,440 inches on ground. In other words, 1 unit on map represents 2,53,440 units on ground.

           Convert Representative fraction 1:2,53,440 into a statement of scale (metric system).
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The given representative fraction can be converted into statement of scale in following steps:
           <br/>
           1: 2,53,440 means that 1 unit on map represents 2,53,440 units on the ground. In other words, 1 cm will represent 2,53,440/1,00,000 km (because 1 km = 1,00,000 cm)
           <br/>
           Therefore, 1 cm = 2.5344 km In statement of scale form we can say that 1 cm represents 2.5344 km.

           In this way, 1 inch = 50,000 inches

           6 inches = 50,000 x 6/63360
           <br/>
           6 inches = 4.73 miles
           <br/>
           Since 4.73 miles is not an integer, therefore we take 5 as an integer on number line. Now we need to make following calculations to present number line as 5 miles.
           <br/>
           Since 6 inches = 4.73 miles
           <br/>
           Therefore 5 miles = 6 x 5/4.73
           <br/>
           5 miles will be represented by 6.34 inches.
           <br/>
           We can make the graph by following steps:
           <br/>
           First of all draw a 6.34 inches line and divide it in 5 important parts. Except one part from the left, let us give all parts a distance of 1.268 inch. Now divide the first part in 4 equal parts and each part will be equal to 0.32 inch.

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Construct a graphical scale for scale 1 inch = 1 mile and which can be read in furlongs and miles.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           For graphical scale, to know the length of the line we need to make following calculations.
           <br/>
           1 inch = 1 mile
           <br/>
           Since 1 inch = 1 mile and therefore, 6 inches = 6 miles We can make the graph by following steps:
           <br/>
           First of all draw a 6 inches line and divide it in 6 important parts. Except one part from the left, let us give all parts a distance of one 1 inch. Now divide the first part in 4 equal parts and each part will be equal to 0.25 inch.

           Map Scale Notes
          </h4>
<ul>
<li>
            A map scale provides the relationship between the map and the whole or a part of the earthâ€™s surface shown on it. We can also express this relationship as a ratio of distances between two points on the map and the corresponding distance between the same two points on the ground.

            Kilometre, metre, centimetre etc. are used to measure the linear distances between two points on the ground. It is referred to as the Metric System of Measurement and presently used in India and many other countries of the world.
            <br/>
            Metric System of Measurement 1 km = 1000 Metres 1 Metre = 100 Centimetres 1 Centimetre = 10 Millimetres
           </li>
<li>
            Another units which are used are miles, furlongs, yards, feet, etc. These are two different systems of measurement of the distances used in different countries of the world. It is known as the English System of Measurement and is prevalent in both the United States and the United Kingdom. India also used this system for measuring/showing linear distances before 1957.
            <br/>
            English System of Measurement
            <br/>
            1 Mile = 8 Furlongs
            <br/>
            1 Furlong = 220 Yards
            <br/>
            1 Yard = 3 feet
            <br/>
            1 Foot = 12 Inches

<h4>
           Map Scale Important Terms
          </h4>
<ul>
<li>
            Denominator: The number below the line in a fraction is called denominator. For example, in a fraction of 1 : 20,000, 20,000 is the denominator.
           </li>
<li>
            Numerator: The number above the line in a fraction is called numerator. For example, in a fraction of 1 : 20,000, 1 is the numerator.
           </li>
<li>
            Representative Fraction: It is a method of scale of a map or plan expressed as a fraction showing the ratio between a unit distance on the map or plan, and the distance measured in the same units on the ground.
           </li>
<li>
            Statement of Scale: The scale of a map may be indicated in the form of a written statement. For example, if on a map a written statement appears stating 1 cm represents 10 km, it means that on that map a distance of 1 cm is representing 10 km of the corresponding ground distance.
           </li>
<li>
            Graphical or Bar Scale: It shows map distances and the corresponding ground distances using a line bar with primary and secondary divisions marked on it. This is referred to as the graphical scale or bar scale.
           </li>
<li>
            Scale: The ratio between the distances of two points on the map, plan or photograph and the actual distance between the same two points on the ground is called scale.
           </li>
