           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Which of the following statements concerning methylamine is correct? [1]
           <br/>
           (a) Methylamine is stronger base than NH
           <sub>
            3
           </sub>
           .
           <br/>
           (b) Methylamine is less basic than NH
           <sub>
            3
           </sub>
           .
           <br/>
           (c) Methylamine is slightly acidic.
           <br/>
           (d) Methylamine forms salts with alkali.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Methylamine is stronger base than NH
           <sub>
            3
           </sub>
           .
          </p>
<p>
           Methylamine is stronger base than ammonia due to presence of alkyl group which has electron releasing (+ 1 effect). As a result, the electron density increases on the nitrogen atom and therefore, they can donate electron pair more easily than ammonia.

           <br/>
           (a) Both (A) and (R) are true, (R) is the correct explanation of (A).
           <br/>
           (b) Both (A) and (R) are true, (R) is not the correct explanation of (A).
           <br/>
           (c) (A) is true, (R) is false.
           <br/>
           (d) (A) is false, (R) is true.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 13.
           <br/>
           Assertion (A) Actinoids form relatively less stable complexes as compared to lanthanoids.
           <br/>
           Reason (R) Actinoids can utilise their 5f-orbitals along with 6d-orbitals in bonding but lanthanoids do not use their 4f-orbital for bonding. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (d) (A) is false, (R) is true.
          </p>
<p>
           (A) is false, (R) is true as actinoids possess greater tendency to form complexes as compared to lanthanoids because actinoid ions possess high charge and small size.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 14.
           <br/>
           Assertion (A) p-nitrophenol is more acidic than phenol.
           <br/>
           Reason (R) Nitro group helps in the stabilisation of the phenoxide ion by dispersal of negative charge due to resonance. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Both (A) and (R) are true, (R) is the correct explanation of (A).
          </p>
<p>
           Both (A) and (R) are true and (R) is the correct explanation of (A).
          </p>
<p>
           Question 15.
           <br/>
           Assertion (A) Acylation of amines gives a monosubstituted product, whereas alkylation of amines gives polysubstituted product.
           <br/>
           Reason (R) Acylation occurs at N-atom, whereas alkylation occurs at o/p position. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (c) (A) is true, (R) is false.
          </p>
<p>
           (A) is true but (R) is false as both occurs at N-atom. Acylation is a monosubstituted product because N is in conjugation with acyl group due to which nucleophilicity of N-atom is reduced.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 16.
           <br/>
           Assertion (A) All naturally occurring α-amino acids except glycine are optically active.
           <br/>
           Reason (R) Most naturally occurring amino acids have L-configuration. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (b) Both (A) and (R) are true, (R) is not the correct explanation of (A).
          </p>
<p>
           Both (A) and (R) are true, (R) is not the correct explanation of (A).
          </p>
<p>
           All naturally occurring a-amino acids are optically active since the a-C atom is asymmetric. These exist both in ‘D’ and ‘L’ forms.

           Question 17.
           <br/>
           Give reason for the following.
           <br/>
           (a) p-dibromobenzene has higher melting point than o-isomer. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Due to more symmetry in p-isomer, it fits better in crystal lattice than its o-isomer. Hence, have higher melting point.

           (b) Haloarenes are less reactive than haloalkanes and haloalkenes.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In haloarenes, the electron pairs on halogen atom are in conjugation with π-electrons of the ring as shown in figure.

<br/>
           C—Cl bond acquires a partial double bond character due to resonance. As a result, the bond cleavage in haloarenes is difficult than haloalkanes and haloalkenes therefore they are less reactive towards nucleophilic substitution reaction.

           Question 18.
           <br/>
           Explain how and why the rate of reaction for a given reaction gets affected when
           <br/>
           (a) temperature is raised.
           <br/>
           (b) reaction progresses. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a)
           <br/>
           The rate of reaction for any reaction increases with rise in temperature. At higher temperatures, larger fraction of colliding particles can cross the energy barrier (i.e. the activation energy), which leads to faster rate.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) The rate of reaction decreases as the reaction progresses. The rate of a reaction depends on the concentration of reactants. As the reaction progresses, the concentration of reactants decreases because the reactants start getting converted to products. Hence, the rate decreases.

           Question 20.
           <br/>
           Account for the following.
           <br/>
           (a) Sucrose is dextrorotatory but the mixture obtained after hydrolysis is laevorotatory.
           <br/>
           (b) Amino acids behave like salts rather than simple amines or carboxylic acids in aqueous solution. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Sucrose is dextrorotatory having [α]
           <sub>
            D
           </sub>
           = + 665°. On hydrolysis with dilute acids or enzymes, it gives equimolar mixture of D-(+)-glucose, and D-(-)-fructose. Since, D-(-) fructose has larger specific rotation than D-(+)-glucose, the resulting mixture has specific rotation of – 39.9°. Therefore, the mixture is laevorotatory.

           (a) Account for the two specific rotation values.
           <br/>
           (b) What is the specific name given to sucrose based on the above observation?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Sucrose is dextrorotatory but after hydrolysis gives dextrorotatory glucose and laevorotatory fructose. Since, the laevorotation of fructose (-92.4°) is more than dextrorotation of glucose (+ 52.5°), the mixture is laevorotatory.
           <br/>
           (b) The hydrolysis of sucrose brings about a change in the sign of rotation from dextro (+) to laevo (-). Thus, the product is named as invert sugar.

           Question 22.
           <br/>
           Give reasons of the following observations.
           <br/>
           (a) Alkylamine is more basic than ammonia.
           <br/>
           (b) Aniline is a weaker base than cyclohexyl amine.
           <br/>
           (c) Electrophilic substitution in case of aromatic amines takes place more readily than benzene. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a)
           <br/>
           Due to electron releasing inductive effect (+ l) of alkyl group, the electron density on the nitrogen atom increases and thus, it can donate the Ione pair of electrons mote easily than ammonia. Hence, alkylamine is more basic than ammonia
          </p>
<p>
           (b) In aniline, the lone pair of electrons on the N-atom is delocalised over the benzene ring. As a result, the electron density on the nitrogen decreases. But in cyclohexylamine, the lone pair of electrons on N-atom is readily available due to absence of resonance. Hence, aniline is weaker base than cyclohexylamine.
          </p>
<p>
           (c) Aniline exists as a resonance hybrid of the following five structures

           group.
           <br/>
           But in benzene there is no delocalisation of electron at any position and hence electrophilic substitution in case of aromatic amines takes place more readily than benzene.

           Question 23.
           <br/>
           Answer the following questions. [3]
           <br/>
           (a) Thermodynamic feasibility of the reaction alone cannot decide the rate of the reaction. Explain with the help of one example. (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Thermodynamic feasibility of a reaction depends on Gibbs free energy, i.e. AG must be negative for spontaneous process. Kinetic feasibility depends on the activation energy of reaction, the lesser is the activation energy, the greater is the feasibility of reaction, i.e. Diamond → Graphite, ∆G = -ve
           <br/>
           This process is thermodynamically feasible but it is very slow due to its high activation energy.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) A first order reaction is found to have a rate constant, k = 5.5 × 10

           . Find the half-life of the reaction. (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:

           (c) If half-life period of a first order reaction is x and \(\frac{3}{4}\)th life period of the same reaction is y, how x and y related to each other? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           For first order reaction, k = \(\frac{0.693}{t_{1 / 2}}\) = \(\frac{0.693}{x}\)

           (b) Why is C—X bond in haloarenes extremely less reactive towards nucleophilic substitution reactions?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In C—X bond, C-atom attached to halogen is sp
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
           -hybriciised. The sp
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
           -hybridised carbon with a greater s-character is more electronegative and can hold the electron pair of C—X bond more tightly than sp
           <sup>
            3
           </sup>
           -hybridised carbon in haloalkane with less s-character.
           <br/>
           Hence, it is extremely less reactive towards nucleophilic substitution reactions
           <br/>

<br/>
           Also, in Haloarenes, C—X bond is having a π-bond character due to delocalized electron pair of X X(halo) atom. Due to this breaking C—X bond gets together.

           (b) Grignard reagents should be prepared under anhydrous conditions. Why?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Grignard reagents are very reactive. They react with moisture present in the apparatus to form alkanes
           <br/>

           Question 29.
           <br/>
           Proteins are high molecular mass complex biomolecules of amino acids. The important proteins required for our body are enzymes, hormones, antibodies, transport proteins, structural proteins, contractile proteins etc. Except for glycine, all α-amino acids have chiral carbon atom and most of them have L-configuration.
          </p>
<p>
           The amino acid exists as dipolar ion called Zwitter ion, in which a proton goes from the carboxyl group to the amino group. A large number of α-amino acids are joined by peptide bonds forming polypeptides. The peptides having very large molecular mass (more than 10,000) are called proteins. The structure of proteins is described as primary structure giving sequence of linking of amino acids; secondary structure giving manner in which polypeptide chains are arranged and folded; tertiary structure giving folding, coiling or bonding polypeptide chains producing three dimensional structures and quaternary structure giving arrangement of sub-units in an aggregate protein molecule.
          </p>
<p>
           When a protein in its native form, is subjected to physical changes like change in temperature or chemical changes like change in pH, the hydrogen bonds are disturbed. Due to this, globules unfold and helix gets uncoiled and protein loses its biological activity. This is called denaturation of protein. The denaturation causes change in secondary and tertiary structures but primary structures remains intact.
          </p>
<p>
           Examples of denaturation of protein are coagulation of egg white on boiling, curdling of milk and formation of cheese when an acid is added to milk. (4)
          </p>
<p>
           Answer the following questions.
           <br/>
           (a) In which form do amino acids exist? How is the charge distributed in amino acids?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The amino acids exists as dipolar ion called Zwitter ion, in which a proton goes from the carboxyl group to the amino group.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) What information is furnished by secondary structure of proteins?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Secondary structure of proteins tells us about the manner in which the polypeptide chains are arranged and folded, i.e. If it is helical or pleated structure.
          </p>
<p>
           (c) What happens when a protein is subjected to harsh changes? Write the name of the process involved.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When a protein is subjected to physical or chemical changes, the hydrogen bonds present in them gets disturbed. As a result of this the globules gets unfolded and helix gets uncoiled, leading to loss in activity of protein. This process is called as denaturation of protein. e.g. Formation of cheese.
          </p>
<p>
           Or
          </p>
<p>
           How is quaternary structure of proteins formed?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Some of the proteins are composed of two or more polypeptide chains referred to as subunits. The spatial arrangement of these subunits with respect to each other is known as quartemary structures. These are 3-D structures. These subunits are held together by H-bonding and van der Waal’s forces.

           Question 30.
           <br/>
           Raj is investigating the melting point of different salt solutions. He makes a salt using 20 mL of water with a known mass of KCl salt. He puts the salt solution into a freezer and leaves it to freeze.
          </p>
<p>
           He takes the frozen salt solution out of the freezer and measures the temperature when the frozen salt solution melts. He repeats each experiment and gets following observations.

           Assuming the melting point of pure water as 0°C, answer the following questions.
           <br/>
           (a) One temperature in the second set of results does not fit the pattern.
           <br/>
           Which temperature is that? Justify your answer. (4)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Temperature -11.0°C does not fit the pattern. There has to be more depression in freezing point and hence a sudden drop in temperature is observed. The melting point also decreases on addition of salt. But trend observed on addition of 1.0 g of salt is different than that observed at other amounts.
          </p>
<p>
           Or
          </p>
<p>
           Why did Raj collect two sets of results?
           <br/>
           (b) What is the predicted melting point if 2.4 g of salt is added to 20 mL of water? Justify your answer.
           <br/>
           (c) In place of KCl, if Raj had used fructose, what would have been the melting point of the solution with 0.6 g fructose in it? (4)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Taking readings in two sets helps to avoid error in data collection and gives more accuracy in results.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) Depression in freezing point is directly proportional to molality.
           <br/>
           0.6 g depression is 3.8°C.
           <br/>
           1.2 g depression is 7.6°C.
           <br/>
           2.4 g depression will be 7.6 × 2 = 15.2° C.

           and NaOH. Compound ‘C’ does not give Fehling test but forms iodoform. Identify the compounds A, B and C and write all the chemical equations involved. (5)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Compound B gives Fehling test, which means it is aldehyde. Also, it forms an iodoform, so compound B is acetaldehyde.
           <br/>
           Compound C does not give Fehling test but gives iodoform, so it must be a ketone in which a methyl group is attached to carbonyl carbon.

           Question 33.
           <br/>
           Attempt any five of the following.
           <br/>
           (a) Why do transition elements show variable oxidation states?
           <br/>
           (b) Generally there is an increase in density of elements from titanium (Z = 22) to copper (Z = 29) in the first series of transition elements.
           <br/>
           (c) Transition elements and their compounds are generally found to be good catalysts in chemical reactions.
           <br/>
           (d) Why copper cannot replace hydrogen from acids?
           <br/>
           (e) Why first ionisation enthalpy of Cr is lower than that of Zn?
           <br/>
           (f) Mn
           <sup>
            3+
           </sup>
           is a good oxidising agent.
           <br/>
           (g) \(E_{M^{2+} / M}^{\circ}\) values are not regular for first row transition metals. (5)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Transition metals show a great variety of oxidation states in its compounds (variable valency) except the first and the last element. This is because of the fact that the difference in the energy of (n – 1)d electrons and ns-electrons is low which implies that electrons from both energy levels can takes part in bonding.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) From titanium to copper the atomic size of elements decreases and mass increases as a result of which density increases.
          </p>
<p>
           (c) The catalytic properties of the transition elements are due to the presence of unpaired electrons in their incomplete d-orbitals and variable oxidation states.
          </p>
<p>
           (d) The standard reduction potential of copper is positive (+0.34). Therefore, it cannot replace hydrogen from acids.
          </p>
<p>
           (e) The electronic configuration of chromium and zinc are
           <br/>
           Cr(24)=[Ar]3d
           <sup>
            5
           </sup>
           4s
           <sup>
            1
           </sup>
           and Zn(30) = [Ar]3d
           <sup>
            10
           </sup>
           4s
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
<br/>
           It is easy to remove electron from 4s
           <sup>
            1
           </sup>
           -orbital (unpaired electron) rather than from 4s
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
           orbital (paired electron). Thus, the first ionisation enthalpy of Cr is lower than that of Zn.
          </p>
<p>
           (f) Mn
           <sup>
            3+
           </sup>
           / Mn
           <sup>
            2+
           </sup>
           has large positive E° value. Hence, Mn
           <sup>
            3+
           </sup>
           can be easily reduced to Mn
           <sup>
            2+
           </sup>
           . Therefore, it is a good oxidising agent. Also, Mn
           <sup>
            2+
           </sup>
           has half-filled electronic configuration, so it is more stable than Mn
           <sup>
            3+
           </sup>
           state.
          </p>
<p>
           (g) There is decreasing negative electrode potentials of M
           <sup>
            2+
           </sup>
           / M in the first transition series due to increase in the sum of IE
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           and IE
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           . It shows that in general, the stability of +2 oxidation state decreases from left to right. Exceptions are Mn and Zn in which the greater stability of +2 state for Mn is due to half-filled d-subshell (d
           <sup>
            5
           </sup>
           ) and that of Zn is due to completely tilled d-subshell (d
           <sup>
            10
           </sup>
           )
