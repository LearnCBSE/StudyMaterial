            SECTION A
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           READING [20]
          </p>
<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below: [12]
           <br/>
           1. If one early June morning you are suddenly stopped in your walk by a ringing “piu-piu- piu-pee-pee-piu-piu” call coming from the trees in your park or garden, you will feel your heart suddenly lifted. Look around and you may see two large, handsome, black- and-white birds with long coattails chase each other through the trees. They are pied cuckoos, that have come from Africa, and are said to announce the arrival of the greatest show on earth the Indian monsoon. Be assured, the curtain will rise in a month or so.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           2. To get a proper view of the onset of the monsoon, you really need to be stationed anywhere on the coastline of India or up in the hills. The grand show of grey clouds approaches like an airborne army, preceded by cool breezes, filling the air with electric charge so that you feel very happy. Spear of lightning flickers in the sky and the sound of thunder makes you feel excited.
           <br/>
           And then, it pours. The cracked earth without any green cover sucks down the flood of water-and then Mother Nature goes mad. Seeds scattered or buried like grains of sand or pebbles in the ground suddenly come to life. Shoots of plants rocket skywards, roots plunge into the soft, spongy earth sucking up water and nutrients. It’s a hint the grasshoppers have been waiting for. And bugs, beetles, caterpillars, centipedes, etc. emerge in their billions, feasting on the fresh green plants in the fields (to the annoyance of many a farmer) as also on each other.
          </p>
<p>
           3. There are miracles and there is music too: singing golden frogs appearing in large numbers in a rain-filled ditch, taking part in a group song that Bollywood would have envied. They vanish the very next day. They’d been waiting patiently all through the blistering summer, deep underground, conserving whatever moisture they had soaked up. Fireflies wink through the trees in the hills, sending their greenish signals to one another in codes as precise as any we may use for our most secret messages.
          </p>
<p>
           4. All this is what the birds have been waiting for. Most birds have spent the spring and summer courting and now it’s time to settle down. Baby birds need a lot of high protein at frequent intervals, which the rich supply of insect life so happily provides: Caterpillars are eaten up in their millions, as are furry moths, earthworms slurped down like noodles, spiky dragonflies beaten to bits to soften them up into baby food. The long-legged storks and herons get busy with fishing.
           <br/>
           As for the big guys like lions and tigers in the jungles: they too had it relatively easy during the summer when their thirsty prey came to the waterholes. Now, with water easily available, in streams and ponds all over, they need to work harder for their meals. But yes, this is, perhaps, compensated by the arrival of baby deer and fawns are sweet and soft, not very experienced in the merciless ways of the lions and tigers, even if they may seem more like a snack than a main meal. The animals get a rest from us, too, as parks and sanctuaries close down, not so much out of kindness as because the roads become impassable.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           5. And then, just as you are beginning to tire of the green mould on your shoes, belts and bags, and of all the sniffles and snuffles that the rains also bring (bacteria and viruses also love this season), the clouds begin to disperse and float away in large armies. But before this happens, at least once, do go out in the midst of a downpour, raise your face to the heavens and dance and sing and celebrate this, the greatest show on earth.

<p>
           1.2 Answer the following questions briefly: [1 × 5 = 5]
           <br/>
           (a) What according to the author is the advantage of staying near the coast?
           <br/>
           (b) How does Mother Nature react to the monsoon rain?
           <br/>
           (c) What do bugs, beetles, caterpillars, etc. do after the rains?
           <br/>
           (d) Why do lions and tigers have to work harder to catch their prey during the rainy season?
           <br/>
           (e) Why are parks and sanctuaries closed during the rains?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The author feels the advantage of staying near the coast is that one can get a proper view of the onset of the monsoon.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) The author says that Mother Nature goes mad with the arrival of the monsoons. Scattered and buried seeds come to life. Shoots of plants rocket skyward, roots plunge into the soft, spongy earth sucking up water and nutrients.
          </p>
<p>
           (c) Bugs, beetles, caterpillars, etc. emerge in their billions after the rain, feasting on the fresh green plants in the fields and also on each other.
          </p>
<p>
           (d) It is easy for the lions and tigers to catch their prey when they come to quench their thirst at the waterholes during summers. But during the rainy season water is easily available in streams and ponds all over so the big animals need to work harder to catch their prey.
          </p>
<p>
           (e) Parks and sanctuaries close down during the rains because the paths to the sanctuaries become waterlogged making the roads impassable.
          </p>
<p>
           1.3 Find words from the passage which mean the same as each of the following: [1 × 2 = 2]

           <br/>
           (ii) disappear (para 3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           1.3 (i) declare – announce
           <br/>
           (ii) disappear – vanish
          </p>

           Read the passage given below: [8]

           1. There are two types of diabetes, insulin dependent and non-insulin dependent. 90-95% of the estimated 13-14 million people in the United States with diabetes have noninsulin dependent, or type II diabetes. Because this type of diabetes usually begins in adults over the age of 40 and is most common after the age of 55, it used to be called adult onset diabetes, its symptoms often develop gradually and are hard to identify at first; therefore nearly half of all the people with diabetes do not know it. So, someone who has developed Type II diabetes may feel tired or ill without knowing why. This can be particularly dangerous because untreated diabetes can cause damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves. While the causes, short term effects, and treatments of the two types of diabetes differ, both types can cause long term health problems.
          </p>
<p>
           2. Most importantly, both types affect the body’s ability to use digested food for energy. Diabetes does not interfere with digestion, but it does prevent the body from using an important product of digestion, glucose, for energy. After a meal, the normal digestive system breaks some food down into glucose. The blood carries the glucose or sugar throughout the body, causing blood glucose levels to rise. In response to this, insulin is released into the blood stream and signals the body tissues to metabolize or burn the glucose for fuel, which causes blood glucose levels to return to normal. The glucose that the body does not use is stored in the liver, muscle or fat.
          </p>
<p>
           3. In both types of diabetes, the normal function of glands is affected. A gland called pancreas makes insulin. In people with insulin-dependent diabetes, the pancreas does not produce insulin at all. People with non-insulin dependent diabetes usually
           <br/>
           produce some insulin in their pancreas but their body tissues do not metabolize the glucpse properly, a condition known as insulin resistance.
          </p>
<p>
           4. There’s no cure for diabetes vet. However, there are wavs to get relief from its symptoms. Foods that are rich in carbohydrates break down into glucose during digestion, causing blood glucose to rise. Also studies have shown that cooked foods raise blood glucose higher than rawyunpeeled foods. So we should eat such uncooked whole grain foods.

           GROW MORE TREES TO REDUCE POLLUTION
           <br/>
           By: ABC
           <br/>
           The relationship between trees and air pollution cannot be overlooked especially in the current scenario where we are struggling with the problem of pollution at a global level. As a study suggests, it is feared, that pollution could claim 6.2 million lives by 2050.
           <br/>
           As is a known fact that trees and other vegetation restrict airflow in their immediate vicinity thus preventing pollution. Planting more trees in the urban areas could also save thousands of lives around the world each year as trees soak up pollution and cool down deadly heat waves. Trees also absorb pollutant gases and filter particulates out of the air by trapping them on their leaves and barks.
           <br/>
           It is believed that in one year an acre of grown trees can provide enough oxygen for 18 people. So, trees should be planted effectively along roads and buildings so as to decrease the overall air pollution level for city residents. Trees are capable of both cooling and cleaning the air especially in urban spaces. They help in removing harmful particulate matter from the air around them.
           <br/>
           Though tree planting alone will not solve the problems of pollution and rising world temperature but it is definitely a cost competitive way to address this issue and thus improve the lives of millions of people.

           <br/>
           31st Oct. 20xx: The members of the Animal Lovers Club recently got an opportunity to visit the Mahatma Gandhi Animal Care Home. We were pleasantly surprised to see the good treatment and care given to animals there.
           <br/>
           This Animal Care Home which was started in 2013 has already saved the lives of 743 homeless animals till date. The people who work here and take care of the animals are genuine animal lovers who handle injured dogs and cats, abandoned pets and very old animals with a lot of kindness and compassion. They strongly believe that a caring atmosphere is a very essential part of animal care.
           <br/>
           This Animal Care Home also has well equipped medical rooms, qualified and experienced veterinary surgeons who derive great satisfaction from treating sick animals. With its green surroundings, clean and pleasant environment, this animal shelter is an ideal refuge for sick, abandoned and old animals. Also over 50 volunteers help this shelter in.- socialising animals that have gone through trauma, so that they can be rehabilitated into new homes.
           <br/>
           Initiatives should be taken up by the government and other NGOs to ensure that more of such good quality and humanitarian animal shelters are set-up.

           Question 6.
           <br/>
           The recent rise in incidents of violent behaviour of students is a matter of concern for all. The problem can be curbed if students learn how to manage anger.
           <br/>
           Write a speech on the topic in 150-200 ivords to be delivered in the school morning assembly. [10]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The recent rise in incidents of violent behaviour of students is a matter of concern for all. One way of curbing this problem is by-teaching students how to manage anger. Good Morning Respected Principal and Teachers and my dear Friends. I, …., am here before you all to speak on this topic.
           <br/>
           Anger is a basic human emotion that each one of us experiences. It could be the beginning of something deeper, like rage leading to violent actions and reactions. There has been a rise in violent behaviour of students wherein they have become destructive and are indulging in unnecessary violence. This problem needs our immediate attention and the most effective way to curb this is to teach students how to manage anger.
           <br/>
           Anger management involves skills not only of recognizing the signs of anger but taking action to deal with a situation in a positive way. When students learn how to manage anger they will understand how to identify frustrations at an early stage and also to try and settle them while remaining calm and in control because coping with anger is an acquired skill. When students are taught how to manage anger they will be able to recognize wTiat triggers this emotion and how they should respond to it for a positive result.
           <br/>
           I would like to conclude by saying that focusing on the solution and not just the problem is more likely to resolve this issue.

           “Everyone should become vegetarian.” Write a debate in 150-200 words either for or against the motion.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           ‘Vegetarianism’ has become a fashion or trend in the present times and the number of people who are rejecting to eat meat is constantly increasing. Good Morning Everyone, I, …, have come before you all to speak against the motion “Everyone should become vegetarian.”
           <br/>
           Though being a vegetarian is an essential key to living a healthy life, but whether a person should become or should not become a vegetarian must be a matter of personal choice. Let us not forget that man has been killing animals and eating them since the time he was a caveman, thousands of years ago. Moreover, meat is a rich source of protein that helps to build our bones and muscles. There is no doubt that an overconsumption of meat could be unhealthy, but if we eat a balanced diet of meat and vegetables we will remain healthy. At the same time it is a false assumption that vegetarianism leads to automatic health benefits.
           <br/>
           The human race has been blessed with a mind which is capable of thinking and reasoning.
          </p>
<p>
           So, whether we should consume meat or not, should be our own choice. There should be no compulsion as to everyone becoming a vegetarian. I would like to conclude by saying that being a vegetarian or a non-vegetarian does not determine the kind of person you are. It is just a way of life and it should entirely be our own decision to choose how we want to live it.

           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Answer the following in 120-150 words: [6]
           <br/>
           What impression do you form of Sophie and Jansie after reading the story, Going Placec’?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Sophie and Jansie were classmates as well as friends. They both belonged to lower middleclass families. But that is where their similarity ends. There is a striking contrast between their characters. Sophie is a day-dreamer and Jansie is practical. Sophie lives in a world of dreams and does not want to come out of this fairyland. She is an incurable escapist and dreams of having a boutique, becoming an actress or a fashion designer. Jansie, on the other hafd, is very grounded. Jansie has her feet firmly planted on the ground and knows they are both ‘earmarked for the biscuit factory’. She knows big things require big money and experience which they lack desperately. She advises Sophie to be sensible and not entertain wild dreams. … .
           <br/>
           Sophie and Jansie’s temperaments differ greatly. While Sophie shares her dreams only with one person, her brother Geoff, Jansie on the other hand is nosey. She takes an interest in learning new things about others and can spread stories in the whole neighbourhood.

           <br/>
           How did Edla bring about a change in the peddler? (The Rattrap)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Edla Willmansson displays qualities of compassion and understanding that transform the peddler and brings out his essential human goodness. Her human qualities help in raising him to the level of a gentleman and he is able to overcome petty temptations. The peddler, who always considered the whole world to be a rattrap, was finally able to release himself from this rattrap due to the sympathetic, kind and generous treatment of Edla and thus redeems himself from his dishonest ways. Despite knowing his real identity Edla continues to treat him like a captain and the peddler quite spontaneously starts behaving like a real captain. Edla’s compassion and the peddler’s reformation arouses our optimism and belief in the essential goodness of man and other human values.
          </p>
<p>
           Edla was the daughter of the ironmaster. She was a warm, sensitive and compassionate person. She understood in the first meeting that the peddler was scared of someone and he had not had a single day of peace. So she decided to let him spend Christmas with them in their house. She assured him that he could leave anytime he wanted after celebrating Christmas with them. Edla woke him up to eat food only. Otherwise she let him sleep for two days. She showed genuine goodness which brought about a positive transformation in the peddler. She continues to treat him like a captain and the peddler, quite spontaneously, starts behaving like a real captain.

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Answer the following question in 120 – 150 words:
           <br/>
           How did Tiger King succeed in killing ‘hundred’ tigers ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The chief astrologer had told the King that his death would come from a tiger. So to prove the astrologer wrong the King decided to kill a hundred tigers. He vowed that he would attend to all other matters only after killing one hundred tigers. Initially, the king seemed well set to realise his ambition. Then some dangers and difficulties cropped up. There were times when the bullet missed its mark and at other times the tiger would leap on him and he would have to fight the wild beast with his bare hands. The Tiger King was able to kill ninety-nine tigers this way and if he could kill just one more tiger all his fears would be over for good and he could give up tiger hunting. But the hundredth tiger could not be found.
          </p>
<p>
           The Dewan realized the disastrous results if the hundredth tiger was not found. So a tiger was brought in from the People’s Park in Madras and taken directly to the forest where the Maharaja was hunting. The King took aim and the tiger fell in a heap. The Maharaja was extremely happy to have finally killed the hundredth tiger. After he left the hunters took a closer look at the tiger and realized the tiger was not dead as the king had missed the aim. They decided not to tell the Maharaja and one of the hunters killed the tiger. The king was left under the impression that he had achieved his target of killing a hundred tigers.
           <br/>

           <br/>
           How does Jo show her independent thinking in the story, ‘Should Wizard Hit Mommy’?
           <br/>
           Ans. Jo, who is only four years old, shows her sense of independent thinking when she refuses to accept the ending of the story of Roger Skunk that her father is narrating to her. Jo wants that Roger Skunk should retain his sweet smell of roses instead of his original bad smell. So she insists that her father should change the end of Skunk’s story with the wizard hftting the ‘stupid’ mommy with his magic wand “right over her head”. When Jack refuses to do so she starts kicking her legs up and sits down on the bed with a great heave insisting vehemently and stubbornly that her father should change the end of the story the next day. Jo defiantly tells Jack,”Tomorrow you say he hit that mommy. Do it.”
