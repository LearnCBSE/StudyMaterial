           = 2,000 + 4,000 + 4,400
           <br/>
           ∴ (ii) = 10,400
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

<p>
           For Retail seller, 4,400 = (iii) + 400
           <br/>
           ∴ (iii) = 4,400 – 400
           <br/>
           = 4,000
          </p>
<p>
           Total (Value of Added) (iv) = 2000 + 2000 + 400

           Question 6.
           <br/>
           (A) If in an economy, the Investment Multiplier is 4 and Autonomous Consumption is ?30 crore, the relevant consumption function would be ……………. [1]
           <br/>
           (Fill up the blank with correct alternative)
           <br/>
           (a) C = 30 + 0.75Y
           <br/>
           (b) C = -30 + 0.25Y
           <br/>
           (c) C = 30 + 0.25Y
           <br/>
           (d) C = -30 – 0.25Y
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) C = 30 + 0.75Y
          </p>
<p>
           (a) As we know, Investment Multiplier = \(\frac{1}{1-MPC}\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ 4 =
           <br/>
           ⇒ 4 – 4 MPC = 1
           <br/>
           ⇒ 4 MPC = 3
           <br/>
           MPC = \(\frac{3}{4}\) = 0.75
          </p>
<p>
           ∴ Consumption Function = C + bY = 30 + 0.75Y …[C = Autonomous consumption b = MPC = ₹30 crores (given)]

           (B) Suppose, Country X has more inflation than Country Y. Which of the following is most likely situation to happen in such a case, assuming other factors being constant? [1]
           <br/>
           (Choose the correct alternative)
           <br/>
           (a) A surplus trade balance in Country X
           <br/>
           (b) A deficit trade balance for Country X
           <br/>
           (c) A rise,in exports from Country X to Country Y
           <br/>

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           In an economy, the value of Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS) is 0.25, what will be the value of increase in income, if investments increased by ₹200 crores? [1]
           <br/>
           (a) ₹200 crores
           <br/>
           (b) ₹150 crores
           <br/>
           (c) ₹1,000 crores
           <br/>
           (d) ₹800 crores
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (d) ₹800 crores
          </p>
<p>
           As we know, Multiplier (K) = \(\frac{1}{MPS}\) ⇒ K = \(\frac{1}{0.25}\) = 4
           <br/>
           Also, K = \(\frac{\Delta \mathrm{Y}}{\Delta \mathrm{I}}\) ⇒ 4 = \(\frac{\Delta \mathrm{Y}}{200}\)
           <br/>
           ΔY = ₹800 crores

           Question 12.
           <br/>
           (a) Giving valid reasons, state whether the following statements are true and false:
           <br/>
           (i) Dividend received from investment abroad is recorded on the credit side of the capital account.
           <br/>
           (ii) Depreciation of the Indian Currency will lead to promotion of Indian exports.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (b) Distinguish between Autonomous transactions and Accommodating transactions. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) (i) False, Dividend received is part of the Current Account of the Balance of Payments and not of the Capital Account. Thus, dividend received from investment abroad is recorded on the credit side of Current Account, as neither assets nor liabilities of the country get affected.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) True, Depreciation of the Indian currency implies that more rupees are now required to buy a foreign currency, say a dollar. This also implies that with a given amount of foreign currency more goods can be bought from the domestic market. Thus, depreciation of the Indian currency will lead to promotion of Indian exports as Indian exports become relatively cheaper for the rest of the world, thereby increasing the international competitiveness of Indian exports.

           Question 13.
           <br/>
           If planned savings exceed planned investments in an economy, explain its likely impact on income, output and employment. [4]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           According to the Savings and Investment approach, tjie national income in an economy is in equilibrium when planned savings (S) are equal to planned investment (I). Savings are the excess of income over consumption expenditure whereas investment refers to the expenditure incurred on creation of new capital assets.
           <br/>
           We can understand this with the help of a schedule and diagram:
           <br/>

<br/>
           This can be explained with the help of the given diagram:

<img alt="CBSE Class 12 Economics Question Paper 2019 (Series HFG1E5) with Solutions 7" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-169551" height="177" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CBSE-Class-12-Economics-Question-Paper-2019-Series-HFG1E5-with-Solutions-7.png" width="200"/>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
            SS is the savings curve that shows planned savings at different levels of income. It starts from a negative value because there must be some consumption when income is zero.
           </li>
<li>
            Investment curve (II) is parallel to X-axis representing autonomous investment which remains unchanged as income increases.
           </li>
<li>
            E is the equilibrium point where S = I and OY*,is the equilibrium level of income. Where ex-ante Savings is equal to ex-ante Investment.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           When Savings (S) &gt; Investment (I). When planned savings are more than planned investment, it means that households are not consuming as much as the firms expected them to do. This will lead to building up of undesired inventory. To clear the undesired rise in inventory, firms will reduce production, which also means fall in income and hence savings will reduce till planned savings and planned investment are again equal.

           Question 14.
           <br/>
           As per the following news published in “The Hindu” on 6th August, 2022:
           <br/>
           The Monetary Policy Committee (MFC) of the Reserve Bank of India raised the Repo Rate by 50 basis points.” Identify and explain the likely cause and consequences behind this type of action taken by the Reserve Bank of India. [4]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Repo Rate is the rate of interest charged by Central Bank on loans given to Commercial Banks. During a situation of excess demand leading to inflation, the Central Bank raises the Repo rate which discourages commercial banks in borrowing from the Central Bank. Increase in Repo rate forces Commercial banks to increase their own lending rates making credit costlier. As a result, the demand for loans falls discouraging investment. Also reduction in availability of credit helps in correcting the situation of excess demand and reducing inflationary gap.

           Question 15.
           <br/>
           (a) Explain the role of Central Bank as Governments’ agent and advisor. [4]
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (b) Define Reverse Repo Rate. Discuss briefly, how this instrument helps in controlling credit creation by commercial banks. [4]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) A Central Bank conducts the banking accounts of government departments. It performs the same banking functions for the government as a Commercial bank performs for its customers. It accepts their deposits and undertakes inter-bank transfers. It also gives loans to the government.
           <br/>
           As an agent, it manages the government’s public debt. It undertakes payment of interest on this debt and other related services to public debt. It accepts the payments of taxes from the public on behalf of the government and makes payments for the cheques issued by the government.
           <br/>
           It also gives advise to the government regarding money market, capital market, government loans and on economic policy matters.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (b) When the Commercial banks have surplus funds they can deposit the same with the Central Bank and earn interest. The rate of interest paid by the Central Bank on such deposits is called Reverse Repo Rate.
           <br/>
           When Reverse Repo Rate is increased, it encourages the Commercial banks to deposit more of their funds with the Central Bank. This has a negative effect on the lending capability of Commercial banks as it reduces the liquidity of the banks. Thus, this controls credit creation by Commercial banks.
           <br/>
           Whereas, lowering Reverse Repo Rate has the opposite effect as it increases the Credit Creation capacity of Commercial banks.

<br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) I. (i) Profit earned by foreign Banks in India is not included in National Income because it is factor income earned by a non-resident (foreign banks) from its contribution to production inside the domestic territory of India i.e., factor income paid to abroad and hence it is deducted.
           <br/>
           (ii) Yes, expenditure on upgradation of fixed asset by a firm will be included in National Income as it is a part of gross fixed capital formation.

           (b) I. No, I do not agree with the -given statement. In Expenditure method, the focus is on final expenditure on final goods and services (both consumption goods and capital goods) produced within the domestic territory of the country.
           <br/>
           The goods produced within the domestic territory can be purchased by residents (Private final consumption expenditure), Government final consumption expenditure, firms and government (Gross Domestic Capital Formation) and Non-residents (Net exports i.e., Excess of exports over imports). Imports are deducted because they are not produced within our domestic territory.

           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Class 12 Economics Question Paper 2019 (Series HFG1E5) with Solutions 8" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-169552" height="185" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CBSE-Class-12-Economics-Question-Paper-2019-Series-HFG1E5-with-Solutions-8.png" width="169"/>
<br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The given image depicts the environmental challenge of ‘Global Warming’. Global warming is a gradual increase in the average temperature of the earth’s lower atmosphere. It is caused by increases in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Burning of fossil fuels and deforestation are the major causes of Global Warming.
          </p>
<p>
           Ozone depletion which results in more UV radiation reaching the earth and harming the living organisms as well as Global warming which is resulting in rise in sea level, coastal flooding, extinction of species etc. are also some of the pressing environmental challenges being faced currently.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 29.
           <br/>
           (a) “In rural areas of India, more members of a family are engaged in work, yet the gross income of the family is generally low.”
           <br/>
           Identify the type of unemployment indicated in the above statement and explain the paradox associated with it. [3]
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (b) Explain the role of micro-credit system in meeting credit requirements of poor. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
<p>
           (a) The given statement indicates a situation of disguised unemployment. It is a situation when
           <br/>
           fhore than actually required number of workers are engaged in work. It is a very common type of unemployment in rural areas. Though there has been a sharp increase in the number of people working in agriculture but at the same time there has not been any corresponding increase in the area under cultivation.
          </p>
<p>
           The paradox associated with disguised unemployment in rural areas is that while there are more members of a family engaged in agricultural work, the gross income of the family is generally low. This is because the surplus labour force does not lead to any additional output which means that the family’s income is not proportional to the number of family members engaged in work.
          </p>
<p>
           Or
          </p>
<p>
           (b) Self Help Groups (SHGs) are an emerging phenomenon in the context of rural credit. They have emerged to fill the gap in ,the formal Credit System. The formal credit delivery mechanism has not only proven inadequate but has also not been fully integrated into the overall rural social and community development.
          </p>
<p>
           The SHGs promote thrift (saving habit) among the rural households. Small savings are mobilized by the SHGs and offered as credit to its members depending on their need. Credit is offered without any security and at a moderate rate of interest which is repayable in small instalments.
          </p>
<p>
           SHGs have also helped in the empowerment of women. Such credit provisions are generally referred to as micro credit programmes. Presently, more than 7 lakh SHGs are operating across different rural areas. These programmes are becoming popular among small borrowers owing to their informal credit delivery mechanism involving minimum legal formalities.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           During 1980-90, China was able to maintain a double digit growth rate of 10.3 % whereas India’s GDP was growing at a rate of 5.7%.
           <br/>
           During 2015-17, there was a decline in China’s growth rate which came down to 6.8%, whereas India’s growth rate registered an increase from 5.7% to 7.3%.

           Question 31.
           <br/>
           (a) (i) State the meaning of ‘Privatisation’. [1]
           <br/>
           (ii) ‘Agriculture sector has been adversely affected by the Economic reform process’. Comment. [3]
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (b) State and explain any two main causes behind infrastructural development by British rule. [4]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) (i) Privatisation is the processes of withdrawal of the government from ownership and management of public sector companies and setting it to private entities and individuals.
           <br/>
           (ii) Reforms have not been able to benefit Agriculture where the growth rate has been decelerating. It is because public investment in agricultural infrastructure like irrigation, power, roads, market linkages etc. (which played a crucial role in the Green Revolution) has reduced in the reform period. Also, removal of fertilizer subsidy increased the cost of production which severely affected the small and marginal farmers.
          </p>
<p>
           Due to LPG polices, there was reduction in import duties on agricultural products and lifting of quantitative restrictions on agricultural products which resulted in increased international competition for the Indian farmer.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (b) The British sought to achieve the following for their own benefit through the policies of infrastructure development:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Railways were developed to market the finished products imported from UK, into the interiors of the country.
           </li>
<li>
            Roads were constructed to mobilise the army and for carrying raw materials from the countryside to the nearest railway station or port for sending it to Britain.
           </li>
<li>
            The Post and Telegraph was developed for controlling and maintaining law and order situation in India.

           Question 32.
           <br/>
           State, with valid reasons whether, the following statements are true or false:
           <br/>
           (a) “Higher productivity and production are the outcome of investment in human resources.”
           <br/>
           (b) Rising population is not the cause for quality of human capital formation. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Given statement is true because of the following reasons:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Higher productivity of physical capital. Human capital formation increases productivity of physical capital accelerating the pace of economic growth as physical capital is created and, therefore, can be handled better by intelligent and skilled human beings.
           </li>
<li>
            Higher productivity levels. Human capital raises productivity levels in a country. Education gives people additional skills to earn more and enhance their living standards.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           (b) Given statement is false.
           <br/>
           Continuous rise in population has adversely affect the quality of human capital. It has reduced the per-capita availability of benefits of economic growth. Benefits of economic growth relating to housing, hospitals, education etc. have reduced due to rising population. Rising population has also lowered the capacity to possess skill and expertise required for economic growth.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 33.
           <br/>
           (a) (i) Define Agricultural diversification. [2]
           <br/>
           (ii) State the meaning of organic farming. Discuss how does it help in promoting sustainable development. [4]
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (b) (i) Discuss the need for promoting women’s education in India. [3]
           <br/>
           (ii) Explain absorptive capacity of environment with example. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) (i) Agricultural diversification refers to the re-allocation of some of farm’s productive resources such as land, capital, farm equipment and labour to other produces particularly to non-farming activities.
           <br/>
           (ii) Organic farming is a whole system of farming that restores, maintains and enhances the ecological balance. It is a system of farming that focuses on maintaining soil health (rather than plant health) so that farming becomes a sustainable process along with an eco-friendly environment.
           <br/>
           In recent years, considerable efforts have been made to create awareness about the harmful effects of conventional agriculture that relies heavily on chemical fertilizers and toxic pesticides. These fertilizers and pesticides enter the food supply, penetrate the water sources, harm livestock, deplete soil fertility and devastate the natural ecosystem. So, efforts are being made to develop technologies which are eco-friendly and are essential for sustainable development. Organic farming is one such eco-friendly technology. Organic farming is a system of farming that relies upon the use of organic inputs for cultivation. It uses crop rotation, animal manures and composts and natural pest control to maintain fertility of the soil.
          </p>
<p>
           Or
          </p>
<p>
           (b) (i) It is important to educate the women of a country because:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            It makes them economically independent and improves their social status.
           </li>
<li>
            Educating the women of a country significantly improves the quantity and quality of healthcare for women and children in a country.
           </li>
<li>
            It also favourably impacts the fertility rate as educated women understand the advantages and disadvantages of limiting the family size.
           </li>
<li>
            Promoting women’s education would also promote gender equality.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           (ii) Absorptive capacity means the ability of the environment to absorb degradation. Due to excess wastes being generated, we are on the threshold of an environmental crisis. The past development has polluted and dried up rivers and other aquifers making water an economic gold. Besides, the intensive and extensive extraction of both renewable and non-renewable resources has exhausted some of these vital resources compelling us to spend huge amounts on technology and research to explore new resources.
          </p>
<p>
           For instance, high population and the affluent consumption in the developing countries and production standards of the developed nations have placed a huge stress on the environment. Many resources are becoming extinct and the wastes generated are . beyond the absorptive capacity of the environment.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 34.
           <br/>
           Read the following text carefully and answer the given questions on the basis of the same and common understanding:
           <br/>
           India urged the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to relax rules to allow the country to export food grains from its public stocks to the nations facing food crises. India can help, reduce food insecurity but there is hesitation on the part of the WTO, in relaxing its rules. India’s Finance Minister said food, fuel and fertilizers are global public goods and ensuring access of these for developing and emerging economies is critical. She also shared India’s experiences, including robust gains in agriculture production, citizen centric food security programmes and innovative delivery mechanisms such as the One Nation one Ration Card Scheme. (Source : The Economic Times; July 16, 2022)
           <br/>
           (a) State and discuss any two objectives of World Trade Organisation. [4]
           <br/>
           (b) Name any two steps taken by India to strengthen the food security. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Objective of WTO are One of the objectives of WTO is to establish a rule based trading regime in which nations cannot place arbitrary restriction on trade.
           <br/>
           (ii) WTO aims at enlarging production and trade of services to ensure optimum utilisation of world resources.
          </p>
<p>
           WTO aims at conducting the international trade among the member countries in an open, uniform and non-discriminatory manner. It focuses on the free movement of capital across different nations (and not on the free movement of labour). In fact, free flow of capital serves the commercial interest of multinationals (MNCs) which largely belong to the developed f nations. The MNCs are able to find markets for their products in less developed countries like India. Free flow of labour, which would have served the economic interests of underdeveloped countries is not permitted by WTO. Accordingly, Indian labour does not have free access to the labour market of development nations. Also, developing countries are forced to open up their markets for developed countries but are not allowed access to the markets of developed countries. Therefore, developing countries feel cheated.
          </p>
<p>
           Or
          </p>
<p>
           (b) Steps taken by India to strengthen the food security are
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Introduction of citizen-centric food security programmes.
           </li>
<li>

           Question 29.
           <br/>
           (a) State with valid reason whether the following statement is true or false: [3]
           <br/>
           ‘Self employed workers are different from hired workers.’
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (b) Explain the importance of credit availability to farmers in rural development. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Statement is true.
           <br/>
           Self employed workers are those workers who are engaged in their own business or own profession For example, a farmer working on his own farm whereas hired workers are those workers who work for others. They render their services to others and in return for their services get paid in the form of wages or salaries, For example, a teacher working in a school.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Credit is the lifeline of farming in the rural sector. It is important because:
           <br/>
           (i) Growth of rural economy primarily depends on infusion of capital, regularly to realise higher productivity and production in agriculture and non-agricultural sector.
           <br/>
           (ii) As the gestation period between crop sowing and realisation of income after production is quite long, farmers’ need for money (credit) increases to meet the initial investment on seeds, fertilizers, implements and some other family expenses like marriage, death, religious ceremonies etc.
