            II.
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           When you were a young child, did your mother tuck you in, as the poet’s mother did?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Yes, my mother used to tuck me in when I was a child. Whenever I said that I could not do some work, she embraced me and took me in her lap to get that work done. She used to feel sad and dejected if I was involved in any mishap.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Do you like rain? What do you do when it rains steadily or heavily as described in the poem?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Yes, I like rain and prefer to take a bath in the rain for some time. But when it rains heavily, I stay inside and enjoy the beauty of nature.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Does everybody have a cosy bed to lie in when it rains? Look around you and describe how different kinds of people or animals spend time, seek shelter, etc. during rain.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           No, everybody is not so fortunate to have a cosy bed to lie in when it rains. There are some people who live at the railway platforms and bus terminal. They don’t have even bed sheet, what to talk of comfortable beds.
          </p>
<p>
           There are so many animals which don’t have any shelter and tremble under the dark sky in the rainy season.

           <br/>
           How is the rain a bliss for the poet? Describe.
           <br/>
           Answer:

           The poet has developed a deep attachment with the rain. When it rains, he desires to lie on his cozy bed and enjoy the falling of rain drops on the roof. There is some specific reasons for it. When he hears the pattering of rain drops, the sweet memories of his childhood evaporate in his heart. He becomes nostalgic and remembers his mother. The picture of his mother reels over his eyes. He recalls how his mother had liking for sweet dreams. Besides, the poet forgets his worries and becomes filled with new hopes and aspirations. Hence, the rain is a bliss for the poet.

           Humid showers hover over all the starry sky. The melancholy darkness gently weeps in the form of rain drops. The rain creates an echo in his heart. It also brings thousand dreamy fancies alive to his mind. The poet listens to the patter caused by the sounds of the raindrops on the roof. At this moment the memory of his mother comes alive into his mind. His mother is no more but the memory is still alive. He still feels her fondness of looking on him. The memory is still fresh while he is writing this song of rain. He also listens to the sound of the rain falling upon the shingles.

<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           What virtue do you find in the sound of rains?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The sound of rain is pleasing to the ear. When we hear this sound, we forget everything. We find ourselves in the world of fancies. We remember the sweet memories of the past in a peaceful heart. Of course, we are unable to forget such moments of life. We must take this lesson from the rain and create peace in the mind of people by our behaviour.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           How can the sweet moments of life help us?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When we remember the sweet moments of life, we forget every pain. Riches have no meaning. We can feel pleasure even in a cottage. In fact, when there is no peace in our heart, we cannot lead a peaceful life. Sweet moments refresh our brain and fill us with new energy. So, the sweet moments of life are the treasure of energy for us.

           Question 1:
           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>
           What happens when the poet listens to the patter of the rain? Do you think that rain is a narrative tool in the poet’s life ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The raindrops play music on the roof and create a sound of pitter-patter. To the poet this music is blissful. At die beginning of the poem there is certain tinge of sadness around which starts to weep away with the coming of raindrops. Every raindrop on the tiles of the roof creates a rhythm with the poet’s heartbeat. The poet tries to focus on listening to the pitter-patter on the roof whereas his mind weaves the recollections of fond memories of yester years.
           <br/>
           Rain bears a subtle link with all aspects of life. It serves as a powerful narrative tool in the poet’s life. It has added a layer of depth and fullness to the situation where the poet is concerned. It delivers an effective voice which communicates the apt moment of time and space as well as the emotions of the protagonist in a more poignant manner than mere words would do.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 2:
           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>
           There is an image of past in the poem, ‘Rain on the Roof’. Is this imagery similar to ones used in the poem, ‘The Road not Taken’ ? Explain.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In the poem, ‘Rain on the Roof’, past is being spoken about but not in terms of regret or sadness whereas in the poem, ‘The Road Not Taken’, there is sadness and regret as imagery. Rain lulls the poet into dreams which bring back the memory of his family and the loved ones.
           <br/>
           In the poem, ‘The Road Not Taken’, the poet is regretting his decision that he took years back. There is an imagery of past in both the poem but in the poem by Coates Kinney, this past imagery is the wonderful thought of a loving mother whereas, in the poem by Robert Frost, the poem is about regret. The road not taken symbolizes the choice to enter the unchartered land. It suggests that in making this choice he is trying to distinguish himself from the rest of the world by taking the less travelled, less worn road. Both the poems have the imagery of past. One creates a sense of love and want and create a somber mood. The other poem delves into the decision making power of the poet which took him places but could not satisfy him.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 3:
           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>
           Dreams hold importance in the poet’s life. Is it true ? Explain.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           This poem is depicting the overall mood on a rainy night. During night the humid cloud full of water creates dark shadows over the star studded sky. The poet dreams about his mother and the way she used to tuck him in bed. The poet’s dream of his mother reminds him of his childhood days. His mother used to tell stories to lull him into sleep full of dreams. The music being played on the rooftop is like the affectionate look by which his mother used to see him, while he was a kid. So dreams make him realize the importance of past and and the things that he now misses.
