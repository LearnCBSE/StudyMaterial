<img alt="NCERT Solutions for Class 8 Science Chapter 14 Chemical Effects of Electric Current Q4" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-106857" height="182" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Science-Chapter-14-Chemical-Effects-of-Electric-Current-Q4.png" width="219"/>
<br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The bulb may not glow because of the following reasons:
           <br/>
           (i) The wires in the circuit may be loosely connected.
           <br/>
           (ii) The bulb may be fused.
           <br/>
           (iii) The cells may be used up.
           <br/>
           (iv) The liquid may be an insulator, i.e., a poor conductor of electricity.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           A tester is used to check the conduction of electricity through two liquids, labelled A and B. It is found that the bulb of the tester glows brightly for liquid A while it glows very dimly for liquid B. You would conclude that
           <br/>
           (i) liquid A is a better conductor than liquid B.
           <br/>
           (ii) liquid B is a better conductor than liquid A.
           <br/>
           (iii) both liquids are equally conducting.
           <br/>
           (iv) conducting properties of liquid cannot be compared in this manner.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) liquid A is a better conductor than liquid B.
          </p>

<p>
           Question 6.
           <br/>
           Does pure water conduct electricity? If not, what can we do to make it conducting?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           No, pure water doesn’t conduct electricity. But when salt is dissolved in pure water, it conducts electricity.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 7.
           <br/>
           In case of a fire, before the firemen use the water hoses, they shut off the main electrical supply for the area. Explain why they do this.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The water used in the water hoses is not pure water and is a good conductor of electricity. So, the fire¬men shut off the electric supply before spraying water to save themselves and other people from electrocution.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 8.
           <br/>
           A child staying in a coastal region test the drinking water and also the seawater with his tester. He finds that the compass needle deflects more in the case of seawater. Can you ex¬plain the reason?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The seawater contains a huge amount of salts in comparison to drinking water, hence the seawater is a better conductor of electricity and it produces a stronger magnetic field in the wire and hence deflects the compass needle more.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Is it safe for the electrician to carry out electrical repairs outdoors during heavy downpour? Explain.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           No, it is highly dangerous to carry out the electrical repairs outdoors during the heavy downpour. It can cause electrocution, as water is a good conductor of electricity.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Paheli had heard that rainwater is as good as distilled water. So she collected some rainwater in a clean glass tumbler and tested it using a tester. To her surprise, she found that the compass needle showed deflection. What could be the reasons?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Rainwater is pure water which is an insulator but it gets mixed with air pollutants like sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides and form acidic solution, which is a good conductor of electricity. So, the compass needle showed deflection.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 11.
           <br/>
           Prepare a list of objects around you that are electroplated.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Objects that are electroplated are door handles, taps, rims of cycles, showers, the handlebar of cycles and bikes, gas burner, tin cans, metallic almirahs, buckles of belts, etc.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 12.
           <br/>
           The process that you saw in Activity 14.7 is used for purification of copper. A thin plate of pure copper and a thick rod of impure copper are used as electrodes. Copper from impure rod is sought to be transferred to the thin copper plate. Which electrode should be attached to the positive terminal of the battery and why?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The thick rod of impure copper plate is to be attached to the positive terminal of the battery because when electric current is passed through the copper sulphate solution, it gets dissociated into copper and sulphate. The free copper, being positively charged, gets drawn to the negative terminal of the battery and gets deposited on it. On the other hand the loss of copper from the solution is regained from the impure copper rod which is attached to the positive terminal of the battery.

           Activity 1 (NCERT Textbook, Page 173)
           <br/>
           Join the free ends of the tester together fora moment. This completes the circuit of the tester and the bulb should glow. However, if the bulb does not glow, it means that the tester is not working. Can you think of the possible reasons? Is it possible that the connections are loose? Or, the bulb is fused? Or, your cells are used up? Check that all the connections are tight. If they are, then replace the bulb with another bulb. Now test if the tester is working or not. If it is still not working then replace the cells with fresh cells.
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           In this activity, if the bulb does not glow, it means that either the connections of the circuit are loose or the bulb is fused or cells are used up. If the tester is working, it can be used to test the materials, i.e., whether it is a conductor or non-conductor of electricity.

           <br/>
           Collect a few small plastic or rubber caps of discarded bottles and clean them. Pour one teaspoon of lemon juice or vinegar in one cap. Bring your tester over this cap and let the ends of the tester dip into lemon juice or vinegar as shown in Fig. 14.1. Take care that the ends are not more than 1 cm apart but at the same time do not touch each other. Does the bulb of the tester glow? Does lemon juice or vinegar conduct electricity? How would you classify lemon juice or vinegar—a good conductor or a poor conductor?

<br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           In this activity the bulb glows which shows that lemon juice and vinegar both conducts electricity, hence they are good conductors of electricity.

           Activity 3 (NCERT Textbook, Page 174)
           <br/>
           Take the tray from inside a discarded matchbox. Wrap an electric wire a few times around the tray. Place a small compass needle inside it. Now connect one free end of the wire to the terminal of a battery.
           <br/>
           Leave the other end free. Take another piece of wire and connect it to the other terminal of the battery (Fig. 14.2).
           <br/>
           Join the free ends of two wires momentarily. The compass needle should show deflection. Your tester with two free ends of the wire is ready.
           <br/>
           Now repeat Activity 14.2 using this tester. Do you find a deflection in the compass
           <br/>
           needle the moment you dip the free ends of the tester in lemon juice?
           <br/>

<br/>
           Take out the ends of the tester from the lemon juice, dip them in water and then wipe them dry. Repeat the activity with other liquids such as tap water, vegetable oil, milk, honey. (Remember to wash and wipe the ends of tester after testing each liquid). In each case observe whether the magnetic needle shows deflection or not. Record your observations in Table 14.1.

           Thus, lemon juice, vinegar, tap water, milk, curd and water, and soda are good conductors of electricity while vegetable oil, honey, kerosene oil, and distilled water are poor conductors of electricity or insulators.
          </p>
<p>
           Activity 4 (NCERT Textbook, Page 175)
           <br/>
           Take about two teaspoonfuls of distilled water in a clean and dry plastic or rubber cap of a bottle. (You may obtain distilled water from your school science lab. You may also get distilled water from a medical store or a doctor or a nurse). Use the tester to test whether distilled water conducts electricity or not. What do you find? Does distilled water conduct electricity? Now dissolve a pinch of common salt in distilled water. Again test. What do you conclude this time?
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           If the tester is put in distilled water, the bulb of the tester does not glow. This shows that distilled water does not conduct electricity. But when salt is dissolved in distilled water and again tested, the bulb glows which shows that water containing salts conduct electricity. Thus water which is free of salts are poor conductors while water with salts is a good conductor of electricity.
          </p>
<p>
           Activity 5 (NCERT Textbook, Page 176)
           <br/>
           Jake three clean plastic or rubber caps of bottles. Pour about two teaspoonfuls of distilled water in each of them. Add a few drops of lemon juice or dilute hydrochloric acid to distilled water in one cap. Now in the second cap containing distilled water, add a few drops of a base such as caustic soda or potassium iodide. Add a little sugar to the distilled water in the third cap and dissolve it. Test which solutions conduct electricity and which do not. What results do you obtain?
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           First and second cap with acid and base respectively, conducts electricity whereas third cap having sugar dissolved in distilled water do not conduct electricity.
          </p>
<p>
           Activity 6 (NCERT Textbook, Page 176)
           <br/>
           Take out carbon rods carefully from two discarded cells. Clean their metal caps with sand paper. Wrap copper wires around the metal caps of the carbon rods and join them to a battery (Fig. 14.3). We call these two rods electrodes. (Instead of carbon rods, you may take two iron nails about 6 cm long.) Pour a cupful of water in a glass/ plastic bowl. Add a teaspoonful of salt or a few drops of lemon juice to water to make it more conducting. Now immerse the electrodes in this solution. Make sure that the metal caps of the carbon rods are outside the water. Wait for 3-4 minutes. Observe the electrodes carefully. Do you notice any gas bubbles near the electrodes? Can we call the change taking place in the solution a chemical change? Recall the definition of a chemical change that you learnt in Class VII.

<br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           On passing electric current through the conducting solution of lemon juice and water, chemical reaction takes place. Water is dissociated into its constituent gases, i.e., hydrogen and oxygen. Oxygen bubbles are formed on the electrode connected to the positive terminal of the battery and hydrogen bubbles are formed on the other electrode. Changes of colour of solutions may occur depending on what solution and electrodes are used. This process is known as chemical effects of current.

           Activity 7 (NCERT Textbook, Page 177)
           <br/>
           We will need copper sulphate and two copper plates of size around 10 cm x 4 cm. Take 250 ml. of distilled water in a clean and dry beaker. Dissolve two teaspoonfuls of copper sulphate in it. Add a few drops of dilute sulphuric acid to copper sulphate solution to make it more conducting. Clean copper plates with sand paper. Now rinse them with water and dry them. Connect the copper plates to the terminals of a battery and immerse them in copper sulphate solution (Fig. 14.4).
           <br/>
<img alt="NCERT Solutions for Class 8 Science Chapter 14 Chemical Effects of Electric Current Activity 7" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-106855" height="323" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 284px) 100vw, 284px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Science-Chapter-14-Chemical-Effects-of-Electric-Current-Activity-7.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Science-Chapter-14-Chemical-Effects-of-Electric-Current-Activity-7.png 284w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Science-Chapter-14-Chemical-Effects-of-Electric-Current-Activity-7-264x300.png 264w" width="284"/>
<br/>
           Allow the current to pass for about 15 minutes. Now remove the electrodes from the solution and look at them carefully. Do you find any difference in any one of them? Do you find a coating over it? What colour is the coating? Note down the terminal of the battery with which this electrode is connected.
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           After removing the electrodes from the solution, we find that copper metal gets deposited on the plate at the negative of the battery. It is concluded that when electric current is passed through the copper sulphate solution, copper sulphate dissociates into copper and sulphate. The free copper gets deposited on the plate acting as cathode. Gradually, a layer of copper builds up on the plate. This process is known as electroplating.

<br/>
           A tester is used to check the conduction of electricity through two liquids, labelled A and B. It is found that the bulb of the tester glows brightly for liquid A while it glows very dimly for liquid B. You would conclude that
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Liquid A is a better conductor than liquid B.
           </li>
<li>
            Liquid B is a better conductor than liquid A.
           </li>
<li>
            Both liquids are equally conducting.
           </li>

<br/>
           Explain the process of electroplating of copper.
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer:
           </span>
<br/>
           When electric current is passed through copper sulphate solution, the copper sulphate breaks up into copper and sulphate ions. The free copper gets drawn to the plate connected to the negative terminal of the battery and gets deposited on that plate. From the other plate, an equal amount of copper gets dissolved in the solution. The loss of copper from solution is cqmpensated and the process goes on.

            Question 13.
           </span>
<br/>
           Which properties of chromium make it useful for electroplating on iron ? Why we cannot make the whole article with chromium ?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer:
           </span>
<br/>
           Chromium has a good shine, it resists scratches and is corrosion resistant. We cannot make the whole article from it because it is a very costly metal.

            Question 1.
           </span>
<br/>
           What is the basic principle of electric pen ? Explain how it can be used for writing.
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer:
           </span>
<br/>
           Electric charge on ions is used for writing with an electric pen.
           <br/>
           Method :
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Take a filter paper soaked in potassium iodide solution to which a pinch of starch is added.
           </li>
<li>
            Place the filter paper on a metal sheet.
           </li>
<li>
            Connect the negative terminal of battery to the metal sheet.
           </li>
<li>
            Write on the paper with the end of the wire connected to the positive terminal.

</li>
<li>
            The writing appears on the paper. This happens because the when current is passed, the K+ ions are attracted to the metal sheet. The iodide ions (I- ) react with starch to turn blue black.
           </li>
</ul>

            Question 4.
           </span>
<br/>
           What is the difference between current flowing through metals and current flowing through liquids ?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer:
           </span>
<br/>
           In metals electric current is conducted by flow of electrons. In liquids, the movement of charged particles (ions) carry current from anode to cathode terminals. Electrolytes conduct current at a slow rate than metals.
