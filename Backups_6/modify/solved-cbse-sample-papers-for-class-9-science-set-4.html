           Question 6:
           <br/>
           If you are trying to push a heavy box on a horizontal surface, list various forces on the box. State the condition under which this box will start sliding on the surface. How will the magnitude of applied force required to move the box change if:
           <br/>
           (i) weight of the box is increased,
           <br/>
           (ii) the surface on which the box is placed is made more rough ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Various forces acting on the box are :
           <br/>
           (i) Its weight ‘W’ acting vertically downward,
           <br/>
           (ii) reaction force ‘R’ due to horizontal surface,
           <br/>
           (iii) force of push ‘F’ and
           <br/>
           (iv) frictional force ‘f. Forces have been shown in figure.
           <br/>
           The box will start sliding on the surface only if the pushing force F is greater than the frictional force f i.e., F &gt; f.
           <br/>
           (i) If weight of the box is increased, the magnitude of applied force must increase.
           <br/>
           (ii) If the surface is made more rough, the magnitude of applied force must increase.

           <br/>
           answer
           <br/>
           the following :
           <br/>
           (a) When is the maximum force acting on the car ? Why?
           <br/>
           (b) What is the retarding force ?
           <br/>
           (c) For how long is there no force acting ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 9 Science Solved Set 4 7" height="180" loading="lazy" src="https://studygramhome.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/cbse-sample-papers-for-class-9-science-solved-set-4-7.png?w=237" width="237"/>
<br/>
           (a) In the u-t graph the OA part represents uniformly
           <br/>
           accelerated motion with an acceleration \(a=\frac { 15-0 }{ 4 } =3.75m{ s }^{ -2 }\)
           <br/>
           ∴Force in this region is maximum having a value
           <br/>
           F = ma = 1000 × 3.75 = 3750 N
           <br/>
           (b) In the u-t graph the part BC represents uniformly retarded motion with an acceleration
           <br/>
           \(a=\frac { 0-15 }{ 10-8 } =-7.5m{ s }^{ -2 }\)
           <br/>
           ∴Retarding force F = ma = 1000 × (- 7.5) = – 7500 N

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In summer, the temperature is higher. More water molecules get the higher kinetic energy, leave the surface of clothes and move to the atmosphere. Therefore clothes get dry faster in summer.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The activity is performed as under:
           <br/>
           (i) Take a 100 ml_ beaker.
           <br/>
           (ii) Fill half of the beaker with water and mark the level of water with a pen.
           <br/>
           (iii) Dissolve about 5 g of salt into water with the help of a glass rod.
           <br/>
           (iv) Observe the change in level of water.
           <br/>
           We find that there is no change in the level of water in the beaker. That means the particles of salt have occupied the empty spaces between particles of water, so no change in water level has taken place.,
           <br/>
           The activity proves that particles of matter have empty spaces between them.

           is a molecule that contains three atoms of oxygen. Ozone is poisonous but it is not stable near the Earth’s surface. It occurs in the zone of Earth’s atmosphere called stratosphere.
           <br/>
           Ozone absorbs harmful ultraviolet radiations from the Sun. Thus it protects us from certain diseases like cancer.
           <br/>
           Various man-made compounds like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) react with ozone molecule and cause depletion in the ozone layer in the atmosphere.
           <br/>
           Recently a hole in the ozone layer has been discovered above the Antarctica. Due to ozone layer depletion, UV-rays can enter the Earth’s atmosphere and cause certain diseases.

           (iii) List the two values that motivated Kishore to help his parents.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) There are sixteen nutrients essential for plants. Soil supplies thirteen nutrients to plants. Six nutrients which are required in large quantities are called macro or major nutrients. The remaining seven nutrients which are required by plants in small quantities are called micro or minor nutrients.
           <br/>
           Soil can be enriched by supplying these nutrients from external sources as manures and fertilisers.
           <br/>
           (ii) Since legumes are capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen with the help of Rhizobium, they enrich the soil in N2 content. Hence Kishore suggested growing legumes.

           <br/>
           (b) A motorcyclist riding motorcycle A, who is travelling at 36 km h’1, applies the brakes and stops the motorcycle in 10 s. Another motorcyclist of motorcycle B, who is travelling at 18 km h’1, applies the brakes and stops the motorcycle in 20 s. Plot speed-time graphs for the two motorcycles. Which of the two motorcycles travelled farther before it came to a stop ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) It is the direction of velocity of an object which determines the direction of motion of a particle. As an example, let us consider a ball moving in vertically upward direction when projected upward with a finite velocity. In this case, an acceleration due to gravity is acting on the ball in vertically downward direction. However, the direction of motion is vertically upward which is same as the direction of velocity.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Kinetic energy of an object is the energy possessed by it by virtue of its state of motion. Every moving object possesses kinetic energy.
           <br/>
           Consider an object of mass m in a state of motion with an initial velocity u. Let now a constant force
           <br/>
           Facts on it and displaces the body through a distance s in the direction of force applied.
           <br/>
           Work done on the object W = Fs
           <br/>
           Due to the work done on the body, let velocity of the object changes from u to v and a be the acceleration produced.
           <br/>

<br/>
           If the object started from rest, then u = 0 and hence W = 1/2 mv
           <sup>

<br/>
           The work done on the object is equal to the kinetic energy imparted to the object.

           Nitrogen fixation involves the following steps:
           <br/>
           (i) Conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into nitrates and nitrites by nitrogen fixing bacteria which are found in the roots of legumes (plants which give us pulses) or during lightining in the sky.
           <br/>
           (ii) Formation of proteins by plants and animals from nitrates.
           <br/>
           (iii) On decay and death of plants and animals, denitrifying bacteria convert the nitrates back to elemental nitrogen.

           Question 22:
           <br/>
           State two precautions that should be observed while making use of an overflow can, Answer:
           <br/>
           Two important precautions which should be observed while making use of an overflow can are as follows :
           <br/>
           (i) The overflow can should be filled with water until the water begins to flow from its spout. Wait till the last drop of excess wrater flows out. This is to ensure that the level of water in the can is up to its brim.
           <br/>
           (ii) When the given solid object is lowered in the overflow can, the object should not touch the walls or the base of the overflow can.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 23:
           <br/>
           Would you prefer amplitude of the pulse to be small or large ? Why ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           We prefer to keep the amplitude of the pulse appreciably large so that it can get reflected sufficient number of times at the fixed ends of the string/slinky before fading out. In this way, total length covered by the pulse is large and correspondingly time taken by pulse to cover this journey is sufficient and can be measured easily using a stop clock.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Beaker A – Stable Beaker B – Unstable Beaker C – Stable –

           Answer:
           <br/>
           The observable identifying features of dicots are as follows :
           <br/>
           (i) Leaves of dicots exhibit reticulate venation.
           <br/>
           (ii) Presence of pentamerous flowers.
           <br/>
           (iii) Stem is hard, brown and woody due to secondary growth.
           <br/>
           (iv) Seeds of dicot plants can be split into two i.e., they have two cotyledons.

           Question 27:
           <br/>
           A student was asked to prepare a temporary mount of cheek cells which he did but his slide got mixed up with the slide prepared by another student. The other student had prepared a temporary mount of onion peel. Which of the following observation will help him in identifying his slide of cheek cells ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The student can recognise his slide of cheek cell from the slide prepared by another student in following ways :
           <br/>
           (i) Cheek cells are stained by a chemical called methylene blue which colours the tissue blue.
           <br/>
           (ii) Cheek cells are irregular shaped polygonal cells.
           <br/>
           (iii) Cheek cells do not have a rigid cell wall.
