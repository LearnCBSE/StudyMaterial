           Class 11 Political Science Chapter 8 NCERT Textbook Questions Solved
          </h3>
<p>
           Questions 1.
           <br/>
           Constitution of India visualised village panchayats as emits of self-government. Think over the situation described in the following statements and explain how do these situations strengthen or weaken the panchayats in becoming units of self-government.
           <br/>
           (a) Government of a State has allowed a big company to establish a huge steel plant. Many villages would be adversely affected by the steel plant. Gram Sabha of one of the affected villages passed a resolution that before establishing any big industries in the region, village people must be consulted and their grievances should be redressed.
           <br/>
           (b) The government has decided that 20 % of all its expenditure would be done through the panchayats.
           <br/>
           (c) A village panchayat kept on demanding funds for a building for village school, the government officials turned down their proposal saying that funds are allocated for certain other schemes and cannot be spent otherwise.
           <br/>
           (d) The government divided a village Dungarpur into two and made a part of village Jamuna and Sohana. Now village Dungarpur has ceased to exist in government’s books.
           <br/>
           (e) A village panchayat observed that water sources of their region are depleting fast. They decided to mobilise village youth to do some voluntary work and revive the old village ponds and wells.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) This refers that Gram Panchayat was not consulted before the establishment of steel plant, by the state government. This action can weaken the institution of panchayats. The resolution passed by Gram Sabha strengthened the panchayats by giving them right to move to courts against the unilateral move of the state government.
           <br/>
           (b) This decision of state government help the panchayats financially on the ground not to interfere in the decisions and priorities of the panchayats as well as panchayats need independent sources of revenue to operate effectively at the local level.
           <br/>
           (c) This will weaken the Panchayati Raj because these institutions prioritize their developmental agenda themselves and denial for the same weaken them to become a self government.
           <br/>
           (d) If this division has taken place on the recommendations of Panchayati Raj Institutions, it strengthen their powers but if it has been done on its own by the state, it would weaken these institutions.
           <br/>
           (e) This will strengthen the Panchayati Raj Institutions’ respect and power.
          </p>
<p>
           Questions 2.
           <br/>

<ul>
<li>
            Development works at village level, i.e. irrigation facilities, drinking water, construction of roads, etc.
           </li>
<li>

           </li>
<li>

           </li>
<li>

           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Questions 3.
           <br/>
           What are the provisions for the reservations for the socially disadvantaged groups as per the 73rd amendment? Explain how these provisions have changed the profile of the leadership at the village level.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In 1993, two constitutional amendment Acts, were passed to recognise local self-government at the grass-root level. 73rd amendment made the following provisions:
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<ul>
<li>
            The reservation of seats has been made for SCs, STs, OBCs and women.
           </li>
<li>
            Reservation for women at panchayats has ensured the participation of women in local bodies.
           </li>
<li>
            Due to this reservation, a number of women have occupied even the position of Sarpanch and Adhyaksha.
           </li>
<li>
            Hence, more than 80,000 women Sarpanch have been elected so far.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Questions 4.
           <br/>
           What were the main differences between the local governments before 73rd amendment and after that amendment?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Before 73rd Amendment:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Local government was a state subject only.
           </li>
<li>
            States were free to make their own kind of laws in local government.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           After 73rd Amendment:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Local governments have received the recognition as a separate entity in the constitution.
           </li>
<li>
            Elections at every regular interval of five years have been made mandatory.
           </li>
<li>
            The seats have been reserved in favour of SC’s, ST’s, OBC’s and women.
           </li>
<li>
            State Election Commission has been appointed and made responsible to conduct free and fair elections here.
           </li>
<li>
            After every five years, state finance commission has been set up to review the finances of the panchayats and to make recommendations for grants to panchayats.
           </li>
<li>
            The panchayats have been empowered to collect, levy the appropriate taxes, fees, tools as assigned by state government.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Questions 5.
           <br/>
           Read the following conversation. Write in two hundred words your opinion about the issues raised in this conversation.
           <br/>
           Alok: Our Constitution guarantees equality between men and women. Reservations in local bodies for women ensure their equal share in power.
           <br/>
           Neha: But it is not enough that women should be in positions of power. It is necessary that the budget of local bodies should have separate provision for women.
           <br/>
           Jayesh: I don’t like this reservations business. A local body must take care of all people in the village and that would automatically take care of women and their interests.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           This conversation is based on the issue of empowerment of women on equal basis:
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<ul>
<li>
            The constitution of India guarantees the equality of men and women.
           </li>
<li>
            Under Article 15, no citizen can be discriminated on the grounds of colour, race, language and religion, caste, sex, etc.
           </li>
<li>
            Article 39(1) and (d) ensure an adequate livelihood and equal pay for equal work for both men and women respectively.
           </li>
<li>
            Alok views that our constitution guarantees equality between men and women as well as reservations in local bodies also ensure the equal share of power.
           </li>
<li>
            Neha views to have separate provisions of budget to women to improve women’s conditions.
           </li>
<li>
            Jayesh views to provide provisions equally to all people living in village, hence women would automatically be benefited.
           </li>
<li>
            But, if women will be provided to equal access along with men without any reservation, it will not get success at all.
           </li>
<li>
            Without reservation, women will not succeed to the power and to make policies because of male dominant society in India.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Questions 6.
           <br/>
           Read the provisions of the 73rd Amendment. Which of the following concerns does this amendment address?
           <br/>
           (a) Fear of replacement makes representatives accountable to the people.
           <br/>
           (b) The dominant castes and feudal landlords dominate the local bodies.
           <br/>
           (c) Rural illiteracy is very high. Illiterate people cannot take decisions about the development of the village.
           <br/>
           (d) To be effective the village panchayats need resources and powers to make plans for the village development.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) After 73rd Amendment Act, 1993:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            It is mandatory to hold elections after every five years.
           </li>
<li>
            If the state government dissolves the panchayats before the completion of term, fresh elections must take place within six months.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           (b) Reservation for SCs, STs, and women have been provided.
           <br/>
           The women have reservation of 1/3 seats in local bodies.
           <br/>
           SCs and STs have been given proportion accordingly to their population of that particular area.
           <br/>
           Hence, dominance of feudal lords and dominant classes has come to an end.
          </p>
<p>
           (c)  In the eleventh schedule of the constitution, 29 subjects have been given to localbodies in 1992.
           <br/>
           Primary and secondary education is the part of this list to make the people literate in village.
           <br/>
           The state government would shoulder the responsibility. .
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           (d) The panchayats have been given powers to levy, collect taxes, duties and fees according to state government’s provision.
           <br/>
           The provisions for the establishment of a state finance commission have also been made to review the finances of panchayats and to make recommendations also.
          </p>
<p>
           Questions 7.
           <br/>
           The following are different justifications given in favour of local government. Give them ranking and explain why you attach greater significance to a particular rationale than the others. According to you, on which of these rationales the decision of the Gram panchayat of Vengaivasal village was based? How?
           <br/>

           Passage 1.
           <br/>
           Read the passage (NCERT Textbook, page 191) given below carefully and answer the questions that follows:
          </p>
<p>
           The Constitutional amendments assigned as many as 29 subjects to the local governments. All these subjects are related to functions linked to local welfare and development needs. The experience with the functioning of local government in the past decade has shown that local governments in India enjoy limited autonomy to perform the functions assigned to them. Many States have not transferred most of the subjects to the local bodies. This means that the local bodies cannot really function in an effective manner. Therefore, the entire exercise of electing so many representatives becomes somewhat symbolic. Some people criticise the formation of the local bodies because this has not changed the way in which decisions are taken at the central and the State level. People at the local level do not enjoy much powers of choosing welfare programmes or allocation of resources.
          </p>
<p>
           Questions:
           <br/>
           1. How many subjects have been assigned to local governments?
           <br/>
           2. What is the main theme of these subjects?
           <br/>
           3. How can we say that local government enjoy limited autonomy only?
           <br/>
           4. On what grounds, the formation of local bodies have been criticised?
           <br/>
           Answers:
           <br/>
           1. 29 subjects have been assigned to local governments.
          </p>
<p>
           2. These subjects are related to functions linked to local welfare and development needs.
          </p>
<p>
           3. Because many states have not transferred most of the subjects to the local bodies. Hence, many representatives become symbolic only.
          </p>
<p>
           4. Because, the decisions taking methods have not been changed at the central and state level. So the people at local level do not enjoy much powers of choosing welfare programmes or allocation of resources.

           Passage 2.
           <br/>
           Read the passage (NCERT Textbook, page 186) given below carefully and answer the questions that follows:
          </p>
<p>
           The State government is required to appoint a State Election Commissioner who would be responsible for conducting elections to the Panchayati Raj institutions. Earlier, this task was performed by the State administration which was under the control of the State government. Now, the office of the State Election Commissioner is autonomous like the Election Commissioner of India. However, the State Election Commissioner is an independent officer and is not linked to nor is this officer under the control of the Election Commission of India.

           Answers:
           <br/>

          </p>
