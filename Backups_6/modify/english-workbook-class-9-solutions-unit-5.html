           <br/>
           There are many different ways of classifying connectors according to their meaning. We shall’start with the ones you are already familiar with.

<strong>
            Martin’s Picture
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           Margin wasn’t a very bright boy.
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            Normally,
           </span>
           he never came more than second from the bottom in any test.
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            But,
           </span>
           that morning in the art lesson, he had drawn a beautiful picture of a scarecrow in a field of yellow corn.
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            To his astonishment,
           </span>
           the drawing was the only one given full marks – ten out of ten – which made him for the first time in his life the best in the class! He had proudly pinned the picture up on the wall behind his desk, where it could be admired by all. It seemed
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            though,
           </span>
           that not everyone admired it. Some unknown member of the class had, in fact, taken a violent dislike to it.
          </p>
<p>
           During the lunch break, when the classroom had been deserted, the picture had been torn off the wall.
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            Moreover,
           </span>
           it had been trodden or stamped on.
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            As if that wasn’t enough,
           </span>
           the words ‘ROTTEN RUBBISH’ had been written on the back in big round letters.
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            And finally,
           </span>
           the paper was so creased that it looked as though it had been screwed up into a tight ball and perhaps thrown about the room.
          </p>

           “Who could have done it?” Martin wondered.
