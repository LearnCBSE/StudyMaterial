             Strategies for Enhancement in Food Production Important Questions for CBSE Class 12 Biology Animal Husbandry
            </strong>
</span>
</h2>
<p>
<strong>
            1.Animal husbandry
           </strong>
           is the agricultural practice of breeding and raising livestock. It deals with the care and breeding of livestock like buffaloes, cows, pigs, horses, cattle, sheep, goat, etc. It also includes poultry farming and fisheries. More than 70%*of the world’s livestock population is in India and China. Many new teclsncdogies have also been applied to achieve improvement in quality and productivity.
          </p>
<p>
           2. Methods to improve quality and quantity in animal husbandry are:
           <br/>
<strong>
            I. Management of Farms and Farm Animals
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            (i) Dairy farm management
           </strong>
           is the management of animals for milk and its products for human consumption.
           <br/>
           (a) It deals with processes and systems to improve quality and quantity of milk.
           <br/>
           (b) Milk yield depends mainly on the quality of breeds in the farm.
           <br/>
           (c) Dairy farm management processes include:
           <br/>
           • Selection of good breeds having high yielding potential and resistance to the
           <br/>
           diseases.
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Cattle should be housed-well, should have sufficient water and should be kept in disease-free conditions.
           </li>
<li>
            They should be fed in a scientific manner, with good quality and quantity of fodder.
           </li>
<li>
            Stringent cleanliness and hygiene ©f both the cattle and thehandler* are very important, during milking, storage and transport of milk and its products.
           </li>
<li>
            Regular inspection and keeping proper records of ail the activities of’dairyis also mandatory.
           </li>
<li>
            Regular visits of a veterinary doctor is necessary.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
            (ii) Poultry farm management
           </strong>
           includes the management of poultry which i&amp; the class of domesticated fowl (birds) used for food or for their eggs. It includes chicken, ducks, Turkey and geese.
           <br/>
           The poultry farm management includes following processes:
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<ul>
<li>
            Selection of disease-free and suitable poultry breeds.
           </li>
<li>
            Housing should be proper and safe.
           </li>
<li>
            Proper food and water should be provided.
           </li>
<li>
            Health care and hygiene of poultry is mandatory.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
            II.
           </strong>
           Bee-keeping or apiculture is the maintenance of hives of honeybees for the large
           <br/>
           scale production of honey and beewax. The excessive demand of honey for its nutritive value and bees wax for cosmetics, etc., led to the large scale bee-keeping practices. Bee-keeping can be practiced in any area, where there are sufficient bee pastures of wild shrubs, fruit orchards and cultivated crops. It is not labour-intensive.
           <br/>
           There are several species of honeybees, but most common species reared by bee-keepers is Apis indica.
           <br/>
           The important points for successful bee-keeping are:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Knowledge of the nature and habits of bees.
           </li>
<li>
            Selection of suitable location for keeping the beehives.
           </li>
<li>
            Catching and hiving of swarms (group of bees).
           </li>
<li>
            Management of beehives during different seasons.
           </li>
<li>
            Handling and collection of honey and beeswax.
           </li>
<li>
            Keeping beehives in crop fields such as sunflower, Brassica, apple and pear during following period increases pollination efficiency and improves the yield,both crop yield and honey yield.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
            III. Fishery
           </strong>
           is an industry, which includes catching, processing or selling of fish, shellfish and other aquatic animals like prawn, crab, lobster, edible oyster, etc…
           <br/>
           (i) The common freshwater fishes are catla, rohu and common carp.
           <br/>
           (ii) Some of the marine fishes that are eaten include Hilsa, Sardines, Mackerel and
           <br/>
           pomfrets.
           <br/>
           (iii) Fisheries provides income and employment to millions of fishermen and farmers,
           <br/>
           especially in coastal states in Indian economy.
           <br/>
           (iv) To meet the increasing demand on fisheries, different techniques like aquaculture and pisciculture are applied.
           <br/>
           (v)
           <strong>
            Blue revolution
           </strong>
           is the movement launched to increase the production of fish and fish products. It is being implemented in the same lines as
           <strong>
            green revolution.
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
            IV. Animal breeding
           </strong>
           is an important part of animal husbandry. It aims to increase the yield of animals and improve the desirable qualities of produce.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
             A breed
            </strong>
            is a group of animals related by descent and similar in most characters like general appearance, features, size, configuration, etc.
           </li>
<li>
            Breeding can be divided as given iii the chart below:
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
<img alt="important-questions-for-class-12-biology-cbse-animal-husbandry-image 1jpg_Page1" height="192" loading="lazy" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5702/23273033165_6fd5505b62_o.jpg" width="667"/>
<br/>
<strong>
            (a) Inbreeding
           </strong>
           refers to the mating between closely related individuals within the same breed for 4-6 generations.
           <br/>
           The strategies for inbreeding are as follow:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Identifying
            <strong>
             superior males
            </strong>
            and
            <strong>
             females
            </strong>
            of the same breed. They are mated in pairs.
           </li>
<li>
            Evaluation of progeny obtained from the above mating to identify superior males and females among them.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             A superior female
            </strong>
            , in case of cattle, is the cow or buffalo that produces more milk per lactation. A superior male is bull, which gives rise to superior progeny as compared to other males.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Effects of inbreeding are:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            It is used to evolve a pureline (inbreeding increases homozygosity).
           </li>
<li>
            Harmful recessive genes are exposed by inbreeding, which are then eliminated by the selection.
           </li>
<li>
            Superior genes can be accumulated by inbreeding, the undesirable genes.
           </li>
<li>
            Productivity of inbreed population is increased by selection at every step.
           </li>
<li>
            Continued inbreeding reduces fertility and even productivity. This is called
            <strong>
             inbreeding depression
            </strong>
            .
           </li>
<li>
            In this case, selected animals of the breeding population are mated with unrelated superior animals of the same breed. This helps to restore fertility and yield.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
            (b) Outbreeding
           </strong>
           is the breeding of unrelated animals, either of the same breed but not having common ancestors for 4-6 generations (out-crossing) or of different breeds (cross-breeding) or even different species (interspecific hybridisation).
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           It can be of the following types:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
             Out-crossing
            </strong>
            is the practice of mating of animals, within the same breed, but having no common ancestors on either side of their pedigree up to 4-6 generations.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           -The offspring of such mating is called an out-cross.
          </p>
<p>
           -It is done to increase milk production, growth rate in cattle’s beef, etc.
           <br/>
           -A single out cross helps to overcome inbreeding depression
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
             Cross-breeding
            </strong>
            refers to the mating of superior males of one breed with superior females of another breed.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           -It helps in accumulate desirable qualities of two breeds into progeny.
          </p>
<p>
           -The progeny may be used for commercial production themselves.
           <br/>
           -A new sheep breed, Hisardale is developed in Punjab by crossing Bikaneri Ewes and Marino Rams.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
             Interspecific hybridisation
            </strong>
            refers to crossing between male and female animals of two different related species.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           -Progeny may combine desirable features of both the parents.

           It is of following types:
           <br/>
<strong>
            (i) Out-crossing
           </strong>
           It is a practice of mating of animals of same breeds, having no common ancestors on either side of their pedigree for 4-6 generations.
           <br/>
           A single out cross helps to overcome inbreeding depressions.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (ii) Cross-breeding
           </strong>
           In this method, superior male of one breed are mated with superior females of another breed.
           <br/>
           This helps in combining the desirable qualities of two different breeds into the progeny.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (iii) Interspecific hybridisation
           </strong>
           In this method, male and female animals of two different related species are mated to combine the desirable features of both the parents into one, e.g. Mule is produced by a cross between male donkey and female horse.

           Advantages of inbreeding are:
           <br/>
           (a) It increases and evolves a pureline.
           <br/>
           (b) Recessive genes are exposed by inbreeding, which are then eliminated by selection.
           <br/>
           (c) Superior genes can be accumulated by inbreeding and thereby eliminating undesirable genes.
           <br/>
           (d) By selection at every step, productivity of inbreed population is increased. Disadvantage of inbreeding is that close inbreeding leads to the reduction of fertility and productivity. This is due to inbreeding depression.

<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
<strong>
            Advantages of inbreeding in cattle population are:
           </strong>
<br/>
           (i) It increases homozygosity, hence evolve a pureline.
           <br/>
           (ii) It helps in the accumulation of superior genes and elimination of less desirable genes.
           <br/>
           (iii) It exposes harmful recessive genes and their elimination by selection.
           <br/>
           Effects of inbreeding depression are:
           <br/>
           (i) When continued over a long period of time, it reduces the fertility and over productivity of animals.
           <br/>
           (ii) Inbreeding depression can be overcome by out-crossing, i.e. mating of selected animals with unrelated superior animals  of same breed. It helps to restore the fertility and yield in the cattle.

<strong>
            Advantages of out-crossing
           </strong>
<br/>
           (i) It is the best method for animals that are below average in productivity in milk production, growth rate, etc. It helps to overcome inbreeding depression.
           <br/>
<strong>
            Advantages of cross-breeding
           </strong>
<br/>
           (i) It allows the desirable qualities of two different breeds to be combined in a single progeny.
           <br/>
           (ii) Progeny may be used for commercial production.
           <br/>
           (iii) Many new breeds have been developed by this approach, i.e. Hisardale.

<br/>
           Limitations of Inbreeding Thecontinued inbreeding in animals forsubsequent generations reduces theirfertility and productivity, resulting in condition called inbreeding depression.
           <br/>
           The inbreeng depression can be overcome by a single outcross, i.e. mating between animals of same breed having no common ancestors up to 4-6 generations.
           <br/>
           (iii) An example of new breed of cattle   is Hisardale and that of poultry is new hampshire.
