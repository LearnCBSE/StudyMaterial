<ol>
<li>
            The boy couldn’t pay the school fees on the day he brought to school because the teacher Master Ghulam Mohammed was on leave.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             (i)
            </strong>
            The coins in the boy’s pocket urged him to buy hot and fresh jalebis.
            <br/>
<strong>
             (ii)
            </strong>
            Yes, the coins were misguiding him because the money was meant for paying school fees.
           </li>
<li>
            Initially, the boy didn’t take the advice of the coins seriously for a couple of rea­sons. He could not spend the money meant for paying school fees on jalebis. Sec­ondly, the boy knew the harsh nature of the master and the punishment.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             (i)
            </strong>
            The oldest coin convinced him that they were telling him for his own good. He can pay his fee next day with his scholarship money. So he should not suppress his desire for jalebis. .
            <br/>
<strong>
             (ii)
            </strong>
            He didn’t follow his advice. He was a promising student. He was from a good family of repute. He didn’t want to get defame for it
           </li>
<li>
            After reaching home he couldn’t suppress his temptation for fresh Jalabis. He rushed to the shop of halwai. He bought jalebis and enjoyed them.
           </li>

<li>
<strong>
             (i)
            </strong>
            He had bought jalebis for one rupee. But he couldn’t eat all of them because of their quantity.
            <br/>
<strong>
             (ii)
            </strong>
            He distributed the remaining jalebis among the boys from the neighbourhood.
           </li>
<li>
            He had eaten so many jalebis that there was the problem of digesting them all. His fear was that one jalebi or two would come out with a burp.
           </li>
<li>
            It means that children have the capacity to digest a lot of things that they overeat. I agree with the statement but only partly.
           </li>
<li>
            He planned to pay the fees the next day when he would get his monthly scholarship.
           </li>
<li>
            When the time draws near to pay the fees, he tucked the bag under his arm and slips out of the school. He had disobeyed his elders by crossing the railway track.

<li>
            What was the consequence of buying jalebis with the fees money?
           </li>
<li>
            His prayer to God is like a lawyer’s defence of a bad case. Does he argue his case well? What are the points he makes?

            He offers to play a game with Allah Miyan. What is the game?

            Did he get four rupees by playing the game? What did he get to see under the rock?

</p>
<ol>
<li>
            As a result of spending his fees money on jalebis, he had to be absent from school for the first time in his life.
           </li>
<li>
            He tries to please God with his requests and the recitation of the entire
            <em>
             namaz.
            </em>
            He admits that he made a mistake. He wouldn’t have spent his money on jalebis if he had known about the delay in scholarship. Thus, he argues his case like a lawyer.
           </li>
<li>
            The game is that he will go upto the signal, touch it and come back. And in the meantime God should put four rupees under a big rock.
           </li>
<li>
            No, he didn’t get four rupees by playing the game. When he lifted the rock, he saw a worm instead of coins.
           </li>
<li>
            If God had granted his wish that day he wouldn’t have learnt a lesson to do no wrong in future. He would have been like a bird and learnt no skill.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
<strong>
            (a)
           </strong>
           The boy is definitely intelligent. The first evidence is that he has won a schol­arship. He is a promising boy. He knows what is right and what is wrong. He argues his case before God like a lawyer.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (b)
           </strong>
           Yes, his outlook changed after class VIII. He later realised that nothing comes without a price. If God were to grant all one’s wishes for the asking, man would not learn any skill. He would be no better than birds.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (c)
           </strong>
           The coins are made to talk because they reflect the conflict going on in his own mind.

             Question 1:

<br/>
</strong>
           How did the coins persuade the boy to buy
           <em>
            jalebis

<br/>
           The coins told the boy that the
           <em>
            jalebis
           </em>
           were fresh, crisp and syrupy. They were meant to be eaten and only those with money in their pocket could eat them.

             Question 2:

           How did the boy respond to the coins?

<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
             Answer:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           The boy didn’t heed to the coins. He was a good and intelligent boy. He told the coins not to misguide him. He got so much at home that he considered even looking at something in the
           <em>
            bazaar
           </em>
           a sin.

             Question 3:

             Answer:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           All the four coins began to speak at the same time in order to make the boy ready to buy the jalebis. There was such a clamour that passersby in the bazaar stared at him and his pocket. So, the boy grabbed all of them and held them tight in his fist to make them silent.

</span>
<br/>
           As soon as he reached the school, he came to know that the scholarship was going to be paid the following month. This news intensified his tension so much that his head started to spin.

<br/>
<em>
            Jalebis
           </em>
           are central to the story. These are hot, fresh and syrupy. A school boy falls to the sweet temptation of jalebis. He spends all his school fees money in buying
           <em>
            jalebis
           </em>
           . He eats himself and also distributes them among children. He regrets his weakness later. He prays to God to send him four rupees. But he gets no help from God. He realises in later life that God cannot meet everybody’s demand. Were he so generous, man would not have developed the skill of making jalebis.

           The schoolboy in the story
           <em>
            Jalebis
           </em>
           carries four rupees to school to pay the school fees. He is honest, God fearing and brilliant student. He has won a scholarship also. He has never been punished. He enjoys prestige. He feels shy of standing in the bazaar and eating
           <em>
            jalebis
           </em>
           . But the coins in his pocket persuade him to go wrong. And he repents his foolishness. He asks for God’s help. He can recite the
           <em>
            namaz
           </em>
           and some portions from the Quran. His experience, however, teaches him a valuable lesson.

             Answer:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           The schoolboy faces a crisis after he has spent his school fees on the jalebis. He turns to
           <em>
            Allah Miyan
           </em>
           for help. He apologises to God. He promises to never repeat that mistake, and recites the
           <em>
            namaaz
           </em>
           and few verses from the Quran. He hopes in vain that God will put money under the rock. He plays a game with God. But he finds no coins but a hairy worm under the rock.
