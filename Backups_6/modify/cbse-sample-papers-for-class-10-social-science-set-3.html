           <br/>
           (iii) Education is included in Concurrent List as the Indian Constitution has provisions to ensure that the state provides education to all its citizens. Education being a concurrent list subject enables the Central Government to legislate it in the manner suited to it.

           </li>
<li>
            The Dutch-speaking community got the benefit of economic development and education much later than the French-speaking community.
           </li>
<li>
            This led to conflict between the Dutch-speaking and French-speaking communities during the 1950s and 1960s.
           </li>
<li>
            There was a great social disparity between Dutch and French-speaking communities during the 1950s and 1960s.

           Question 27.
           <br/>
           Rahul wants to grow wheat, jowar, and brinjal on his land. However, these crops are grown in different cropping seasons. In this context, what are the cropping seasons in India? (3)
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Why is subsistence agriculture still practiced in certain parts of the country? Give three reasons.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           India has three cropping seasons. These are as follows Rabi Season These crop are sown in winter from October to December and harvested from April to June.
          </p>
<p>
           Kharif Season These crops are sown with the onset of monsoon (June-July) in different parts of the country and are harvested in September-October.
          </p>
<p>
           Zaid Season It comes in between the Rabi and Kharif seasons. It is a short season during the summer months.
           <br/>
           Or
          </p>
<p>
           The three reasons why subsistence agriculture is still practiced are
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Plots of land are fragmented and small, so large-scale farming cannot be done.
           </li>
<li>
            A large number of family members in rural areas depend on agriculture which makes it necessary to grow crops for self-consumption.
           </li>
<li>
            Poor farmers do not have the resources to buy better inputs like fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation, facilities, and other modern means.
           </li>
</ul>

           Question 29.
           <br/>
           Why did the Non-Cooperation Movement gradually slow down in cities? Explain two reasons. (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Non-Cooperation Movement in the cities gradually slowed down for the following reasons
           <br/>
           (i) Khadi cloth was often more expensive than mass-produced mill cloth and poor people could not afford to buy it. Thus, a boycott of foreign goods could not continue for long.
           <br/>
           (ii) Similarly, the boycott of British institutions posed a problem. No alternative institutions were set up in their place. So, the students, teachers, lawyers, and other professionals finally had to resume their studies and jobs in government institutions like schools, and colleges. courts, etc.

           Question 31.
           <br/>
           Is it right that the national development of a country depends on the availability of public facilities? State the utilities of any two public facilities available in India.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Shruti has a development goal of earning enough income to avail of facilities. However, Deepti has a goal give her equal respect in society as she is an Adivasi. In this context, give examples to prove that there are other important developmental goals other than income. (5)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           It is right that the national development of a country depends on the availability of public facilities. Public facilities are those provided by the government. They may be either highly subsidized or free of cost for the people.
          </p>
<p>
           The utilities of two public facilities available in India are
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            The Public Distribution System (PDS) provides fair average quality of foodgrains and other essential items to the weaker sections of the population at subsidized price.
           </li>
<li>
            Health care in government hospitals and dispensaríes is provided to all at subsidized rates. This includes outpatient as well as hospitalization facilities.
            <br/>
            Or
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Besides income, the developmental goals of various categories of people are different from person to person. Some examples of developmental goals other than income are For rich farmers, development means higher support price for crops, cheap labour and subsidized inputs.
          </p>
<p>
           For; landless rural labourer, development means more days of work, schools for their children and no social discrimination.
           <br/>
           For Adivasi, development means no social discrimination, year-round, school education for children, and PDS shop in his village.

           Question 32.
           <br/>
           Why has Federalism succeeded in India? Which were the policies adopted by India that ensured this success? Explain. [5]
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           The State Governments are required to share some powers and revenue with Local Government Bodies.
           <br/>
           Given the above statement explain any five features of the Panchayati Raj system in India.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Federalism has succeeded in India due to the nature of democratic policies in our country.
           <br/>
           The policies adopted by India to ensure this success are:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Linguistic States: After Independence, the boundaries of several old states were changed to create new states. The creation of Linguistic State is the first and a major test fdr democratic policies in our country.
           </li>
<li>
            Language Policy: The second test for the Indian Federation is the language policy. The Indian Constitution did not give the status of National Language to any one of the languages.
           </li>
<li>
            Centre-State Relations: Restructuring the Centre-State relations is one more way in which Federalism has been strengthened in practice.
           </li>
<li>
            Decentralisation of Power: Power in India has been decentralised to the local government. The local government includes Panchayats in villages and municipalities in Urban areas.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           OR
          </p>
<p>
           Rural local government is known as Panchyati Raj.
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Panchayati Raj Institution is rural based.
           </li>
<li>
            Each village has Gram Panchayat.
           </li>
<li>
            It has Panchs and a Sarpanch.
           </li>
<li>
            He/She is directly elected by the adult population living in the village.
           </li>
<li>
            Panchayat works under the gram Sabha.
           </li>
<li>
            All the voters meet at least twice or thrice in a year.
           </li>
<li>
            Few Gram Panchayats form Panchayat Samiti or Block or Mandol.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Question 33.
           <br/>
           “Democracy is much superior than any other form of government in promoting dignity and freedom of the individuals”. Justify this statement by providing suitable examples.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Can we judge democracy by its outcome? Explain. (5)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In our society, every individual wants to receive respect from fellow beings. In this respect, democratic form of government stands much superior to any other form of government in promoting dignity and freedom of the individual.
          </p>
<p>
           The following points support the given statement Often conflict arises among individuals because some feel that they are not treated with equal respect in comparison to others. It is very common in non-democratic countries. But ¡n democracy, respect, and freedom are the basis of it. Democracy throughout the world has recognised this atleast in principle.
          </p>
<p>
           Most societies were historically male-dominated. The status of women was not satisfactory. After long struggles by women, democracy throughout the world has recognised equal treatment and respect to women at least in principles, In democracy, it becomes easier for women to wage a struggle against what is now unacceptable legally and morally for them.
          </p>
<p>
           Democracy in India has strengthened the claims of the disadvantaged and discriminated castes for equal status and opportunity, which is not possible in any non-democratic country.
          </p>
<p>
           Value Points
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            For getting maximum marks, following value points can be included in the answer
           </li>
<li>
            Mention about equal respect for every one individual in democracy.
           </li>
<li>
            Mention about equal treatment to women in democracy.
           </li>
<li>
            Mention about equal status and opportunity to discriminated castes in democracy.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Or
           <br/>
           Democracy should be judged by its outcome because it opens the path of expectations which is one of the criteria for judging any democratic country.
          </p>
<p>
           The following points justify the above statement
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            The examination procedure of democracy is eternal, as it passes one test, it produces another test.
           </li>
<li>
            It automatically gives rise to expectations as well as complaints by the people when they want to know about the functioning of democracy.
           </li>
<li>
            The fact that people also complain about democracy indicates the awareness and the ability of people to expect and to look critically at power holders and the high and the mighty.
           </li>
<li>
            It transforms people from the status of a subject into that of a citizen.
           </li>
<li>
            Most individuals today believe that their vote makes a difference to the way the government is run and to their self-interest.

           Question 34.
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow: [4]
           <br/>
           Many activities are undertaken by directly using natural resources. When we produce a good by exploiting natural resources, it is an activity of the primary sector. Since most of the natural products we get are from agriculture, dairy, fishing, and forestry, this sector is also called agriculture and related sectors.
          </p>
<p>
           The secondary sector covers activities in which natural products are changed into other forms through ways of manufacturing that we associate with industrial activity. It is the next step after primary. The product is not produced by nature but has to be made and therefore some process of manufacturing is essential. After primary and secondary, there is a third category of activities that falls under tertiary sector and is different from the above two.
          </p>
<p>
           These are activities that help in the development of the primary and secondary sectors. These activities, by themselves, do not produce a good but they are an aid or a support for the production process. The various production activities in the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors produce a very large number of goods and services. Also, the three sectors have a large number of people working in them to produce these goods and services.
          </p>
<p>
           The value of final goods and services produced in each sector during a particular year provides the total production of the sector for that year. And the sum of production in the three sectors gives what is called the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of a country. It is the value of all final goods and services produced within a country during a particular year. GDP shows how big the economy is.
          </p>
<p>
           34.1 Production of a commodity, mostly through ways of manufacturing is an activity of which sector? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The secondary sector of the economy is an economic sector that describes the role of manufacturing. It encompasses industries that produce a finished, usable product or are involved in construction
          </p>
<p>
           34.2 State one example of tertiary sector. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Transport is an example of tertiary activity.
          </p>
<p>
           34.3 Why is secondary sector called industrial? [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Secondary sector is also called industrial because the secondary sector is mostly associated with industries. For example, textile industry, steel industry, etc.

           Question 35.
           <br/>
           Read the source given below and answer the questions that follow.
           <br/>
           On 13th April the infamous Jallianwala Bagh incident took place. On that day, a large crowd gathered in the enclosed ground at Jallianwala Bagh. Some came to protest against the government’s new repressive measures. Others had come to attend the annual Baisakhi fair. Being from outside the city, many villagers were unaware of the martial law that had been imposed. Dyer
           <br/>
           entered the area, blocked the exit points, and opened fire on the crowd, killing hundreds. His object as he declared later, was to ‘produce a moral effect’, to create in the minds of Satyagrahis a feeling of terror and awe.
          </p>
<p>
           As the news of Jallianwala Bagh spread, crowds took to the streets in many North Indian towns. There were strikes, clashes with the police, and attacks on government buildings. The government responded with brutal repression, seeking to humiliate and terrorize people. Satyagrahis were forced to rub their noses on the ground, crawl on the streets, and do salam to all sahibs; people were flogged and villages (around Gujranwala in Punjab, now in Pakistan) were bombed. Seeing violence spread, Mahatma Gandhi called off the movement.
          </p>
<p>
           (i) Why did General Dyer open fire on the peaceful gathering at Jallianwala Bagh on 13th April 1919? Why Martial Law was imposed in Amritsar?
           <br/>
           (ii) What were the effects of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre? (4)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           General Dyer opened fire on the peaceful gathering at Jailianwala Bagh because Martial Law was imposed in Amritsar instead of which people were gathered there.
           <br/>
           Martial Law was imposed in Amritsar because local leaders were picked up from Amritsar and Mahatma Gandhi was not allowed to enter Delhi.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) The effects of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre were There were strikes, clashes with the police and attacks on the government buildings. The government took repressive measures and forced Satyagrahis to rub their noses on the ground.

           Question 36.
           <br/>
           Read the extract given below and answer the questions that follow: [4]
           <br/>
           India had a very rich and old tradition of manuscripts- in Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, as well as in various vernacular languages. Manuscripts were copied on palm leaves Or on handmade paper. Pages were sometimes beautifully illustrated. They would be either pressed wooden covers or sewn together to ensure preservation.
          </p>

           Manuscripts continued to be produced well after the introduction of print, down to the late nineteenth century. Manuscripts, however, were highly expensive and fragile. They had to be handled carefully, and they could not be read easily as the script was written in different styles. So manuscripts were not widely used in everyday life.
          </p>
<p>
           Even though pre-colonial Bengal had developed an extensive network of village primary schools, students very often did not read texts. They only learnt to write. Teachers dictated portions of texts from memory and students wrote them down. Many thus became literate without ever actually reading any kinds of texts.
