<strong>
             Human ReproductionÂ Important Questions for CBSE Class 12 Biology Gametogenesis
            </strong>

</h2>
<p>
<strong>
            1.Gametogenesis
           </strong>
           is the process of producing gametes (sperms and ova by the testis and ovary, respectively).
           <br/>
           It is of the following two types:
           <br/>
           (i)Spermatogenesis
           <br/>
           (ii)Oogenesis
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            2.Spermatogenesis
           </strong>
           is production of sperms in males.
           <br/>
           (i) In testis, the immature male germ cells (spermatogonia) produce sperms by
           <strong>
            spermatogenesis
           </strong>
           that begins at puberty.
           <br/>
           (ii)
           <strong>
            Spermatogonia
           </strong>
           (sing, spermatogonium) present on the inside wall of seminiferous tubules multiply by mitotic division and increase in numbers.
           <br/>
           (iii) Each spermatogonium is diploid and contains 46 chromosomes. Some of the spermatogonia called
           <strong>
            primary spermatocytes
           </strong>
           periodically undergo meiosis.
           <br/>
<img alt="important-questions-for-class-12-biology-cbse-gametogenesis-t-32-1" height="297" loading="lazy" src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/566/22948165529_c4c51631b8_o.png" width="429"/>
<br/>
           (iv)A primary spermatocyte undergo first meiotic division leading to two equal, haploid cells called
           <strong>
            secondary
           </strong>
<strong>
            spermatocytes
           </strong>
           , which contains only 23 chromosomes each.
           <br/>
           (v)The secondary spermatocytes undergo the second meiotic division to produce four equal, haploid
           <strong>
            spermatids.
           </strong>
<br/>
           (vi) The spermatids are transformed into spermatozoa (sperms) by the process called
           <strong>
            spermiogenesis.
           </strong>
<br/>
           (vii) Sperm heads are embedded in the Sertoli cells and are finally released from the seminiferous tubules by the process called
           <strong>
            spermiation
           </strong>
           .
           <br/>
<img alt="important-questions-for-class-12-biology-cbse-gametogenesis-t-32-2" height="396" loading="lazy" src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/704/23289964726_43e762bc15_o.png" width="662"/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
            3.Role of Hormones in Spermatogenesis
           </strong>
<br/>
           (i)Spermatogenesis starts during puberty with the significant increase in hypothalamic hormone called Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH).
           <br/>
           (ii)The increased level of GnRH acts on the anterior pituitary gland and stimulates the secretion of two gonadotropins, i.e. LH (Luteinising Hormone) and FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone).
           <br/>
           (iii) LH acts on the Leydig cells and stimulating the synthesis and secretion of androgens. Androgens in turn stimulate the process of spermatogenesis.
           <br/>
           (iv) FSH acts on Sertoli cells and stimulates the secretion of some factors, which help in the process of spermiogenesis.

<strong>
            4.Structure of a Sperm
           </strong>
<br/>
           (i)A sperm is composed of a head, neck, a middle piece and a tail.
           <br/>
           (ii)A plasma membrane encloses the whole body of sperm.
           <br/>
           (iii)Head contains an elongated haploid nucleus, the anterior portion of which is covered by a cap-like structure called acrosome.
           <br/>
           (iv)The acrosome is filled with enzymes that help in fertilisation of the ovum.
           <br/>
<img alt="important-questions-for-class-12-biology-cbse-gametogenesis-t-32-3" height="350" loading="lazy" src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/645/22948165189_78c3fc1ee9_o.png" width="437"/>
<br/>
           (v)Neck contains two centrioles, a proximal centriole which is necessary for first cleavage division of zygote and a distal centriole, that gives rise to axial filament of tail
           <br/>
           (vi)Middle piece possesses many mitochondria to produce energy for the movement of tail to facilitate sperm motility.
           <br/>
           (vii)Tail of the sperm consists of an axial filament. Its role is to help movement inside the female reproductive tract towards the ovum for fertilisation.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            5.Oogenesis
           </strong>
           is the process of formation of a female gamete or ova in the ovary.
           <br/>
           (i)It starts during embryonic stage in a female.
           <br/>
           (ii)About a million oogonia are formed in the ovary of the female foetus (of 25 weeks). No new oogonia are formed after birth.
           <br/>
           (iii)The oogonial cells start meiotic division, enter into prophase-I, get temporarily arrested at that stage and are called as primary oocytes.
           <br/>
           (iv)Each primary oocyte then gets surrounded by a layer of granulosa cells calledÂ primary follicle.
           <br/>
           (v)A large number of primary follicles degenerate during the phase from birth to puberty. As a result, about 60,000-80,000 primary follicles are left in each ovary at puberty.
           <br/>
<img alt="important-questions-for-class-12-biology-cbse-gametogenesis-t-32-4" height="275" loading="lazy" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5674/23316066085_416a66b33d_o.png" width="423"/>
<br/>
<img alt="important-questions-for-class-12-biology-cbse-gametogenesis-t-32-5" height="380" loading="lazy" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5731/22688958323_7fd7152468_o.png" width="850"/>
<br/>
           (vi)The primary follicles get surrounded by more layers of granulosa cells and a new theca and are called
           <strong>
            secondary follicles.
           </strong>
<br/>
           (vii)The thecal layer in secondary follicles become organised into an outer theca externa and an inner theca interna. This stage is called
           <strong>
            tertiary follicle.
           </strong>
<br/>
           (viii)Tertiary follicle is characterised by a fluid-filled cavity called
           <strong>
            antrum.
           </strong>
<br/>
           (ix)At this stage, the primary oocyte within the tertiary follicle grows in size and completes its first meiotic division.
           <br/>
           (x)The first meiotic division which is unequal results in the formation of haploid
           <strong>
            secondary oocyte
           </strong>
           and tiny first polar body.
           <br/>
           (xi)Secondary oocyte retains bulk of the nutrient rich cytoplasm of the primary oocyte.
           <br/>
           (xii)The tertiary follicle develops into a mature follicle or
           <strong>
            Graafian follicle.
           </strong>
<br/>
           (xiii)The secondary oocyte forms a new membrane called
           <strong>
            zona pellucida
           </strong>
           surrounding it.
           <br/>
           (xiv)The Graafian follicle ruptures to release the secondary oocyte (ovum) from the ovary by the process called
           <strong>
            ovulation.
           </strong>

           .
           <strong>
            Menstrual cycle
           </strong>
           is a rhythmic change in the reproductive organs of the female
           <br/>
           primates (monkey, apes and humans).
           <br/>
           (i) The first menstruation begins at puberty and is called
           <strong>
            menarche.
           </strong>
<br/>
           (ii)Average interval of menstruation in human female is about 28-29 days.
           <br/>
           (iii)The cyclic events starting from one menstruation till the next one constitute
           <strong>
            menstrual cycle.
           </strong>
<br/>
           (iv)The four phases of menstrual cycle are:
           <br/>
<strong>
            Menstrual Phase
           </strong>
<br/>
           (a)Cycle starts with this phase and the menstrual flow occurs for 3-5 days.
           <br/>
           (b)It occurs due to breakdown of endometrial lining of the uterus. The blood vessels form liquid which along with unfertilised ovum comes out through the vagina.
           <br/>
           (c)Menstruation occurs only if fertilisation does not takes place.
           <br/>
           (d)Lack of menstruation generally indicates pregnancy but may also be due to stress, poor health, diseases, etc.
           <br/>
<strong>
            Follicular or Proliferative Phase
           </strong>
<br/>

            Luteal Phase/Secretory Phase
           </strong>
<br/>
           (a)Ovulatory phase is followed by the luteal phase.
           <br/>
           (b)The remaining parts of the ruptured Graafian follicle changes into corpus luteum.
           <br/>
           (c)Corpus luteum secretes large amounts of progesterone, which is required for the maintenance of endometrium.
           <br/>
           (d)The thickened endometrium is necessary for the implantation of fertilised ovum and maintenance of pregnancy.
           <br/>
           (e)During pregnancy, all the events of menstrual cycle stop and menstruation does not occur.
           <br/>
           (f)In case of no fertilisation, the corpus luteum degenerates. This causes rupture of endometrium leading to menstruation â initiation of a new cycle.
           <br/>
           (g)In human females, menstrual cycle stops around the age of 50 years called as
           <strong>

<br/>
<strong>
             Ans.
            </strong>
            GnRH or gonadotropin releasing hormone is a hypothalamic hormone. Spermatogenesis starts at puberty due to its significant increase.Its increased levels acts on anterior pituitary gland and stimulates the secretion of LH and FSH. LH acts on the Leydig cells and stimulates synthesis and secretion of androgens. FSH acts on Sertoli cells, which stimulates the secretion of some factors that help in spermiogenesis.

            (ii)The follicular cells of mature follicle secrete oestrogens, which control the growth and maintenance of the secondary sex organs like uterus, Fallopian tube, etc.
            <br/>
            (iii) FSH and LH reach their peak level around the mid-cycle (14th day). The peak level of LH surge causes the rupture of Graafian follicle and release of ovum (ovulation).
            <br/>
            (iv) LH influences the remaining parts of Graafian follicle to transform into corpus luteum.
            <br/>
            (v)Corpus luteum secretes large quantity ofÂ progesterone in the luteal phase. Progesterone is required for the growth and maintenance of endometrium of uterus for implantation.
            <br/>
            (vi)In the absence of fertilisation, the high levels of progesterone exert negative feed back on the pituitary. This stops the secretion of LH and corpus luteum degenerates leading to menstruation

            Hormonal control of spermatogenesis in human males:
            <br/>
            (i) Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) is released significantly from the hypothalamus during puberty.
            <br/>
            (ii) GnRH stimulate anterior pituitary to secrete gonadotropins, i.e. LH and FSH or Interstitial Cell Stimulating Hormone (ICSH).
            <br/>
            (iii)Leuteinising Hormone (LH) acts on LeydigÂ cells to stimulate synthesis and secretion of androgens. Androgens stimulates the process of spermatogenesis.
            <br/>
            (iv) Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) acts on Sertoli cells and stimulates them to secrete certain factors which are necessary for the process of spermiogenesis.

<strong>
             Menstrual cycle
            </strong>
            is a rhythmic change in the reproductive organs of the female
            <br/>
            primates (monkey, apes and humans).
            <br/>
            (i) The first menstruation begins at puberty and is called
            <strong>
             menarche.
            </strong>
<br/>
            (ii)Average interval of menstruation in human female is about 28-29 days.
            <br/>
            (iii)The cyclic events starting from one menstruation till the next one constitute
            <strong>
             menstrual cycle.
            </strong>
<br/>
            (iv)The four phases of menstrual cycle are:
            <br/>
<strong>
             Menstrual Phase
            </strong>
<br/>
            (a)Cycle starts with this phase and the menstrual flow occurs for 3-5 days.
            <br/>
            (b)It occurs due to breakdown of endometrial lining of the uterus. The blood vessels form liquid which along with unfertilised ovum comes out through the vagina.
            <br/>
            (c)Menstruation occurs only if fertilisation does not takes place.
            <br/>
            (d)Lack of menstruation generally indicates pregnancy but may also be due to stress, poor health, diseases, etc.
            <br/>
<strong>
             Follicular or Proliferative Phase
            </strong>
<br/>
            (a)Menstrual phase is followed by the follicular phase.
            <br/>
            (b)The primary follicle in the ovary grow to become a fully mature Graafian follicle and simultaneously the endometrium of uterus regenerates through proliferation.
            <br/>
            (c)Pituitary and ovarian hormones induce the changes in ovary and uterus.
            <br/>
            (d)LH and FSH levels increase gradually during this phase and stimulates follicular development.
            <br/>
            (e)The growing follicles secrete oestrogens.
            <br/>
            (f)Both LH and FSH attain highest level during mid-cycle (about 14

            (b)The remaining parts of the ruptured Graafian follicle changes into corpus luteum.
            <br/>
            (c)Corpus luteum secretes large amounts of progesterone, which is required for the maintenance of endometrium.
            <br/>
            (d)The thickened endometrium is necessary for the implantation of fertilised ovum and maintenance of pregnancy.
            <br/>
            (e)During pregnancy, all the events of menstrual cycle stop and menstruation does not occur.
            <br/>
            (f)In case of no fertilisation, the corpus luteum degenerates. This causes rupture of endometrium leading to menstruation â initiation of a new cycle.

<strong>
             Spermatogenesis
            </strong>
            is production of sperms in males.
            <br/>
            (i) In testis, the immature male germ cells (spermatogonia) produce sperms by
            <strong>
             spermatogenesis
            </strong>
            that begins at puberty.

            <br/>
            (iii) Each spermatogonium is diploid and contains 46 chromosomes. Some of the spermatogonia called
            <strong>
             primary spermatocytes

<br/>
<strong>
             Ans.(a)Oogenesis
            </strong>
            is the process of formation of a female gamete or ova in the ovary.
            <br/>
            (i)It starts during embryonic stage in a female.
            <br/>
            (ii)About a million oogonia are formed in the ovary of the female foetus (of 25 weeks). No new oogonia are formed after birth.
            <br/>
            (iii)The oogonial cells start meiotic division, enter into prophase-I, get temporarily arrested at that stage and are called as primary oocytes.
            <br/>
            (iv)Each primary oocyte then gets surrounded by a layer of granulosa cells calledÂ primary follicle.
            <br/>
            (v)A large number of primary follicles degenerate during the phase from birth to puberty. As a result, about 60,000-80,000 primary follicles are left in each ovary at puberty.

</strong>
            (vi)The primary follicles get surrounded by more layers of granulosa cells and a new theca and are called secondary follicles.
            <br/>
            (vii)The thecal layer in secondary follicles become organised into an outer theca externa and an inner theca interna. This stage is called tertiary follicle.
            <br/>
            (viii)Tertiary follicle is characterised by a fluid-filled cavity called antrum.
            <br/>
            (ix)At this stage, the primary oocyte within the tertiary follicle grows in size and completes its first meiotic division.
            <br/>
            (x)The first meiotic division which is unequal results in the formation of haploid secondary oocyte and tiny first polar body.
            <br/>

<strong>
             The pituitary hormones
            </strong>
            FSH and LH gradually increases during development of follicle (follicular phase) and reaches its peak level which induces ovulation.
            <strong>
             The ovarian hormones
            </strong>
            Oestrogen increases gradually till ovulation but decreases with increase in progesterone secretions by corpus luteum (after ovulation). These hormone secretions are reduced if ovum is not fertilised and corpus luteum degenerates, leading to menstrual flow.

            Hormonal control of spermatogenesis in human males:
            <br/>
            (a) Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) is released significantly from the hypothalamus during puberty.
            <br/>
            (b) GnRH stimulate anterior pituitary to secrete gonadotropins, i.e. LH and FSH or Interstitial Cell Stimulating Hormone (ICSH).
            <br/>
            (c)Leuteinising Hormone (LH) acts on LeydigÂ cells to stimulate synthesis and secretion of androgens. Androgens stimulates the process of spermatogenesis.
            <br/>
            (d) Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) acts on Sertoli cells and stimulates them to secrete certain factors which are necessary for the process of spermiogenesis.

             Explain the different stages of oogenesis in humans starting from foetal life till its completion. When and where in the body is oogenesis completed? Â  [Delhi 2009]
            </strong>
<br/>
            Ans.(i)In human females, primary oocytes areÂ formed during the embryonic developmental stages in the foetal ovaries.
            <br/>
            (ii) (a) Primary oocytes start dividing and Â enter prophase-l of meiosis to remainÂ suspended at this stage.
            <br/>
            (b) Each primary oocyte is surrounded byÂ a layer of granulosa cells and becomeÂ the primary follicle.
            <br/>
            (c) The primary follicle whenÂ surrounded by more layers ofÂ  granulosa cells, is called a secondaryÂ follicle.
            <br/>
            (d)Secondary follicle transforms into aÂ tertiary follicle, with theÂ Â  developmentof a fluid-filled Â  cavity (antrum)Â around the primary oocyte.
            <br/>
            (e)Granulosa cells become organisedÂ into an outer theca externa and anÂ inner theca interna.
            <br/>
            (f) Now, primary oocyte completesÂ meiosis-l and forms a larger haploidÂ secondary oocyte Â and a tiny firstÂ polar body.
            <br/>
            (g)Tertiary follicle grows and becomes a mature follicle called Graafian follicle.
            <br/>
            (h)Secondary oocyte secretes a new membrane called zona pellucidaÂ around it.
            <br/>
            (i)At this stage, follicle ruptures to release the secondary oocyte, whichÂ moves into the cytoplasm
            <br/>
            (j)Secondary oocyte completes meiosis-I I only when a sperm enters its cytoplasm. It forms a larger cell, the ootid and a small cell, the second polar body.
            <br/>
            (iii)
            <strong>
             Influence of Gonadotropins on oogenesis
            </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
             Gonadotropins, i.e. LH and FSH stimulate follicular development and secretion of oestrogens by the growing follicles.
            </li>
<li>
             Both LH and FSH attain a peak level in the middle of the cycle (14th day).
            </li>
<li>
             Rapid release of LH during mid-cycle causes ovulation.
            </li>
<li>
             LH also stimulates the formation ofÂ corpus luteum from the ruptured follicle and secretion of progesterone from corpus luteum.
            </li>

            is production of sperms in males.
            <br/>
            (a) In testis, the immature male germ cells (spermatogonia) produce sperms by
            <strong>
             spermatogenesis
            </strong>
            that begins at puberty.

            (sing, spermatogonium) present on the inside wall of seminiferous tubules multiply by mitotic division and increase in numbers.
            <br/>
            (c) Each spermatogonium is diploid and contains 46 chromosomes. Some of the spermatogonia called
            <strong>
             primary spermatocytes
            </strong>
            periodically undergo meiosis.

             47.Draw a labelled sectional view of a human ovary.Â Explain the events of oogenesis.Â  [Delhi 2008C]
            </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
             Ans.Oogenesis
            </strong>
            is the process of formation of a female gamete or ova in the ovary.
            <br/>
            (i)It starts during embryonic stage in a female.
            <br/>
            (ii)About a million oogonia are formed in the ovary of the female foetus (of 25 weeks). No new oogonia are formed after birth.
            <br/>
            (iii)The oogonial cells start meiotic division, enter into prophase-I, get temporarily arrested at that stage and are called as primary oocytes.
            <br/>
            (iv)Each primary oocyte then gets surrounded by a layer of granulosa cells calledÂ primary follicle.
            <br/>
            (v)A large number of primary follicles degenerate during the phase from birth to puberty. As a result, about 60,000-80,000 primary follicles are left in each ovary at puberty.
            <br/>
<img alt="important-questions-for-class-12-biology-cbse-gametogenesis-t-32-4" height="275" loading="lazy" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5674/23316066085_416a66b33d_o.png" width="423"/>
<br/>
            Development of ovum from an oogonium in a human female.
            <br/>
            (i) Oogonium which enters meiosis-l is the primary oocyte. Division remains suspended in prophase-l.
            <br/>
            (ii)Primary oocyte becomes surrounded by a layer of granulosa cells and is called the primary follicle.
            <br/>
            (iii) Primary follicle gets surrounded by more granulosa cells and a thecal layer. This stage is called secondary follicle.
            <br/>
            (iv) A cavity develops in the secondary follicle around the primary oocyte called antrum.
            <br/>
            (v)Thecal layer becomes organised into an outer theca externa and an inner theca interna. This stage is called tertiary follicle.
            <br/>
            (vi)Primary oocyte completes its meiosis-l and forms a large cell-the secondary oocyte and a tiny cell-the first polar body.
            <br/>
            (vii)Tertiary follicle transforms into a matureÂ follicle called Graafian follicle (mature ovum).

<br/>
<strong>
             Ans.
            </strong>
            (i)X-Leuteinising Hormone (LH)â
            <br/>
            YâFollicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)
            <br/>
            (ii) (a) 5th to 12th day of the menstrual cycle is called follicular phase. The primary follicles grow and become fully mature Graafian follicle.
            <br/>
            (b) 14th day of the cycle is called ovulatory phase and marks ovulation.
            <br/>
            (c)16th to 25th day is luteal phase. The corpus luteum secretes large amount of progesterone which is essential for the maintenance of the endometrium.
            <br/>
            (ii)Secretion of gonadotropins increases gradually during the follicular phase and stimulates follicular development as well as secretion of oestrogens by the growing follicles.Both LH and FSH attain a peak level in the middle of cycle. Rapid secretion of LH leads to LH surge, which induces rupture of follicle and release of ovum,i.e.ovulation.In the secretory phase LH stimulates the remains of Graafian on follicle to develop corpus luteum which secretes large amount of progesterone essential for maintenance of endometrium
