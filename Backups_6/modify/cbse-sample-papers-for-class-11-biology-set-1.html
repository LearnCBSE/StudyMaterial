           Question 30.
           <br/>
           Mitosis takes place both in somatic and reproductive cells of plants and animals. In multicellular organisms, mitosis produces more cells for growth and repair. Mitosis division is responsible for the growth and development of a single-celled zygote into a multicellular organism. Mitosis division helps in maintaining the proper size. Mitosis also helps in restoring wear and tear in body tissues, replacing damaged or lost part, healing wounds and regeneration of detached parts. Mitosis is a method of multiplication of unicellular organisms. It produces diploid daughter cells with identical genetic complements (both quantitatively and qualitatively) as in the parent cell. Mitosis is a continuous process and it is divided into four phases viz: prophase metaphase, anaphase and telophase. (4)
           <br/>
           (a) What is the significance of mitosis?

           Proteins are polypeptide chains made up of amino acids. There are 22 types of amino acids joined together by peptide bonds when carboxylic groups two amino acids: Essential and non-essential amino adds. The Primary structure of a protein is the linear sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain. The first amino acid of the enzyme is called a terminal acids and the last amino acid of the peptide is called C-terminal amino acid. The secondary structure proteins forms a helix. There are three types of secondary structure: a helix, p pleated and collagen helix. In tertiary structure long protein chain is folded upon itself like a hollow woollen ball to give three dimensional view of the protein. In quaternary structure, each polypeptide develops its own tertiary structure and function as a subunit of protein.
          </p>
<p>
           (a) Amino acids, as the name suggests, have both an amino group and a carboxyl group in their structure. In addition, all naturally occurring amino acids (those which are found in proteins) are called L-amino acids. From this, can you guess from which compound the simplest amino acid can be made?
           <br/>
           (b) Many organic substances are negatively charged e.g., acetic acid, while others are positively charged e.g., ammonium ion. An amino acid under certain conditions would have both positive and negative charges
           <br/>
           simultaneously in the same molecule. Name such form of amino acid.

           (d) Name the bond present in the tertiary structure of a protein contain.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Mitosis is an equational division and is a means of multiplication in unicellular organisms.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) Daughter cells formed have the same genetic constitution as the qualitatively and quantitatively and as the parent cell.
          </p>
<p>
           (c) Mitosis is an equational division. Daughter cells formed are genetically identical and similar to the mother cell. Number of chromosomes remain the same in parental and progeny cell.

           OR
           <br/>
           (a) Glycine is the simplest amino acid which has both an amino group of a carboxyl group in its structure and a single hydrogen atom as its side chain.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) Explanation: Under certain conditions, an amino acid may have both positive and negative charges simultaneously in the same molecule. Such a form of amino acid is known as zwitter ionic form.
          </p>
<p>
           (c) Primary protein is simply an amino acid sequence that has two ends, the carboxyl amino terminals.
          </p>
<p>
           (d) Tertiary structure of protein is maintained by several types of bonds such as hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, sulphide bonds, and hydrophilic and hydrophobic bonds formed between the part of a polypeptide and another.

           Flowers are determinate structures with a typically defined number of organs bearing pistillate and staminate parts. Floral formula helps to remember the characteristics of different families.
           <br/>
           (a) What is a floral diagram ?
           <br/>
           (b) What special features does a floral diagram inform?
           <br/>
           (c) Write down the floral formula for the family “Solanaceae”.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Plasmodesmata: These are cytoplasmic bridges between the two cells through the cell wall. They form a protoplasmic continuum called symplast. It allows communication and transport between two neighboring cells.
           <br/>

           Question 33.
           <br/>
           (a) (i) What is root? (5)
           <br/>
           (ii) Briefly explain the regions or parts present in a typical root.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           (b) (i) What is venation
           <br/>
           (ii) Explain its types.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) (i) Root:
           <br/>
           The root is a non-green, cylindrical descending part of the plant that normally grows downwards into the soil.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) A typical root possesses five parts or regions:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Root Cap: It is a thimble-shaped or cap-like, structure present at the tip of the root. It protects the tender apex of the root as it makes its way through the soil.
           </li>
<li>
            Growing or meristematic zone: It lies above the root cap. The cells of this zone divide actively and add new cells to the root and root cap.
           </li>
<li>
            Zone of elongation: It lies behind the meristematic zone. The cells of this region are newly formed cells, which lose the power of division. These also possess the power of absorption of water from the soil.
           </li>
<li>
            Zone of root hair: It lies above the region of elongation and bears clusters of very fine tubular outgrowths called root hairs. This zone is also called the zone of differentiation because different types of primary tissues mature in this region.
           </li>
<li>
            Zone of maturation: This region forms the major part of the root and no change occurs in this region. It forms the permanent zone of the root and also gives out lateral roots.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           OR
           <br/>
           (b) (i) Venation: The arrangement of veins and veinlets in the lamina of a leaf is called venation. The veins are not only the conducting channels for water, minerals, and organic food, but they also provide firmness to the lamina and keep it expanded. They give rise to lateral veins, which traverse the entire lamina.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Venation is of two types: Reticulate and parallel.
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Reticulate venation: When the veinlets form a network, the venation is termed reticulate venation, e.g., leaves of dicot plants.
           </li>
<li>
            Parallel venation: When the veins arising from midrib or main veins, run parallel to each other towards the margin or the apex of the lamina, venation is termed as parallel venation. Present in the leaves of monocot plants. Parallel venation is of two sub-types:
           </li>
<li>
            Pinnate or unicostate parallel venation:
            <br/>
            The lamina has a single prominent vein or midrib running from the base to the apex of the lamina, e.g., Banana, Canna, etc.
           </li>
<li>
            Palmate or multicostate parallel venation: The lamina has several principal veins arising from the base and running towards the apex or margin of the lamina.
           </li>
</ul>
