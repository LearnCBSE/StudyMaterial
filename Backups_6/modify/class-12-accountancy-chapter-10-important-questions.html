           Accounting Ratios Important Questions Class 12 Accountancy Chapter 10
          </h2>
<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           State how personal bias can get reflected in ratio analysis. (All India (C) 2011)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In many situations, the accountant has to make the choice out of various alternatives available, e.g. choice in the method of depreciation (straight line or written down), choice in the method of inventory valuation (LIFO, FIFO or HIFO). Since the subjectivity is inherent in personal judgement, the financial statements are therefore not free from personal bias. As a result, ratio analysis cannot be said to be free from bias.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The two limitations of ratio analysis are
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Accounting ratios ignore qualitative factors.
           </li>

           Question 3.
           <br/>
           What is meant by accounting ratios? (Delhi (C) 2010)
           <br/>
           Answer:

<p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           State with reason whether repayment of long-term loan will result in increase, decrease or no change of debt equity ratio. (All India 2012)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Debt-equity ratio will decrease as repayment of long-term loan will reduce the long- term debt but the shareholders’ funds will remain same.
          </p>

<p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           A company had current assets ₹ 3,00,000 and current liabilities ₹ 1,40,000. Afterwards, it purchased goods worth ₹ 20,000 on credit. Calculate the current ratio after the purchase of goods. (All India 2019)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           New current assets = 3,00,000 + 20,000
           <br/>
           New current liabilities = 1,40,000 + 20,000 = ₹ 1,60,000
           <br/>
           Current Ratio = \(\frac { current assets }{ current liabilities }\)
           <br/>
           = \(\frac { 320000 }{ 160000 }\) = 2 : 1
          </p>
<p>
           Question 6.
           <br/>
           From the following information calculate interest coverage ratio. Net profit after interest and tax ₹ 1,20,000; Rate of income tax 40% ; 15% debentures ₹ 1,00,000; 12% mortgage loan ₹ 10,000. (All India2019)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Rate of tax 40%
           <br/>
           Profit after tax = 100 – 40 = 60% and according to question profit after tax is ₹ 1,20,000.
           <br/>
           So, profit before tax = \(\frac { 120000 }{ 60% }\) = 2,00,000 60%
           <br/>

<p>
           Question 8.
           <br/>
           The current ratio of Y Ltd is 2 : 1. State with reason, which of the following transactions would (a) increase, (b) decrease or (c) not change the ratio
           <br/>
           (i) Trade receivables included debtors of ₹ 40,000 which were received Company purchased furniture of ₹ 45,000. The vendor was paid by issue of equity shares of ₹ 10 each at par (Delhi 2014)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Not change the ratio Simultaneous increase and decrease by same amount in current assets will not effect the value of current assets or current liabilities, therefore, there is no effect on the current ratio.
           <br/>
           (ii) Not Change the ratio Issue of shares for furniture purchased do not effect either current assets or current liabilities. Therefore, current ratio will not be effected.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 9.
           <br/>
           The quick ratio of Z Ltd is 1 : 1 State with reason which of the following transactions would (a) increase, (b) decrease or (c) not change the ratio
           <br/>
           (i) Included in the trade payables was a bills payable of ₹ 3,000 which was met on maturity.
           <br/>
           (ii) Debentures of ₹ 50,000 were converted into equity shares. (Delhi 2014)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Not change the ratio Simultaneous decrease in both current assets and current liabilities will not effect the quick ratio.
           <br/>
           (ii) Not change the ratio Debentures converted into shares do not effect either quick assets or current liabilities. Therefore, quick ratio will not be effected.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 10.
           <br/>
           X Ltd has a current ratio of 3 : 1 and quick ratio of 2 : 1. If the excess of current assets over quick assets as represented by inventory is ₹ 40,000, calculate current assets and current liabilities. (All India 2012)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Let the current liabilities = x
           <br/>
<img alt="Accounting Ratios Class 12 Important Questions and Answers Accountancy Chapter 10 Img 2" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-147746" height="96" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Accounting-Ratios-Class-12-Important-Questions-and-Answers-Accountancy-Chapter-10-Img-2.png" width="293"/>
<br/>
           Therefore, quick or liquid assets = 2x
           <br/>
           Liquid Assets = Current Assets – Inventory
           <br/>
           2x = 3x – 40,000
           <br/>
           2x – 3x = -40,000
           <br/>
           -x = -40,000
           <br/>
           x = 40,000
           <br/>
           Current Liabilities = ₹ 40,000
           <br/>
           Current Assets = 3 × ₹ 40,000 = ₹ 1,20,000
          </p>
<p>
           Question 11.
           <br/>
           OM Ltd has a current ratio of 3.5 : 1 and quick ratio of 2 : 1. If the excess of current assets over quick assets as represented by inventory is ₹ 1,50,000, calculate current assets and current liabilities. Delhi 2012
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Solve as Q no. 7 on page 433.
           <br/>
           Current Liabilities = ₹ 1,00,000
           <br/>
           Current Assets = ₹ 3,50,000
          </p>
<p>
           Question 12.
           <br/>
           On basis of the following information, calculate
           <br/>

<br/>
           Long-term Debts = 6% Debentures + 9% Loan
           <br/>
           = 300000 +100000 = ₹ 400000
           <br/>
           Shareholders Funds = Paid-up Share Capital + Debenture Redemption Reserve
           <br/>
           = 600000 + 200000 = ₹ 800000

           <br/>
           **Current Assets = Other Current Assets + Closing Inventory
           <br/>
           = 1100000 + 1,00,000

           Am. (i) Decrease
           <br/>
           As payment of insurance premium will decrease the quick assets.
           <br/>
           (ii) Decrease
           <br/>
           As purchase of goods on credit will increase the current liabilities.
           <br/>
           (iii) Increase
           <br/>
           As issue of equity shares will increase quick assets.
           <br/>

           Answer:
           <br/>
           Total Assets = Fixed Assets + Non-current Investments + Current Assets = 12,00,000 + 1,50,000 + 1,90,000 = ₹ 15,40,000
           <br/>
           Now, Total Liabilities = Total Assets
           <br/>
           “Equity Share Capital + 9% Preference Share Capital + Reserve and Surplus + Non-current Liabilities (Debt) + Current Liabilities = ₹ 15,40,000
           <br/>
           5,00,000 + 4,00,000 + 2,40,000 + 1,00,000 + Non-current Liabilitiess = ₹ 15,40,000
           <br/>
           Non-current Liabilities (Debt) = 15,40,000 -12,40,000 = ₹ 3,00,000
           <br/>
           Now, Total Assets to Debt Ratio = \(\frac { Total Assets }{ Debt }\) = \(\frac { 1540000 }{ 300000 }\) = 5.133 : 1

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Total Liabilities = Equity Share Capital + Long-term Borrowings + Surplus + General Reserve + Current Liabilities + Long-term Provisions
           <br/>
           = 4,00,000 + 1,80,000 + 100000 + 70,000 + 30,000 + 1,20,000 = ₹ 900,000

           (iv) Sold goods ₹ 50,000 for cash. (All Indio 2019)
           <br/>
           Answer:

           (i) Purchased goods on credit ₹ 20,000
           <br/>
           ⇒ No change
           <br/>
           As both purchase and closing stock will increase, so there will be no effect on cost of goods sold.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Paid wages ₹ 5,000
           <br/>
           ⇒ Increase

<p>
           (iv) Sold goods ₹ 50,000 for cash
           <br/>
           ⇒ Decrease

           <br/>
           Compute the ‘working capital turnover ratio of the company. (Comportment 2018)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Gross Profit = 25% on cost
           <br/>
           Gross profit ₹ 500000
           <br/>
           ∴ Revenue from Operation = \(\frac { 125 }{ 25 }\) × 500000

<br/>
           ⇒ Gross Loss = 5% of 16,00,000 = ₹ 80,000
           <br/>
           Cost of Revenue from Operations = Revenue from Operations + Gross Loss
           <br/>
           = 16,00,000 + 80,000 = ₹ 16,80,000

          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Interest Coverage Ratio
           <br/>
<img alt="Accounting Ratios Class 12 Important Questions and Answers Accountancy Chapter 10 Img 18" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-147762" height="83" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Accounting-Ratios-Class-12-Important-Questions-and-Answers-Accountancy-Chapter-10-Img-18.png" width="250"/>
<br/>
           Calculation of net profit before interest and tax Net profit after tax = 1,20,000; Tax = 40%
           <br/>
           If profit after tax is 60, profit before tax is 100 and if profit after tax is ₹ 1,20300
           <br/>
           Profit before tax would be
           <br/>
           = \(\frac { 100 }{ 60 }\) × 1,20300 = ₹ 2,00,000
           <br/>
           Interest on long-term debt
           <br/>
           = 2,00,000 × 12% = ₹ 2,40,000
           <br/>
           Therefore, Profit before interest and tax = 2,00,000 + 2,40,000 = ₹ 4,40,000
          </p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
           ‘Operating Profit = Revenue from Operations** – Cost of Revenue from Operations (Opening stock + Purchases – Closing stock) – Selling Expenses – Administrative Expenses
           <br/>
           = 3,85,000 – [10800 +1,15,000 (1,20000 – 5000) – 60000] – 70,000 – 40000
           <br/>
           = 385000 – 65000 – 70000 – 40000 = ₹ 2,10,000
           <br/>
           “Revenue from Operations = Revenue from Operations – Returns from Revenue from Operations
           <br/>
           = 400000 -15000 = ₹ 385000
          </p>

<p>
           Operating Cost = Cost of Goods Sold + Operating Expenses
           <br/>
           = 5,44000 + 1,44000 + 73000 = ₹ 781000
           <br/>
           Gross profit = \(\frac { 1 }{ 4 }\) on cost Or \(\frac { 1 }{ 5 }\) on sales = \(\frac { 1 }{ 5 }\) × 680000 = ₹ 136000
           <br/>
           Let cost of goods sold be = x ⇒ 136000 = \(\frac { 1 }{ 4 }\) × x ⇒ x = ₹ 5,44,000

           Question 33.
           <br/>
           From the given information calculate the following
           <br/>
           (i) Cost of revenue from operations
           <br/>
           (ii) Opening and closing inventory
           <br/>
           (iii) Quick assets
           <br/>
           (iv) Current assets
           <br/>
           Information Inventory turnover ratio 6 times, inventory at the end is ₹ 6,000 more than the inventory in the beginning, revenue from operations (all credits) ₹ 2,40,000, Gross profit 25% on cost, current liabilities ₹ 80,000, quick ratio 080 : 1. (Delhi (C) 2016)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Let cost be 100
           <br/>
           Gross profit be = 25
           <br/>
           Revenue from operations = 100 + 25 = 125
           <br/>
           Revenue from operations (all credits) = 2,40,000
           <br/>
           ∴ Cost of revenue from operations
           <br/>
           = 2,40,000 × \(\frac { 100 }{ 125 }\)
           <br/>

           <br/>
           Average Inventory
           <br/>
           = \(\frac{x+x+6000}{2}=\frac{2 x+6,000}{2}\) = x + 3000

           6x = 1,92,000 – 18,000
           <br/>
           x = \(\frac { 174000 }{ 6 }\) = 29,000
           <br/>
           ‘Opening inventory ⇒ x ⇒ 29,000 = x + 6,000

           The current ratio of a company is 2.1 : 1.2. State with reasons which of the following transactions will increase, decrease or not change the ratio
           <br/>
           (i) Redeemed 9% debentures of ₹ 1,00,000 at a premium of 10%.
           <br/>

           (iv) Accepted bills of exchange drawn by the creditors ₹ 7,000. (All India 2015)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Decrease Current assets will decrease because of outflow of cash but current liabilities will remain unchanged therefore current ratio will decrease.
           <br/>
           (ii) Not change the ratio Simultaneous increase and decrease in the value of current assets i.e. cash and debtors by the same amount will not effect the ratio.
           <br/>
           (iii) Not change the ratio Issue of shares for purchase of machinery do not effect either current assets or current liabilities, therefore current ratio will not be effected.
           <br/>
           (iv) Not change the ratio In this case one current liability (i.e. creditors) is getting converted into another current liability (i.e. bills payable), therefore current ratio will not be effected.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           Total Assets to Debt Ratio = \(\frac{\text { Total Assets }}{\text { Debt }}=\frac{1485,000}{6,45,000}\) = 2.30 : 1
           <br/>
           Total Assets = Investments + Land + Trade Receivables + Cash and Cash Equivalent
           <br/>
           = 2,10000 + 8,50,000 + 2,75,000 + 1,50,000 = ₹ 14,85,000
           <br/>
           Debt = Capital Employed – (Equity share capital + Reserves + Surplus)
           <br/>
           = 25,00,000 – 18,55,000 (1430,000 + 2,75000 + 130000)

<br/>
           Operating Profit = Gross Profit – Other Operating Expenses + Other Operating Incomes
           <br/>
           = 75,000 – 41,000 + 2,000
           <br/>
           = ₹ 36,000
           <br/>
           Other Operating Expenses = Office Expenses + Selling Expenses
           <br/>
           = 15,000 +26,000
           <br/>
           = ₹ 41,000
           <br/>
           Other Operating Incomes = Commission
           <br/>
           Received

           Let Credit revenue from operations be y
           <br/>
           Cash revenue from operations = 60% of credit revenue from operations Revenue from Operations = Cash Revenue from Operations + Credit Revenue from Operations
           <br/>
           5,20,000 = 60% of y + y
