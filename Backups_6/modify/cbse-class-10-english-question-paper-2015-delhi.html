           Read the passage given below carefully:
           <br/>
           1. I rested for a moment at the door of Anand Bhawan, on Market Road, where coffee- drinkers and tiffin-eaters sat still at their tables, uttering low moans on seeing me. I wanted to assure them, “Don’t mind me, you hugging the cash box – you are a coward, afraid even to breathe. Go on, count the cash, if that is your pleasure. I just want to watch, that’s all. If my tail trails down to the street, if I am blocking your threshold, it is because, I’m told, I’m eleven feet tip to tail. I can’t help it. I’m not out to kill – I’m too full. I found a green pasture full of food on my way. I won’t attack until I feel hungry again. Tigers attack only when they feel hungry, unlike human beings who slaughter one another without purpose or hunger.”
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           2. To the great delight of children, schools were being hurriedly closed. Children of all ages and sizes were running helter-skelter, screaming joyously, “No school, no school. Tiger, tiger !” They seemed to welcome me. I felt like joining them. So I bounded away from the restaurant door. I walked along with them, at which they cried, ‘The tiger is coming to eat us; let us get back to school!”
          </p>
<p>
           3. I followed them through their school gate while they ran up and shut themselves in the school hall securely. I climbed up the steps of the school, saw- an open door at the far end of a veranda, and walked in. It happened to be the headmaster’s room. I noticed a very dignified man jumping on the table and heaving himself up into an attic. I walked in and flung myself on the cool floor, having a special liking for cool stone floors.
          </p>
<p>
           4. As I drowsed, I was aware of cautious steps and hushed voices all around. I was in no mood to bother about anything. All I wanted was a little moment of sleep; the daylight was very bright.

<p>
           1.1 On the basis of the reading of the passage, answer the following questions briefly: 2 × 4 = 8
           <br/>
           (a) How did the diners at Anand Bhawan react on seeing the tiger?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The diners at Anand Bhawan, the coffee-drinkers and tiffin-eaters sat still at their tables and uttered low moans on seeing the tiger.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) When do tigers attack? In this context, how are human beings different from tigers?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The tigers attack when they are hungry. Human beings on the other hand slaughter one another without purpose or hunger.
          </p>
<p>
           (c) Why were children happy and even enjoying being scared?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The children were happy as the schools were being hurriedly closed. They were screaming joyously, ‘No school’. They seemed to welcome the tiger in their joy and were shouting and laughing.
          </p>
<p>
           (d) What was the tiger’s opinion about the man at the cash counter? What did the tiger assure him?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The tiger thought the man to be a coward, afraid even to breathe and assured him to continue counting the cash as he just wanted to watch.

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below:
          </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
           Hunger pangs in India may have just gotten worse
          </p>
<p>
           1. Dire straits. Despite improvements in sanitation and access to water, which could be the reasons for nutritional deficiency, child malnutrition levels have in fact increased in several states over the past 5 years. Thus, economic reasons may be at the root of the decline.
           <br/>

<br/>
           2. What do the NFHS findings indicate? In a number of large states, the proportion of children under 5 who are underweight has risen, compared to the previous National Family Health Survey (NFHS) round in 2015 – 16. Even relatively advanced states like Gujarat and Maharashtra have recorded a slide in the nutritional well-being of their children since 2015. This is contradictory to what should ideally happen in a growing economy, since rising prosperity should improve access to food. The ground situation in 22 states and union territories was captured in phase-I of the survey – which was interrupted by the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown.
          </p>
<p>
           3. Could this be a fallout of the pandemic? The NFHS surveyors had started fanning out to households across the country since mid-2019. The exercise of reaching out to over 6,00,000 households was likely to last a year, but those plans were disrupted in March. Thus, the phase-I results have nothing to do with covid-19 and are an indication of India’s nutritional state before March. If anything, the prevalence of hunger is only expected to have shot up in subsequent months. The first official glimpse of covid’s economic impact may thus get captured in phase-II, which will cover key states like Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. The results will be out by May 2021.- By Ajai Sreevatsan

           <br/>
           Through the medium of your esteemed newspaper I wish to express my concern over the recent death of a young student resulting from a racial comment against people from the Northeast.
          </p>
<p>
           India is a land of diverse cultures, customs and traditions. This diversity strengthens our nation and teaches us to be tolerant and respect each other. But the recent increase in crimes against the Northeast community is a major cause of worry. The fear of violence and racial discrimination has made them feel alienated from the mainstream in life especially in the cities. The concerned authorities, especially the government should enforce laws to prohibit racial discrimination. The Northeast region, its culture, diversity, language should be brought to the mainstream by including it in the text of school curriculum. Government should take steps to popularize the rich handicraft of Northeast which is also eco-friendly.
          </p>
<p>
           I hope you will publish my letter in your reputed newspaper so that the concerned authorities can take necessary steps to solve the problem.

          </p>
<p>
           Sir,
           <br/>
           Through the medium of the columns of your esteemed newpaper, I wish to draw the attention of the concerned authorities towards the pathetic condition of slums and would request for a proper solution to their problems.
          </p>
<p>
           As we are aware that slums are spreading more widely and faster than the planned townships. The life in these slums is miserable. Congested living, lack of drinking water, insanitary and unhygienic conditions, poor power supply etc. are causing a lot of sufferings to the people who dwell in the slums. The concerned authorities have turned a blind eye and a deaf ear to their woes and miseries.
          </p>
<p>
           It is my earnest appeal to the concerned authorities to take up measures to solve their numerous problems. These squatter settlements can be improved through urban planning. This would involve taking up the initiative to replace the slums with high-rise tower blocks of small affordable flats. Though the cost of this would be very high and considering the magnitude of the problems faced by the slum dwellers, it is imperative that the government takes up initiatives in their favour.
          </p>
<p>
           I hope you will publish my letter in your newspaper so that the attention of the concerned authorities is drawn towards this problem.
          </p>

           <br/>
           Advertisements have become a big business. They are promoted by celebrities and leave a great impact on all people. It is felt that the Celebs should be responsible for the products they endorse.
           <br/>
           Write a paragraph to analyse the given argument.
           <br/>
           You could think about what alternative explanations might weaken the given conclusion and include rational evidence that would strengthen/ counter the given argument. 8
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           [A] The bar graph shows death a result of violence has been on an incessant rise. This graph makes it evident that rising cases of deaths due to intolerance and violence have been on a steady rise in the last two decades. In the year 2000 deaths due to violence was 2.5 which rose up to 7.5 in the year 2020. This gives us a clear picture in this present day and age of the horrific actions and events that are not only prevalent but are on a rise in the society in which we live. In the past the number of deaths had risen from 4.5 to 6.5 between the year 2010 – 2015. This steep rise is very disturbing and alarming. Steps to rectify the frightening situation needs to be taken on an urgent basis.
           <br/>
           Or,
           <br/>
           [B] Advertisements are indeed a big business. Many celebrities promote various products wherein they make claims of the authenticity of the product confidently. There are people who actually buy products as they are being endorsed by their favorite celebrity. Since celebrities promote products in exchange for major monetary gains, they are morally liable if the product is not what it was made out to be. By endorsing products that are not up to the mark the Celebrities exploit their followers’ trust in them and misuse their popularity. Though it is the moral duty of the celebrities to behave responsibly but in case they choose to give priority to the monetary gains, there must be some regulations and monitoring process so that people are not misled by celebrities whom they idolise.

It was during the meal that, just as Lencho had predicted, big drops of rain began to fall. In the northeast huge mountains of clouds could be seen approaching. The air was fresh and sweet. The man went out for no other reason than to have the pleasure of feeling the rain on his body, and when he returned he exclaimed: “These aren’t raindrops falling from the sky, they are new coins. The big drops are ten-cent pieces and the little ones are fives”.

           (d) What was the cause of Matilda’s ruin?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Matilda would have saved herself and her husband a great deal of trouble and could have prevented her ruin if only she had the courage to confess to Mme Forestier, that she had lost the necklace. If Matilda had been truthful with Mme Forestier she could have known then that the diamonds were fake and would not have gone ahead and replaced them with real diamonds that cost Matilda her ruin. But Matilda chose to hide the truth from her friend and so she had to face a great deal of hardships and had to lead a horrible life for ten years all because of her own mistakes. Matilda suffered because she was a discontented woman who lacked the courage to speak the truth.

           (e) Justify, in brief, the title of the play “The Proposal”?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The title of the play “The Proposal” is justified because essentially the theme of the play is about Lomov’s marriage proposal to Chubukov’s daughter Natalya. He does end up in a silly argument with the father and daughter but the moment his intention about the proposal is revealed everything becomes normal.

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Answer the following question in about 100 – 150 words. 8
           <br/>
           “Never mind,” she said, “I can get on by myself,” You don’t have to help me,” said Valli to the conductor. She shows extraordinary courage in making the bus journey all alone. Taking inspiration from Valli’s character, write how ability and courage to take risk are essential to fulfill one’s dream.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           We are proud of India for its rich culture and diversity. Explain with reference to the descent, culture and traditions of the people of ‘Coorg’.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Valli’s earnest wish was to ride on the bus that travelled between her village and the nearest town. Her meticulous planning and strong will power made her plan and execute the journey successfully. She saved money, gathered the required information and waited patiently for the eighth time to go on her journey. Her courage, confidence and dignity on the journey made the conductor call her ‘Madam’. The journey taught her to be independent and to get to know about the outside world. It also taught her to interact with different kinds of people. She shows extraordinary courage in making the journey alone. Valli teaches us an important lesson in life, that is never to give up and make all efforts and take risks to chase our dreams.
           <br/>
           Or,
           <br/>
           Coorg, or Kodagu, lies midway between Mysore and the coastal town of Mangalore. Coorg is a land of rolling hills inhabited by a proud race of martial men, beautiful women and wild creatures. The fiercely independent people of Coorg are possibly of Greek or Arabic descent. As one story goes, a part of Alexander’s army moved south along the coast and settled here when return became impractical. These people married amongst the locals and their culture is apparent in the martial traditions, marriage and religious rites, which are distinct from the Hindu mainstream. The theory of the Kodavu people’s Arab origin draws support from the long black coat called ‘Kuppia’ with an embroidered waist belt that they wear. This resembles the ‘Kuffia’ worn by the Arabs.
          </p>
<p>
           The Coorg regiment is one of the most decorated in the Indian Army, and the first chief of the Indian army General Cariappa was a Coorgi. The Coorgi people’s tradition for valour and bravery has been recognized in modern India by honouring the Coorg regiment as the most decorated in the Indian Army. Also the first chief of the Indian Army, General Cariappa was a Coorgi and Kodavus are the only people in India permitted to carry fire arms without a licence. Coorg also houses the largest Tibetan settlement of Buddhist monks at the island of Nisargadhama. Many surprises wait to be discovered by visitors searching for the heart and soul of India, at Coorg.

           Question 11.
           <br/>
           Answer the following question in about 100 – 120 words. 8
           <br/>
           “Put the fear out of your heart and you will be able to speak like anyone else.” These words of encouragement from the teacher highlight that change of social attitude and encouragement can help a child like Bholi to become confident and face the world bravely. Taking help from the lesson, ‘Bholi’ write how the social attitude towards Bholi made her an introvert. What should be done to help such children to face the world bravely?
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           ‘Over-pampering is not only bad for humans but also for animals’. Prove this statement in the light of the lesson ‘A Triumph of Surgery’.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Bholi had remained a backward child and her entire body was disfigured due to an attack of small pox at the age of two. She stammered when she spoke. New clothes were never made for Bholi. No one even cared to mend or wash her clothes. Her parents attitude towards her was very hostile.
          </p>
<p>
           Love, care and sympathetic treatment to the mentally and physically challenged children can work wonders and if they are shown neglect and indifference they tend to become introverted and shy like Bholi.
          </p>
<p>
           Such children need social and parental attention and encouragement so that they come out of their complex. Bholi’s teacher helped in transforming Bholi into a bold and confident person ready to face the world bravely. Her teacher makes her confident enough to fight for her own right and not be taken for granted by a mean, greedy and contemptible man like Bishamber. Kind words, love and a sympathetic pat help such children to regain confidence, enable them to compete with others and ultimately help them become socially acceptable.
           <br/>
           Or,
           <br/>
           Tricki, a small dog, was pampered by his rich mistress. He was overfed by her to such an extent that he became hugely fat, like a bloated sausage. Since he was never refused food, he became greedy and could tackle a meal at any hour of the day and night. Inspite of repeated warnings of Dr. Herriot, Mrs. Pumphrey could not help pampering him. Finally, Tricki became very ill. He would eat nothing, even refused his favourite dishes and had bouts of vomiting. He spent all his time lying on a rug, panting. It was only after Dr. Herriot got him out of Mrs. Pumphrey’s house and kept him away from his overpampering mistress that the little dog recovered and was transformed into a lithe, hardmuscled animal.
