<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Why does a fast car slow down if its engine is switched off?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When the engine of a car is switched off, then there is no energy available for the engine to oppose the frictional forces. Thus, the engine slows down and eventually comes to rest.
          </p>

           Question 36.
           <br/>
           When we try to push a very heavy box kept on ground, it does not move at all. Which force is preventing this box to move forward? Where does this force act?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Whenever we push a very heavy box kept on the ground, it does not move at all because frictional force balances the force that we apply. So, there is no net movement of this box. It acts in a direction opposite to the force we apply.

           Question 38.
           <br/>
           Which will cause more friction: a rough surface or a smooth surface? Why?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A rough surface will cause more friction than a smooth surface. Because, rough offers more resistance to the other surface in contact as compared to the smooth surface.

<p>
           Question 39.
           <br/>
           Explain why sliding friction is less than static friction.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The sliding friction is less than static friction because, in sliding friction, the interlinking of the two surfaces is for very short time.
           <br/>
           Friction mainly arises due to the interlocking of irregularities between two surfaces, as shown below in the diagram:
           <br/>
<img alt="Lakhmir Singh Science Class 8 Solutions Chapter 12 Friction 3" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-121160" height="209" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 372px) 100vw, 372px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Lakhmir-Singh-Science-Class-8-Solutions-Chapter-12-Friction-3.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Lakhmir-Singh-Science-Class-8-Solutions-Chapter-12-Friction-3.png 372w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Lakhmir-Singh-Science-Class-8-Solutions-Chapter-12-Friction-3-300x169.png 300w" width="372"/>
<br/>
           In smooth surfaces, there are very fewer irregularities, thus friction is very very less. But, on rough surfaces, the irregularities are very large.
          </p>
<p>
           In sliding friction, the time of interlocking is very less, as one object slides over another object. Whereas, in static friction, one object is moved over another object thus the irregularities time is more. Thus, the two surfaces could not properly come in contact with each other in sliding due to which the magnitude of static friction is more than sliding friction.

           Question 40.
           <br/>
           What is meant by ‘rolling friction’?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Rolling friction is the friction or drag which opposes the motion when a body rolls.

           Question 41.
           <br/>
           Iqbal has to push a lighter box and Seema has to push a similar heavier box on the same floor. Who will have to apply a larger force and why?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Seema will have to apply larger force than Iqbal.
           <br/>
<img alt="Lakhmir Singh Science Class 8 Solutions Chapter 12 Friction 4" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-121161" height="209" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Lakhmir-Singh-Science-Class-8-Solutions-Chapter-12-Friction-4.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Lakhmir-Singh-Science-Class-8-Solutions-Chapter-12-Friction-4.png 329w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Lakhmir-Singh-Science-Class-8-Solutions-Chapter-12-Friction-4-300x191.png 300w" width="329"/>
<br/>
           Because Seema’s box is heavier and Seema will have to apply greater force to overcome the larger friction in case of the heavier box.

           Question 42.
           <br/>
           Why does a man slip when he steps on a banana peel thrown on the road?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           While walking on the road, a man slips if he steps on a banana peel because the banana peel acts a lubricant between the road and the man’s shoe which reduces the friction. Thus, man slips on it.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 43.
           <br/>
           Car wheels often spin on icy roads. Explain why.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A car spins on icy road because the treads of the car can no longer maintain the proper friction to keep it moving. Due to ice, the friction reduces and the car spins.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 44.
           <br/>
           Explain why:
           <br/>
           (a) A pencil will write on paper but not on glass.
           <br/>
           (b) climbing a greasy pole is very difficult.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) A pencil is made up of graphite. The paper surface offers more friction to the pencil when we write on the paper, in this way when the pencil is rubbed on the paper, some bits of graphite come on the paper and we are able to write. But glass offers no friction to the pencil, therefore we can’t write on a glass with pencil.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) Climbing a greasy pole is very difficult because the greasy pole offers very less friction to the feet of the person climbing on it. Du to which, the person slips down again and again.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 45.
           <br/>
           Why does a matchstick light when we strike it on a rough surface ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When a matchstick is rubbed on a rough surface, the surface produces friction. And we know friction produces heat, therefore the matchstick lightens up.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 46.
           <br/>
           Why is it difficult to light a matchstick by striking it on a smooth surface ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The smooth surface offers very less friction, due to which very less heat is produced by it and it is not sufficient to lighten up the matchstick.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 47.
           <br/>
           Which parts wear away first in shoes? Give a reason for your answer.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The heels of the shoes get wear and tear first than the rest of the shoe sole. This is because, the heel of the shoe is interacted with the ground more than the other part and due to friction, the treads of the shoe sole wear out.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 48.
           <br/>
           Why do brake pads of bicycles have to be replaced quite often?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The brake pads of bicycles have to be replaced quite often because they gather more dirt, dust and the filthy matter on itself. So to allow proper functioning, they have to be replaced.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 49.
           <br/>
           A pencil eraser loses tiny pieces of rubber each time you use it. Why does this happen ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           This is because the paper surface offers more friction to the pencil rubber when we rub on the paper, some bits of rubber come on the paper.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 50.
           <br/>
           What happens when you rub your hands vigorously for a few seconds ? Why does this happen ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           By rubbing our hands against each other we create friction between our hands and this friction produces heat. Therefore, out hands become warm.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 51.
           <br/>
           Explain how, friction enables us to walk without slipping.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When step forward and walk, we are applying force (denoted by “F”) on the ground. Now, in return ground also applies the reaction force to us. But we can fall if friction (denoted by “f”) is not present as the large ground can apply a large force . This is explained in the diagram:

           Question 52.
           <br/>
           Which is easier to hold in hand: a kulhar (earthen pot) or a glass tumbler? Why?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           It is easier to hold a kulhar (an earthen pot) because it more rough surface as it is made from mud. Mud offers more friction than glass and we are able to from a grip on the earthen plot.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 53.
           <br/>
           How does a bicycle stop when its brakes are applied ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When we apply brake sot the bicycle, a force of friction generates between the rim of the bicycle and the brakes. The friction is produced in opposite direction of motion. Thus, the bicycle is stopped.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 54.
           <br/>
           Explain why, the soles of our shoes wear out gradually.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The shoes rub on the ground while walking. The ground offers friction due to which the sole of shoes wear and tear out.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 55.
           <br/>
           Why do tyres of cars wear out gradually ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The tyres of the car wear out due to friction produced between he tyres and the car when a car is moving.
          </p>

           <br/>
           Explain why, sportsmen use shoes with spikes.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The sports people use shoes with spikes, spikes increase the friction with the ground and does not let the person slip or fall when running fast.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 58.
           <br/>
           How will you reduce friction between those machine parts which rub against each other? Give the simplest method.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           By applying any lubricant , say grease, one can reduce friction between those machine parts which rub against each other to avoid wear and tear.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 59.
           <br/>
           What is meant by lubrication ? Why is it important?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Lubrication means applying some additive to the parts of a machine to reduce the friction. Its important because it reduces the friction between the parts of the machine. But excess lubrication can generate more heat.
           <br/>

           Question 60.
           <br/>
           Explain why, wheels are so useful.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Wheels are important because they are used for transportation. Heavy machines can be moved from one place to another with the help of wheels because wheels can be rolled and the amount of force is also comparatively less.

           Question 61.
           <br/>
           Why are lubricants (oil or grease) applied to rubbing surfaces of machines?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Lubricants (oil or grease) are applied to rubbing surfaces of machines because when the parts rub against each other, heat is produced. To avoid the wearing and tearing of the machine parts, lubrication is done. Because it reduces the friction and thus less heat is produced.

           Question 62.
           <br/>
           Explain with the help of diagrams, how the use of oil reduces friction between two surfaces in contact with each other.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           If we oil between the two surfaces, say part1 and part 2 of a machine, then the oil layer will allow less contact of the two surfaces with each other as you can see in the figure below:

           Question 63.
           <br/>
           Why are cars, aeroplanes and rockets streamlined ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The cars, aeroplanes and rockets are streamlined so as to reduce the fluid friction. The air drag obstructs the vehicle to move forward and the fuel is consumed mainly for opposing this opposite frictional force. Therefore, the objects are given special shape called streamline shape, which itself cuts the air friction.s

           Question 66 A.
           <br/>
           Define friction. What are the factors affecting friction? Explain with examples.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The force that opposes the motion of an object is called friction. Example, when we walk, friction acts in opposite direction we apply force to walk.
          </p>
<p>
           The factor affecting friction are:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            The weight of the object.
           </li>
<li>

<br/>
           The friction is produced due to the contact of the two surfaces of the table and the book. It acts in opposite direction of the force to stop it. And, we see after some distance, the book again comes to the rest (Fig C).

<p>
           Question 67 A.
           <br/>
           Give examples to show that friction depends on the nature of two surfaces in contact.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The friction depends on the roughness as well as smoothness of the surface. If the surface is rough, then the surfaces in contact have more interlockings and the thus the friction is more. Thus, the object is not able to move easily due to more friction.
           <br/>
<img alt="Lakhmir Singh Science Class 8 Solutions Chapter 12 Friction 11" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-121167" height="233" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 349px) 100vw, 349px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Lakhmir-Singh-Science-Class-8-Solutions-Chapter-12-Friction-11.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Lakhmir-Singh-Science-Class-8-Solutions-Chapter-12-Friction-11.png 349w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Lakhmir-Singh-Science-Class-8-Solutions-Chapter-12-Friction-11-300x200.png 300w" width="349"/>
<br/>
           If the surface is smooth, then the surfaces in contact have very less interlockings and the thus the friction is less. Thus, the object is able to move easily due to less friction.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 67 B.
           <br/>
           Give an example to show that friction depends on the force with which the two surfaces are pressed together.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Suppose, a person is pushing a heavy box, then he is applying say force F1.
           <br/>
<img alt="Lakhmir Singh Science Class 8 Solutions Chapter 12 Friction 12" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-121168" height="150" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Lakhmir-Singh-Science-Class-8-Solutions-Chapter-12-Friction-12.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Lakhmir-Singh-Science-Class-8-Solutions-Chapter-12-Friction-12.png 303w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Lakhmir-Singh-Science-Class-8-Solutions-Chapter-12-Friction-12-300x149.png 300w" width="303"/>
<br/>
           Now if the same person pushes two boxes of same mass as the previous case. Then, in this case he will have to apply more force to overcome the larger friction as in the earlier case. Thus is because friction depends on the mass of the object. Heavier the mass, more the force is exerted by the object on the surface and thus more friction is produced.

<p>
           Question 68 A.
           <br/>
           What is the difference between static friction and sliding friction? For’ a given pair of objects, which of the two is greater?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When the body is in stationary state or is at rest, the frictional forces acting on the body is known as static frictional forces.
          </p>
<p>
           But when the object is pushed and it moves, the friction that comes into action is sliding friction.
           <br/>
<img alt="Lakhmir Singh Science Class 8 Solutions Chapter 12 Friction 13" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-121169" height="203" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Lakhmir-Singh-Science-Class-8-Solutions-Chapter-12-Friction-13.png" width="297"/>
<br/>
           The static friciton is greater than sliding friction because more force is required to remove the objectf rom rest state into dynamic state. Once the obejct comes into motion, it is easier to keep the object moving by applying comparetively lesser force.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 68 B.
           <br/>
           How can a very heavy machine be moved conveniently from one place to another in a factory? (No crane is available for this purpose).
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A very heavy machine can be moved from one place to another with the help of wheels. Because then rolling friction comes into action and its value is the least among static and sliding friction.

           Question 79.
           <br/>
           If the static friction between two surfaces X and Y is found to be 20 N, then the rolling friction between these two surfaces should most likely be :
           <br/>
           A. 25 N
           <br/>
           B. 20 N

           Question 82.
           <br/>
           Four similar cars having exactly the same mass are running at the same speed on the same road when brakes are applied at the same time. The cars come to a stop after covering distances of 5 m, 5.5 m, 4.8 m and 5.2 m respectively. The friction between the brake pads and discs will be the maximum in the car which travels the distance of:
           <br/>
           A. 5 m
           <br/>
           B. 5.5 m

           Question 91.
           <br/>
           When a pencil cell is released from a certain point on an inclined wooden board, it travels a distance of 35 cm on floor A before it comes to rest. When the same pencil cell is released from the same point on the same inclined board, it travels a distance of 20 cm on floor B before coming to rest. Which floor, A or B, offers greater friction? Give reason for your answer.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Floor B offers greater friction because it stops the moving pencil cell stop at a lesser distance of 20 cm on the floor. More the friction, more the surface is rough.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 92.

<p>
           Question 93.
           <br/>
           You spill a bucket of soapy water on a marble floor accidently. Would it make easier or more difficult for you to walk on the floor? Why?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           It will make more difficult to walk on the floor. As soapy solution decreases the friction on the floor.
          </p>

           Question 94.
           <br/>
           What kind of friction comes into play:
           <br/>
           (a) when a block of wood kept on table moves slowly ?
           <br/>

           <br/>
           (c) when a block of wood kept on cylindrical iron rods moves?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Sliding friction
           <br/>
<img alt="Lakhmir Singh Science Class 8 Solutions Chapter 12 Friction 17" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-121174" height="99" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Lakhmir-Singh-Science-Class-8-Solutions-Chapter-12-Friction-17.png" width="259"/>

</p>
<p>
           (c) Rolling friction
           <br/>

           Question 95.
           <br/>
           Explain why, it is easier to drag a mat on floor when nobody is sitting on it but much more difficult to drag the same mat when a person is sitting on it.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When no person is sitting on the mat, then the mat and floor are not pressed together.
           <br/>
<img alt="Lakhmir Singh Science Class 8 Solutions Chapter 12 Friction 20" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-121177" height="246" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Lakhmir-Singh-Science-Class-8-Solutions-Chapter-12-Friction-20.png" width="208"/>
<br/>
           Thus, there is no friction.
           <br/>
           But, when a person is sitting on the mat.
           <br/>
<img alt="Lakhmir Singh Science Class 8 Solutions Chapter 12 Friction 21" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-121178" height="194" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Lakhmir-Singh-Science-Class-8-Solutions-Chapter-12-Friction-21.png" width="224"/>
<br/>
           Then due to the weight of the person, the mat and floor are pressed together harder, increasing the friction too much. Thus, then it is very difficult to drag the person.
