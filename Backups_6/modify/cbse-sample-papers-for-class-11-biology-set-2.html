           (b) The gram stain is retained due to the presence of layers of peptidoglycan. The cell wall of gram-negative bacteria contains thin layers of peptidoglycan which is intact with lipoproteins between the double-layered cell wall and dissolves when alcohol is added, hence it doesnâ€™t retain the Gram stain.

           Question 26.
           <br/>
           What is meant by tertiary structure of protein? Why a tertiary structure is essential for a protein? (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The complex three dimensional shape formed by the coiling and folding of helical polypeptide chain is known as a tertiary structure of proteins. Such structure are held together by weak bonds formed between various parts of polypeptide chain. The biological activity of a protein molecule depends largely upon the specific tertiary structure.

           (c) Give their two functions.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           (a) What hormones are secreted by the posterior pituitary gland?
           <br/>
           (i) What function does each serve?
           <br/>
           (ii) Where are these hormones actually produced?
           <br/>
           (b) How are these hormones transported to the region from which they are released?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) LH is secreted by adenohypophysis or anterior pituitary gland.
           <br/>
           (b) FSH is the other hormone (gonadotropin) along with which its target cell.
          </p>
<p>
           Functions of LH:
           <br/>
           (i) In males, it stimulates spermatogenesis.
           <br/>
           (ii) In females, it stimulates ovulation and the formation of the corpus luteum.
          </p>
<p>
           (c) Functions of FSH:
           <br/>
           1. In females, it stimulates the growth of ovarian follicles.
           <br/>
           2. It helps in the regulation of menstrual cycle.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           (a) Oxytocin and vasopressin.
           <br/>
           (i) Oxytocin: It is released into the blood when hypothalamic neurons are stimulated by the widening of the uterus at the time of delivery or by the sucking of breasts by an infant. It induces contraction of smooth muscles of the uterus during the birth of a young one and myoepithelial cells of mammary glands to infant. Therefore, it is also known as â€˜birth hormonesâ€™ and or â€˜milk-ejecting hormonesâ€™.
          </p>
<p>
           Vasopressin: It is also called antidiuretic hormone (ADH). It decreases the loss of water in urine by increasing reabsorption of water in distal convoluted tubules, collecting tubules and collecting ducts of kidneys. It is transported as neurophysin â€“ proteins bound secretory granules down the nerve fibre.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Oxytocin and vasopressin are produced in Hypothalamus and released through posterior pituitary.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) Neurosecretory cells of hypothalamus release the oxytocin and vasopressin to the posterior pituitary lobe of pituitary gland. These hormones are stored and released into the blood from posterior posterior pituitary to the region.

           Question 28.
           <br/>
           What are the conditions required for growth? (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Growth is influenced by a number of conditions which are as follows:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Water is required for cell elongation, maintenance of turgidity of growing cells and providing a medium for enzyme action.
           </li>
<li>
            Oxygen is essential for aerobic respiration and hence the availability of energy for biosynthetic activity.
           </li>
<li>
            Nutrients are raw materials for the synthesis of protoplasm, as well as the source of energy.
           </li>
<li>
            Light is required for tissue differentiation, synthesis of photosynthetic pigments and photosynthesis.
           </li>
<li>
            The optimum temperature for proper growth is 28 â€“ 30Â°C.
           </li>
<li>
            Environmental signals such as light &amp; gravity also affect certain stages of growth.

           (a) Zoospores, aplanospores, hypnospores, stratospores and neutral spores.
           <br/>
           (b)
           <br/>
           (i) Zoospores: They are motile flagellated spores. Zoospore formation takes place during favourable conditions. During their formation, flagella are withdrawn and organisms come to rest. The protoplasm undergoes repeated divisions and forms 8-16 daughter protoplasts. These daughter individuals called zoospore develop their individual cell wall and flagella. The parent cell wall is lost and new individuals attain independent existence.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Aplanospores: These are non-motile asexual spores. They are asexually formed within a cell by the contraction of protoplasm and the formation of new cellulose walls around it. They develop into aplanospores which may either germinate directly or may divide to produce zoospores.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Hypnospores: These are resting spores. In these, the protoplasm withdraws from the cell wall, rounds up and develop a thick wall under unfavourable condition. During favourable condition, they germinate to form new plants.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) Stratospores: These are thick-walled spores produced in diatoms.
          </p>
<p>
           (v) Neutral spores: In some algae, the protoplast of vegetative cells directly function as spores called as neutral spores.
          </p>
<p>
           (c) Zoospores- e.g., Chlamydomonas.
           <br/>
           Aplanospores-. e.g., Spirogyra
           <br/>
           Hypnospores-e.g., Vaucheria.
           <br/>
           Stratospores- eg. Diatoms
           <br/>
           and Neutral spores- e.g., Ectocarpus.
