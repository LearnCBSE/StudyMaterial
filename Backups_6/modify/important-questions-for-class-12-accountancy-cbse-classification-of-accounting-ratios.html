           These ratios measure the profitability of a business assessing the and helps in overall efficiency of the business.
           <br/>
           (i)
           <strong>
            Gross profit ratio
           </strong>
           Gross profit ratio shows the relationship between theÂ gross profit to net sales (revenue from operations)
           <br/>
           Gross Profit Ratio =Gross Profit/Revenue from Operations i.e. Net Sales x 100
           <br/>
           Cost of Revenue from Operations = Opening Inventory (excluding spare parts andÂ loose tools) + Purchases + Direct Expenses â Closing Inventory (excluding spare parts and loose tools)
           <br/>
           In case, statement of profit and loss is given, cost of revenue from operations i.e. cost of goods sold is computed by adding cost of materials consumed, purchases of stock-in-trade, changes in inventories of finished goods, work-in-progress and stock-in-trade and direct expenses
           <br/>
           (ii)
           <strong>
            Net profit ratio
           </strong>
           Net profit ratio shows the relationship between net profit and revenue from operations i.e. net sales. Net profit ratio is an indicator of overall operational efficiency of the business.
           <br/>
           Net Profit Ratio =Net Profit after Tax/Revenue from Operations i. e. Net Sales x 100
           <br/>
           Net Profit = Revenue from Operations â Cost of Revenue from Operations â Operating Expenses â Non-operating Expenses + Non-operating Income + Tax
           <br/>
           (iii)
           <strong>
            Operating ratio
           </strong>
           Operating ratio establishes the relationship between operating cost and revenue from operations i.e. net sales.
           <br/>
           Operating Ratio =Operating Cost/Â Revenue from Operations (Net sales) x 100
           <br/>
           Operating Ratio =Cost of Revenue from Operations + Operating Expenses/Revenue from Operations i.e. Net Sales x 100
           <br/>
           Cost of Goods Sold = Cost of Materials Consumed + Purchases of Stock-in-trade + Change in Inventories of Finished Goods, Work-in-progress and Stock in-trade + Direct Expenses
           <br/>
           or
           <br/>
           Revenue from Operations â Gross Profit.
           <br/>
           Operating Expenses = Employees Benefits Expenses + Other Expenses (Other thanÂ non-operating expenses) + Depreciation and Amortisation Expenses

           or
           <br/>
           Office expenses, administrative expenses, selling and distribution expenses, employees benefit expenses, depreciation and amortisation expenses.
           <br/>
           Alternatively operating cost may be calculated as follows:
           <br/>
           Operating Cost = Cost of Materials Consumed + Purchases of Stock-in-trade + Change in Inventories of Finished Goods, Work-in-progress and Stock-in-trade + Employees Benefits Expenses + Other Expenses (Other than non-operating expenses)
           <br/>
           (iv)
           <strong>
            Operating profit ratio
           </strong>
           Operating profit ratio establishes the relationship between the operating profit and i.e. (revenue from operations) net sales. Operating profit ratio is an indicator of operational efficiency of the business.
           <br/>
           (v)Return on investment/Capital employed It establishes the relationship between net profit before interest, tax and preference dividend and capital employed (equity + debts).
           <br/>
           Return on Investment/Capital Employed=Net Profit before Interest, Tax and Preference Dividend/ Capital Employed x 100
           <br/>
           Capital employed can be calculated from liabilities side approach and assets side approach as follows:
           <br/>
<strong>
            When Liabilities Approach is Followed
           </strong>
           It is computed by adding
           <br/>
           (a)Shareholdersâ funds (i.e. share capital, reserves and surplus).
           <br/>
           (b)Non-current liabilities (i.e. long-term borrowings and long-term provisions).
           <br/>
<strong>
            When Assets Approach is Followed
           </strong>
           It is computed by adding
           <br/>
           (i)Non-current assets, i.e.
           <br/>
           (a)Fixed assets (tangible fixed assets, intangible fixed assets).
           <br/>
           (b)Non-current trade investments.
           <br/>
           (c)Long-term loans and advances.
           <br/>
           (ii)Working capital, i.e. current assets â current liabilities.
           <br/>
<strong>
            NOTE
           </strong>
           Since,non-operating assets are excluded while determining capital employed, income from non-operating assets should also be excluded from profit.
