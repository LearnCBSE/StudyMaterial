           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below carefully:
           <br/>
           Great people are born to produce an
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            influence
           </span>
           on society. One such personality, who was so humble and lived his complete life with determination and purpose to achieve certain aims was Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar. He was a great social reformer, writer, educator and worked endlessly to
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            transform
           </span>
           the society. He strongly protested against polygamy and child marriage. He favoured widow remarriage and women’s education in India. The Widow Remarriage Act was passed in 1856 making the marriage of widows legal because of his efforts to solve these problems.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar refined the way Bengali language was written and taught. His book ‘Bomo Porichoy’ (Introduction to the Alphabet) is still used as the introductory text to teach Bengali alphabet. Thus, he brought about a revolution in the Bengali Education System. Vidyasagar is credited with the role of completely changing the old method of teaching which prevailed in Sanskrit College. As a professor in Sanskrit College, he brought modem outlook into the method of teaching. He included English and Bengali as mediums of learning, besides Sanskrit. He, also, introduced courses in European History, Philosophy and Science alongside Vedic scriptures. He encouraged students to study these subjects and make the best of both the worlds.
          </p>
<p>
           Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar was a strong
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            advocate
           </span>
           of women education. He rightly viewed education as the primary way for women to achieve
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            emancipation
           </span>
           from the society’s oppression they had to face at that time. He exercised his power to open schools for girls and even outlined suitable curriculum to educate them. He went from door to door, requesting heads of families to allow their daughters to be enrolled in schools.
          </p>
<p>
           Ishwar Chandra was a man who defined his own path of action. He never listened to what others said about his work and made decisions based on his own judgement. He was famous for all these qualities. He was also known for his great courage. Vidyasagar had a very soft heart that sympathised with those in trouble. He was easily moved to tears when he saw someone in pain and was always the first one to offer his help to colleagues and
           <br/>
           friends in
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            distress
           </span>
           . After his death, Rabindranath Tagore said, “One wonders how God, in the process of producing forty million Bengalis, produced a man!”

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below:
           <br/>
           I. The Nobel Prize is an international award administered by the Nobel Foundation and is based on the fortune of Alfred Nobel, a Swedish inventor and entrepreneur. The Nobel prize is awarded for the best contribution in the fields of Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, Literature and to the person who has contributed by and large to bring Peace on Earth. In 1968, Sweden’s central bank established the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in memory of Alfred Nobel.
          </p>
<p>
           II. A look into the history of the recipients of the award reveals that only 57 women have received the award compared to 873 male recipients. There are various historical reasons for why this is the case, but the trend appears to be improving.
          </p>
<p>
           III. Goran Hansson, the permanent secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said , ” While more women are being recognised now compared with previous decades, only about 10% of the professors in natural sciences in western Europe or North America are women, and even lower if you go to east Asia.” All over the world, the number of men working in STEM fields is much higher than the number of women.

<br/>
           IV. Hansson emphasised that they have made sure to identify the problem and also learn about subconscious bias in the prize-awarding committees and academies. “We’ve had lectures by sociologists, we’ve had group discussions, we have put quite a lot of effort into it,” he said.
          </p>
<p>
           V. “In the end, we will give the prize to those who are found the most worthy, those who have made the most important contributions,” he added. (261 words)

           Subject: Concern regarding large number of accidents in metropolitan cities
          </p>
<p>
           Sir
           <br/>
           Through the medium of the columns of your esteemed newspaper wish to express my concern over the large number of accidents taking place everyday. There are a number of reasons for this incessant rise in the number of accidents. The main reason being that most drivers are quite stressed while driving due to the adverse and erratic driving conditions. Poor road conditions make them impatient and they often lose their cool and drive recklessly and rashly. People also do not follow traffic rules nor do they adhere to speed limits thus leading to accidents. Mobile phones and loud music act as distractions. People are always in a hurry to reach their destination and as a result drive most recklessly. There is also an unfortunate increase in the number of drunken driving mishaps.
          </p>
<p>
           To solve this problem the authorities need to take very stringent action and impose very heavy fines on traffic rule defaulters. Underage drivers and drunken drivers should be dealt with most severely and their licenses should be impounded immediately. I suggest that the number of traffic policemen and check-posts be increased to act as deterrents. It is also important that at the time of issuing driving licenses, a comprehensive class on traffic rules and regulations should be made mandatory.
          </p>
<p>
           I hope you will publish my letter in your newspaper so as to bring the attention of the concerned authorities towards this problem and enable them to take strict measures to bring down the rising number of accidents.
          </p>

<p>
           Sir
           <br/>
           Through the medium of this letter I would like to bring to your notice my complaint of receiving damaged books. I had ordered two books from you from the Harry Potter series on 18th April, 20xx, the payment for which I had made by a Demand Draft. I wanted to gift these books to my friend on her birthday. On receiving the books yesterday I was extremely disappointed to see their pathetic condition. The cover pages of the books are damaged and the inner pages too are turned and untidy. My friend’s birthday is on the 30th of April and I cannot present these damaged books to her. So I request you to send me new packs of both the books at the earliest. I am also sending back the damaged books to you. Awaiting a favourable response and prompt delivery of the new books.
          </p>
<p style="text-align: right;">

           Write a paragraph in not more than 120 words, analysing the listed responses to the situation when one faces setbacks.
           <br/>
           Or, [B] Read the following excerpt from an article that appeared in a local daily.
           <br/>
           The by-laws of some residential associations and management that ban owners and tenants from keeping pets in their apartments, are justified.
           <br/>
           Write a paragraph to analyse the given argument.
           <br/>
           You could think about what alternative explanations might weaken the given conclusion and include rationale/evidence that would strengthen/ counter the given argument. 8
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           [A] Setbacks often leave one with a feeling of disappointment and sometimes even worse. The concept chart displays two ways to handle setbacks – Healthy and Inability to process. Healthy processing helps one to learn and let go of the emotions inside. On the other hand, Inability to process leads to a block feeling, self-criticism and selfdoubt. An optimistic way of seeing a setback processes the ability to feel, reflect, learn and align. Whereas a negative perspective of a failure can lead to listlessness, diverted attention, excessive rumination and not accepting failures’. It is evident that experiencing a setback leads to feelings of inadequacy and incompetency along with an unwillingness to accept situations. Responding to setbacks the positive way is empowering as it leads to success.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           [B] The by-laws of some residential associations and management ban owners and tenants from keeping pets in their apartments. This law is rather unreasonable and overstated and should be countered. Keeping pets at home has several benefits. They help to improve your mood and temperament. Pets, especially dogs, can be great companions, they act as antidotes to loneliness and even guard the house. Their love is selfless and unconditional and they are always faithful. Pets are also known to reduce stress and anxiety levels. Moreover, kids who grow up with pets at home are always caring and respectful towards living beings. Pets need love and attention but that is a small price to pay for the numerous benefits they bring in our life.

           Answer the following questions in 30-40 words each. 2 × 5 = 10
           <br/>
           (a) Which two issues about himself convinced Lomov of his decision to get married?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Lomov is convinced that he should get married because he is expected to do so and cannot stay unmarried. He feels he ought to lead a quiet, settled and regular life at the critical age of thirty-five. Moreover, he needs a partner as he suffers from palpitations, is excitable and is always getting awfully upset.
          </p>
<p>

           Mrs. Pumphrey began to cry loudly when Dr. Herriot carried Tricki in a blanket to his car. She gave out a despairing cry when the doctor moved off with Tricki.
          </p>
<p>
           The entire staff was roused and maids were rushed in and out bringing Tricki’s day bed, night bed, favourite cushions, toys and bowls. As Dr. Herriot drove away with Tricki, Mrs. Pumphrey, with a despairing cry, threw an armful of little coats through the window.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A crow shaking down a dust of snow on the poet from the hemlock tree has changed the poet’s mood. This dust of snow stands for hope and joy in the midst of snow.
          </p>
<p>
           (d) Comment on the tone of the speaker when she says ‘Will you please look at me when I’m speaking to you, Amanda!’.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When the speaker says, ‘Will you please look at me when I’m speaking to you, Amanda!’ her tone is one of frustration and annoyance because she feels that Amanda is not paying attention to what is being told to her. She is exasperated and frustrated at not being taken seriously by Amanda.

           (e) A ballad includes the telling of a tale as well as a surprise ending. Using evidence from the poem, explain how these features are included in ‘The Tale of Custard the Dragon’.
           <br/>
           Answer:

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Answer the following questions in about 100 – 150 words. 8
           <br/>
           In the lesson ‘A Letter to God’, what moral values does the postmaster display in his behaviour?
           <br/>
           Or,
           <br/>
           Pranjol and Rajvir discuss their next vacation destination. They shortlist Coorg and Goa. Rajvir is keen on Coorg and tries to convince Pranjol. Develop a conversation between the two, based on your understanding of Glimpses of India. 4
           <br/>
           You may begin like this:
           <br/>
           Rajvir: Hey Pranjol! I think we should be visiting Coorg. It is a beautiful place with coffee plantations. I can smell the aroma already!
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The postmaster was very impressed and touched by Lencho’s sincere faith in God. In order to reconfirm and not to shake Lencho’s faith he decided to answer the letter. He is amazed to read Lencho’s letter and even more amazed at Lencho’s abundant faith in God. The postmaster is thus a very genuine, empathetic and soft hearted man. The postmaster is also a man who sticks to his resolutions so he is able to collect money for Lencho’s help. Since he commands the respect of his juniors and friends they too feel obliged to give him money for an act of charity. He is a generous person and tries to percieve others in a more positive light.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Rajvir: Hey Pranjol! I think ive should be visiting Coorg. It is a beautiful place with coffee plantations. I can already smell the aroma of coffee.
           <br/>
           Pranjol: We visited a tea plantation last year in Assam. Now I want to go to Goa.
           <br/>
           Rajvir: There is a lot more to do in Coorg than see the coffee plantations. The place has rainforests so the fauna will be worth watching. Moreover, Coorg also provides opportunities for adventure sports like river rafting, canoeing, rappelling, rock climbing and mountain biking.
           <br/>
           Pranjol: That sounds interesting, but I would prefer an exciting holiday and some serene moments after this post-pandemic gloomy scenario.
           <br/>
           Rajvir: Then we should just consider going to Coorg.
           <br/>
           Pranjol: You really think so?
           <br/>
           Rajvir: Believe me, Coorg has a serene environment that reflects peace and spirituality.
           <br/>
           Pranjol: You really have done quite a research on the place.
           <br/>
           Rajvir: Yes, I have. Coorgi homes have a tradition of hospitality and they are willing to recount tales of valour related to their sons and fathers. Even now Kodavus are the only people in India permitted to carry firearms without a licence. It would be fun to meet such bravehearts.

           Question 11.
           <br/>
           Answer the following questions in about 100 – 150 words. 8
           <br/>
           Why did Hari Singh decide to return the stolen money? What light does it throw on his character?
           <br/>
           Or,
           <br/>
           Which of the two thieves lacked ‘honour’ in the story ‘A Question of Trust’? Who according to
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           After stealing the money when Hari Singh reached the station, he just could not board the train. He stood alone on the deserted platform and thought about Anil who he knew would feel only sadness for the loss of trust when he discovered the theft. When the train had gone, he did not know where to go. The only place he could think of going to, was the house of the person he had robbed. As he sat down to think deeply sitting under the clock tower, he realised that he would actually miss being with Anil – cooking his meals and running to the bazaar. He felt that he should go back to Anil if only to read and write. So he decided to return to Anil feeling very nervous. The thief was very grateful to Anil and quite liked working for him. Since Anil was the most trusting man he had met, he could not cheat him. The thief was indeed a person whose conscience was alive and he realised the difference between right and wrong.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           The young, pretty lady who was dressed in red and was also a thief lacked ‘honour’ because she had cheated and deceived Horace. Though Horace and the lady had the same motive when they came to the house at Shotover Grange, the real culprit in this story is not Horace but the young lady. She plans her moves so accurately and immorally and escapes scot-free with all the jewels putting the entire theft on Horace’s name. She pretended to be the owner of the house and made Horace steal the jewels for her. Eager to get free and to avoid going to the prison, Horace agreed to break open the safe for her so that she could get the jewels, which he assumed belonged to her. To buy his freedom, Horace handed over the jewels to her and, ironically, this act led to his arrest. His fingerprints were all over the room. His story, that the lady of the house had asked him to open the safe for her, was termed as ‘nonsense’ and he landed in the prison.
