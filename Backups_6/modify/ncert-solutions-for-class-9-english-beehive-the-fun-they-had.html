<strong>
            III. Answer each of these questions in a short paragraph (about 30 words).
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           What kind of teachers did Margie and Tommy have?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Margie and Tommy had mechanical teachers. They were taught on computers and television screens. They didn’t have a living person as a teacher who would teach the pupils in a classroom.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Why did Margie’s mother send for the County Inspector?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Margie’s mother sent for the County Inspector because the mechanical teacher was not functioning efficiently. It had been giving her test after test in geography and she had been doing worse and worse.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           What did he do?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           He slowed down the mechanical teacher’s speed upto an average ten-year level. The mechanical teacher’s speed was controlled and adjusted according to the IQ level of Margie.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Why was Margie doing badly in geography? What did the County Inspector do to help her?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Margie had been doing badly in geography. This was because the mechanical teacher was very fast in displaying the questionnaire. The County Inspector adjusted its speed upto an average ten-year level. Thus, the mechanical teacher’s speed was controlled appropriately. The County Inspector assured that the overall pattern of Margie’s progress was quite satisfactory.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           What had once happened to Tommy’s teacher?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Tommy’s teacher was taken away for nearly a month because the history sector had blanked out completely. So, Tommy had nothing to do during that period. He only relaxed and enjoyed.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 6.
           <br/>
           Did Margie have regular days and hours for school? If so, why?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Yes, Margie had regular days and hours for school because her mother said little girls learned better if they learned at regular hours.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 7.
           <br/>
           How does Tommy describe the old kind of school?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Tommy says that the old schools were different. They had a special building and all the kids went there to study. They laughed and shouted in the schoolyard. They enjoyed time together and learned lessons together in a classroom.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 8.
           <br/>
           How does he describe the old kind of teachers?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           He says that the old teachers did not live in the house. They had a special building and all the kids went there. They gave homework to students. They were not mechanical teachers, but living human beings.

            IV. Answer each of these questions in two or three paragraphs. (100-150 words).

<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           What are the main features of the mechanical teachers and the schoolrooms that Margie and Tommy have in the story?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Margie and Tommy have mechanical teachers. They need not go to school for getting a formal education. The mechanical teacher is placed in one of the rooms of the house and they can get the knowledge of various subjects of individually from the mechanical teacher. They don’t have such classrooms where students sit together. They study from the telebooks. So they don’t require books and exercise books. The examination system is very different. They do homework in a different way. Margie has to write them out in a punch code. She leamt it when she was six years old. So the system of their education is technologically advanced and not based on printed books.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Why did Margie hate school? Why did she think the old kind of school must have been fun?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Margie hated her school because she had a mechanical teacher. It was in her house. She was supposed to sit in that room alone to complete her hometask or assignments. The part Margie hated most was the slot where she had to put homework and test papers. She thought that the old schools must have been fun because the students used to sit together in the classroom. They enjoyed, laughed and shouted in the schoolyard. Children needed company to enhance their skills. If they are isolated, they get depressed and dejected.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Do you agree with Margie that schools today are more fun than the school in the story? Give reasons for your answer.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           There is no doubt that today’s schools are more funny than the future school discussed in the story. This school has nothing but a mechanical teacher with no emotions and sentiments. It does not have the ability to understand the psychology of a child. Moreover, it guides a pupil according to its adjusted modes. But today’s schools work for the overall development of a child. They learn the same thing. The teaches are real human beings. They leam how to adapt themselves to the new surroundings and cope with the strangers. The students sit and leam together. These activities don’t give vent to the feelings of depression, alienation and segregation.

           They had once taken Tommy’s teacher away for nearly a month because the history sector had blanked out completely. The word complete is an adjective. When you add -ly to it, it becomes an adverb.

<p>
<strong>
            II. If not and Unless
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           • Imagine that Margie’s mother told her, “You’ll feel awful if you don’t finish your history lesson.”
           <br/>
           • She could also say: “You’ll feel awful unless you finish your history lesson.” Unless means if not. Sentences with unless or if not are negative conditional sentences.
          </p>
<p>
           Notice that these sentences have two parts. The part that begins with if not or unless tells us the condition. This part has a verb in the present tense (look at the verbs don’t finish, finish in the sentences above).
          </p>
<p>
           The other part of the sentence tells us about a possible result. It tells us what will happen (if something else doesn’t happen). The verb in this part of the sentence is in the future tense (you ’ll feelI you will feel).
          </p>
<p>
           Notice these two tenses again in the following examples:

           Question 2:
           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>
           It was a very old book. Margie’s grandfather once said that when he was a little boy his grandfather told him that there was a time when all stories were printed on paper. They turned the pages, which were yellow and crinkly, and it was awfully funny to read words that stood still instead of moving the way they were supposed to-on a screen.

<br/>
</strong>
           Margie went into the schoolroom. It was right next to her bedroom and the mechanical teacher was on and waiting for her. It was always on at the same time every day except Saturday and Sunday because her mother said little girls learned better if they learned at regular hours.

           Question 6:
           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>
           Margie did so with a sigh. She was thinking about the old schools they had when her grandfather’s grandfather was a little boy. All the kids from the whole neighbourhoods came, laughing and shouting in the schoolyard, sitting together in the schoolroom going home together at the end of the day. They learned the same things, so that they could help one another with the home work and talk about it.

<li>
            The advantage of the old school was that everyone used to learn the same thing and could help each other in the homework. The children could go and come together also.

           Answer:
           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>

           Answer:
           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>

           </strong>
<br/>
           Answer:
           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>

           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>
           How does Tommy describe the old kind of teachers ?
           <strong>
            (Board Term 1,2012, ELI-025)
           </strong>
<br/>
           Answer:
           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>
           Earlier, the teachers were not mechanical teachers, they taught the children in a special building where all children went to learn. They asked questions and gave them home work.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 10:
           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>
           Why did Margie find the book strange ?
           <strong>
            (Board Term 1,2012, ELI-026)
           </strong>
<br/>
           Answer:
           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>
           The book had yellow and crinkly pages and the words standing still unlike moving on a screen. When they turned back to the pages read before, there were the same words on it when they read it the first time. All these things were strange for Margie.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 11:
           <strong>
<br/>

<br/>
           Answer:
           <strong>
<br/>

<br/>
</strong>
           In spite of all comforts and luxuries in today’s world, our grandparents still cherish their own time when life was quite tough. Give your own views regarding this in 80-100 words.

           Answer:
           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>
           Our grand parents lived during the years of 1950s to 1970s. At that time life was very simple yet tough. They had time to explore the surroundings and the world. They had parks to play with less of pollution around them. Mechanical gadgets were there but were used only for necessary activities. There were rivers where they could go for picnics and treks without the fear of being getting any allergy. The school was more of a fun place where they met their friends. They studied but were not competing against each other. For them togetherness was important rather than competition.
           <br/>
           In today’s world we are competiting against our friends. We have all the facilities of life but we do not have time for our family and friends. We like to play but on computers and play station rather than with our sibilings and friends.

           Question 2:
           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>
           How was Margie’s school different from the schools that existed hundreds of years ago ?
           <strong>
            (Board Term 1,2012, ELI-030)
           </strong>
<br/>
           Answer:
           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>
           Margie’s school was at home. She had a mechanical teacher, telebooks, no other students were there in the class and work was fed in by the mechanical teacher by punch codes. Whereas, the old schools had proper buildings, many students, human teachers who gave homework and asked questions. Everyone learned the same things and books were of paper. So, it is clearly visible that Margie’s school was totally different from the schools that existed hundreds of years ago.
          </p>

           How is Margie’s school different from a normal school ?
           <strong>
            (Board Term 1,2012, ELI-038)
           </strong>
<br/>
           Answer:
           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>
           Margie’s school had a room installed with a computer from which she used to learn the lessons. There were no teachers to teach die students. No homework was given to the students. The computers gave them tests and the results were given instantly. There was no one to do the corrections or solve their problems. There were no classmates even. So, Margie’s school was very different from a normal school.

           Answer:
           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>
           A teacher not only has to teach and explain things but also has to understand the mindset of the students. A computer instructor will only be able to deliver the lesson but will not be able to understand the problems of the students. A teacher (human) emotionally connects to the students to make the child comfortable but this is not the case with a mechanical teacher. Teaching can be best done by a person because then only will they be able to pass on the correct values and lessons to the students.
