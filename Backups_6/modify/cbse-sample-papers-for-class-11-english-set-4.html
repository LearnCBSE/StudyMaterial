            1. Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follow: (10)
           </span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
           A man, his vision and his message
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           1. A.E J. Abdul Kalam was a multifaceted personality, a statesman and visionary and above all a good human being. He was a brilliant scientist and modern thinker. When I joined him as Press Secretary after 10 days of his becoming President, at his very first meeting he gave me his vision of a developed India.
          </p>
<p>
           He spoke of how he wanted to make Rashtrapati Bhavan a people’s place where voice of the millions of downtrodden people of India would be heard and action taken. Indeed during his time Rashtrapati Bhavan became a people’s place and he became popular as People’s President. He Wanted that institution of the President to be totally identified by ordinary people.
          </p>
<p>
           2. President Kalam took his Presidency seriously from day one. He was as comfortable with constitutional and legal issues as he was with school children. He was committed to nation-building and created a vision document to make India a developed nation by 2020. He made a power point presentation to senior ministers and bureaucrats on this.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           3. He used to make power point presentations at conferences and seminars both in India and abroad to discuss that vision. On these, he used to work himself and he was very particular about every word and sentence.
          </p>
<p>
<img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 11 English Set 4 with Solutions" height="16" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Learn-CBSE.png" width="116"/>
</p>
<p>
           4. He did it during his visits abroad and while meeting dignitaries such as US President George Bush and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf. When he presented his vision of India’s nuclear energy requirements to Mr. Bush and his vision of a joint fight India and Pakistan could wage against poverty, the respective Presidents commented that they had to become scientists to understand the presentation. You can’t think of any other President of a country who would have done that.
          </p>
<p>
           5. His vision for the nation was based on equality, the dignity of the individual and justice, social, economic and political, to every Indian. Only then can India succeed and everybody sing the song of India, he used to say.
          </p>
<p>
           6. I met him last on July 22, five days before his demise. It was an one-on-one meeting that lasted a good 40 minutes. He was full of ideas as always, very active and discussed different subjects. He used to tell me, “Whatever you do, do differently. Wherever you work, leave a mark and be remembered.”
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           7. During his presidency he was always comfortable, except on two occasions, when his unease was visible. When he had to give his consent to the Office of Profit Bill, 2006 after it was sent for the second time by the Parliament and when he had to approve the ordinance on Disqualification of Elected Representatives in 2004 as it was sent to him by the Cabinet for a second time.
          </p>
<p>
           8. He was an icon for the youth. He used to say “Aiming small is a crime. Youth should have the courage to think differently and explore unexplored paths. Difficulties would come but don’t be afraid of them— overcome them with your intellect and hard work.”
          </p>
<p>
           9. The man who pioneered India’s missile programme was always proud of his work at the Indian Space Research Organisation and other scientific institutions. He used to believe that a scientific approach could find a solution to every problem.
          </p>
<p>
           10. He was an ardent secularist and also a religious man. He believed that all religions are like beautiful islands; but there is no connectivity between them. We should strive to achieve this connectivity and transform religion into spirituality. For him religion and morality were the same.
          </p>
<p>
<img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 11 English Set 4 with Solutions" height="16" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Learn-CBSE.png" width="116"/>
</p>
<p>
           11. A man of vision, he always worked in mission mode. He had a mission to meet 10 lakh students and interact with them. He completed this when he left Rashtrapati Bhavan. He continued with this till his last breath. His child-like simplicity was an instant hit.
          </p>
<p>
           12. He got the sobriquet of being the People’s President because of his humility and accessibility. President Kalam always worked towards building consensus rather than ramming down decisions.
          </p>
<p>
           13. He came from a modest background, but educated himself and worked hard to rise to the top. He was simply the missile man whose books were prime-sellers, whose lectures were always house full. He was adored by children as he would give them easy-to-digest messages.
          </p>

           My First-Ever Roller Coaster Ride
          </p>
<p>
           I have come to a theme park to meet roller coaster enthusiast Jay Murray, to find out what makes these rides so popular. Jay estimates he has been on 700 rides in the past 10 years, and is surprised that I have never been on one. He says that one of the attractions of these rides is that you feel out of control, but safe. Jay really wanted to emphasise the importance of safety. “All rides are tested for 1,000 hours before they open to the public,” he said.
          </p>
<p>
           “They also do a test run on every ride each morning, and there’s a thorough annual inspection too.”
           <br/>
           Roller coasters first appeared in 17th-century Russia. These were sloping structures up to 15 metres high, built of wood, with a layer of ice on the surface which people would slide down. Roller coasters with wheeled sledges were developed soon afterwards.
          </p>
<p>
           Later, in Pennsylvania, in the USA, a train that had been used to deliver coal was converted to carry passengers on day trips. This gave a man called LaMarcus Thompson the idea to open a park with pleasure rides at Coney Island, New York. A school teacher by profession, he had the eye of a designer, and the mind of a businessman. In just three weeks, he raised enough money from the rides to pay for the cost of building the park.
          </p>
<p>
           By 1888, Thompson had built nearly 50 roller coasters around the USA and Europe. He introduced new technologies such as cables to pull trains uphill, but it was another man, John Miller, who came up with a design for an under friction wheel, which kept trains firmly attached to the rails. This meant that they could go faster and on steeper tracks, without falling off. This invention appeared in 1912.
          </p>
<p>
           Name of ride Country Height Total cost Maximum speed Tower of Terror Australia 115 metres A 16 million 161 kilometres per hour Formula Rossa United Arab Emirates 52 metres £19.5 million 240 kilometres per hour Steel Dragon Japan 97 metres US $52 million 153 kilometres per hour However, there are limits to the physical forces that a person can tolerate on a ride. People can cope more easily with the positive vertical – the feeling of being pressed into their seat – than the negative vertical, which pushes them out of it.’
          </p>
<p>
           Interestingly, Jay points out that the desire to make roller coaster rides higher and faster is slowly being replaced by a trend towards more complex rides, which offer a more lasting experience. Jay explains: “A world-famous ride such as Kingda Ka (in the USA) is over in less than ten seconds.
          </p>
<p>
           Although such a ride is thrilling, and gives you a rush of adrenaline, there is an alternative. You can try a ride like Helix (in Sweden), which lasts for two minutes – it’s my number one at the moment.” All the same, Jay was eager for me to experience ‘air time’ – the moment when you reach the top and hang, weightless, before plunging down the other side. And when I finally did, I had to admit that it was fantastic!

            3. Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follows:
           </span>
</p>
<p>
           1. Humour is infectious. The sound of roaring laughter is far more contagious than any cough, sniffle, or sneeze. When laughter is shared, it binds people together and increases happiness and intimacy. Best of all, this priceless medicine is fun, free, and easy to use.
          </p>
<p>
           2. The ability to laugh, play, and have fun with others not only makes life more enjoyable but also helps you solve problems. People who incorporate humour and play into their daily lives find that it renews them and all of their relationships.
          </p>
<p>
           3. Life brings challenges that can either get the best of you or become playthings for your imagination. When you “become the problem” and take yourself too seriously, it can be hard to think outside the box and find new solutions. But when you play with the problem, you can often transform it into an opportunity for creative learning.
          </p>
<p>
           4. Playing with problems seems to come naturally to children. When they are confused or afraid, they make their problems into a game, giving them a sense of control and an opportunity to experiment with new solutions. Interacting with others in playful ways helps you retain this creative ability.
          </p>
<p>
           5. As laughter, humour, and play become an integrated part of your life, your creativity will flourish and new discoveries will occur to you daily. Humour takes you to a higher place where you can view the world from a more relaxed, positive, creative, joyful, and balanced perspective.
           <br/>
           (a) On the basis of your reading the passage, make notes using recognisable abbreviations wherever necessary.
           <br/>
           Use a format you consider suitable, supply a suitable title. (5)
           <br/>
           (b) Make a short summary of the passage in about 80 words. (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Laughter – A PRICELESS MEDICINE
           <br/>

           (b) Summary
           <br/>
           Laughter is free, yet a priceless medicine. It makes the body healthy. Humour helps build better relationships. Problems are best solved by developing a child-like attitude of playing with them rather than brooding over them. Laughter should be an integral part of life to make it relaxed, positive and balanced.

The sentence structure is correct, with subject (“we”) followed by the helping verb (“do”) and the object (“product”), while the prepositional phrase “from the forests” provides additional context about the source of the product in question.
          </p>
<p>
           (c) He had not known about my winning a medal until I told him.
           <br/>
           Explanation: The rearranged sentence conveys that the speaker did not have any knowledge of “him” winning a medal until the speaker informed “him” about it. The past perfect tense suggests that the lack of knowledge occurred in the past, before the moment the speaker shared the information.

           Question 8.
           <br/>
           Outdoor exercise or morning and evening walks during winter months have become difficult in the polluted atmosphere of the metropolitan cities. In such a situation, indoor (team) games have become very important. Write a speech in 120-150 words persuading your students to make more use of facilities for basketball, badminton, etc. available in your school. You are the Principal of the school. (5)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Importance of Indoor Games
           <br/>
           Good morning my dear students, it is a known fact that if you want to keep yourself fit and healthy, you must play games. Playing games of any sort not only helps you gaining physical fitness, but it also helps you getting rid of psychological issues. There are two types of games available i.e. outdoor games and indoor games.
          </p>
<p>
           Usually, most of the people assume that playing outdoor games is better than playing games indoor, but it is not essential every time. The biggest advantage of playing indoor games is that you can play these games irrespective of an unsuitable weather.
          </p>
<p>
           Unlike traditional outdoor games can’t be affected by changing weather condition. As we all know that the level of air pollution is increasing day by day. You all know the reasons behind it and I need not explain them to you. We all talk about the benefits of morning and so on. But dear students, do you think that now the air is really fresh? The answer is a big ‘No’. Breathing in such air can lead to many respiratory diseases.
          </p>
<p>
           However, the School Management has decided to introduce many indoor games like Handball, Table Tennis, Chess, Board games, etc., in the school. The students who are willing to pursue their career as sports persons must take part in these games. However, I must say that all the students should take part in these games to maintain their health and also for recreation.

<br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Say No to Plastics
           <br/>
           Respected Principal, teachers and my fellow students, good morning to all. Today, I, XYZ of class XI, am going to present my views on the topic, ‘Say No to Plastics’. Everyone today is quite aware of the non-biodegradable nature of the plastics or polythene bags. People find them very convenient so they are used in abundance. But everyone should realise the negative impact that they are having on our environment.
          </p>
<p>
           They are causing havoc to it. It is an essential duty of each and every citizen of the country to make the environment clean and a healthy place to live in. Keeping pace with the prime motive, the foremost duty of everyone is to say ‘no’ to these bags.
          </p>
<p>
           Everyone must be made aware of the hazardous ill-effects of polythene bags in polluting our environment. The use of these polythene or plastics should be discontinued permanently. Instead of plastic bags, cloth bags or jute bags should be used. Using paper bags or cardboard boxes, where possible, is the best option. It is a must to save our environment from being contaminated further.
           <br/>
           Thank you.
          </p>

           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Career Counsellor (not you, yourself) is the best person to guide you in the choice of a career Write a debate in 10 – 150 words either for or against the motion. (5)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A Career Counsellor (not you, Yourself) is the best person to guide you in the choice of a career Good Morning Judges, Teachers and Students, I take this opportunity to present my position in favour of the topic. In my view a Career Counsellor is the best person to guide you in the choice of a career.
          </p>
<p>
           Whether it is a choice between the Streams in Class XI or choosing from many diverse subjects in college, we all get a lot of advice from friends, family and well- wishers but then too much advice means more confusion. A person who has a thorough knowledge of all available options and who can guide us best through experience is the Career Counsellor.
          </p>
<p>
           He or she is best equipped to give us advice and information about the best course or career to pursue according to our skills and aptitude. The world is developing at a very rapid rate and this is generating multiple choices of diverse courses and careers. This is also creating plenty of confusion. To solve the doubts one needs to approach a person who is familiar with all the changes and is up lo date with the most modern developments.
          </p>
<p>
           A Career Counsellor not only provides multiple options to choose from, but also guides us according to our inclinations and capabilities. They also conduct Self Assessment Tests to understand the aptitude of the candidates. This goes a long way in guiding us to choose our dream career. In my opinion, one should always rely on a Career Counsellor to take the most important decision of their life.

           Should Schools Promote Coaching Institutes?
          </p>
<p>
           Respected members of the jury, principal, teachers and dear friends, a pleasant morning to you all. Today I, Sahil of Xi C, have got the golden opportunity to express my views against the motion ‘Should Schools Promote Coaching Instituter Promotion of the Coaching Institutes by the schools has become a recent trend.
          </p>
<p>
           Teachers from Coaching Institutes visit the schools to teach the so called difficult subjects like Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics whereas English and Physical Education continue to be taught by the school faculty. Where are schools driving to?
          </p>
<p>
           Is that a hint that the school faculty cannot teach the subject and so they hire the service of Coaching Centres or some commercial mind setup is working behind it? CBSE has banned any such practice in schools, but some schools are still continuing with the practice. This is putting an extra burden on the students as well as parents. The students cannot focus on the routine timetable of school and concentrate only on the exam- oriented schedule.
          </p>

<p>
           They don’t study the regular course prescribed by the Board, hence they are deprived of the basic knowledge which a child should get at this stage. These integrated courses also cut a hole in the pocket of parents who have to bear the brunt of financial burden as these Coaching Classes charge a high fees.
          </p>
<p>
           Therefore, it will be appreciable if the Government looks into the matter and takes strict action against the schools running such courses. The parents should also take a step forward and refuse to let their children join these courses. They must avoid falling into the trap of such courses.
           <br/>
           Thank You.
