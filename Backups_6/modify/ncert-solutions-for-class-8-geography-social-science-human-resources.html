           Class 8 Geography Chapter 6 Human Resource Ncert Textbook Questions Solved
          </h3>
<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Answer the following questions.
           <br/>
           (i) Why are people considered a resource?
           <br/>
           (ii) What are the causes for the uneven distribution of population in the world?
           <br/>
           (iii) The world population has grown very rapidly. Why?
           <br/>
           (iv) Discuss the role of any two factors influencing population change.
           <br/>
           (v) What is meant by population composition?
           <br/>
           (vi) What are population pyramids ? How do they help in understanding about the population of a country?
           <br/>
           Answer.
           <br/>
           (i) Human beings are the most important resource of a nation. They are significant because had they not utilised their brains, the other resources of nature would not have found any utility. In other words, human resource is the ultimate resource.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Population density depends on the climate conditions and topography of the place, like few people live in high latitude areas, tropical deserts, mountainous ‘terrains, and forest areas,whereas a large number of people reside in plains. Fertility of soils, availability of fresh water, minerals are other major geographical factors behind this. Some social factors that boost the density of population in a region are better housing, education and health facilities. Places with cultural or historical significance are usually populated. Employment opportunities are another attraction for large chunks of population.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           (iii) Because of the better food supplies, increase in medical facilities, reduced death rate, birth rate almost remaining the same.
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            The difference between birth rate and death rate is called natural growth rate. This natural growth is high due to better medical and food facilities leading to growth in population.
           </li>
<li>
            Many people move from one country to another due to various reasons. This also leads to increase in population of the countries having his immigration.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           (iv) Geographical factors: People prefer to live on plains more than mountains or plateaus and they live more in moderate climates than extreme hot or cold. From the agriculture point of view, fertile lands are preferred. Areas with mineral deposits are more populated.
           <br/>
           Economic factors: People prefer to industrial areas since they provide more and better employment opportunities. Due to this, industrial cities are thickly populated.
          </p>
<p>
           (v) The structure of the population with various respects like age, sex, literacy, occupations, health facilities, economic condition, etc is called population composition.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           (vi) Population pyramid is also called age sex pyramid. It shows:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            It shows division of population into various age groups like 5 to 9 years, 10 to 14 years etc.
           </li>
<li>
            It gives the percentage of male female ratio, in each age group.
           </li>
<li>
            It tells about number of dependents-young and old along with number of economically active peoples.
           </li>
<li>
            It helps to understand the economic, health, social structure by indirectly referring to death, birth rate in terms of age and sex.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           (vii) A population pyramid in which the base is broad and the top part is narrow means that although a large amount of births take place, not all grow up to be adults and old; it means many die before reaching these ages. This indicates a large death rate and Kenya shows such a pyramid. This means a high population growth rate.
           <br/>
           In countries like India, the death rate is decreasing, so the pyramid is broad in the younger age groups, and the size of the pyramid decreases steadily.
          </p>

           Answer:
           <br/>
           The society with too many under 15s need more schools to be able to educate them. There should be efficient and laborious teachers. There should be provisions for items necessary for a child’s amusement, like toys. Children are prone to diseases; facilities for hospitals should be improved in such a society.
           <br/>
           In a society with too few under 15s will have more and more mature people. Pension schemes will work there fruitfully. There may be the need for wheelchairs. Labour supply will be easier. These people will also need hospitals.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Around 61% of the world’s population lives in Asia, 12% in Europe, 13% in Africa, 8% in Central/South America, 5% in North America, and 1% in Oceania.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           If 600 people live in your colony, and the area of your colony is 2 sq km, what is the population density of your colony?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           If 600 people live in a 2 sq km area, on average, 300 people live in 1 sq km. So the density of the population is 300 persons per sq km.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>

          </h4>
<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Describe how various factors affect population distribution.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Topography, favourable climate, the fertility of soils, availability of freshwater, minerals are major geographical factors affecting the population density of a region.
           <br/>
           People prefer to live on plains more than mountains or plateaus and they live more in moderate climates than extreme hot or cold. From the agricultural point of view, fertile lands are preferred. Areas with mineral deposits are more populated. Some social factors that boost the density of the population in a region are better housing, education, and health facilities. Places with cultural or historical significance are usually populated. Employment opportunities are another attraction for large chunks of the population.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Describe how the population of the world has grown in history. What has caused the population explosion?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The world population grew steadily initially. It reached a billion in the year 1820. But the next two billion were added in just a hundred and fifty years. By 1970 the population was 3 billion. In the next 29 years, i.e. by the year 1999, the population had
           <br/>
           doubled to 6 billion. The population explosion has been mainly caused by the growth in medical facilities, which has decreased the death rate to a large extent.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           What are the factors affecting the population change in a region? [Imp.]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Factors affecting the population change in a region are birth rate, death rate, and migrations. The birth rate is a statistic that measures the number of live births per 1000 people. The death rate is a statistic that measures the number of deaths per 1000 people. Along with birth and death rate, another factor affecting population change is migration. Migration refers to the movement of people from one area to another. People leaving a country are called emigrants and the phenomenon is called emigration. People arriving in a country are called immigrants and the phenomenon is called immigration.

           (a) What can you say about the birth rates of the country? Give evidence.
           <br/>
           (b) What does the shape at the top of the pyramid indicate?
           <br/>
           (c) Which country out of these is most likely to have such a pyramid? A developing country, a developed country, or an underdeveloped country?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A population pyramid is a pictorial way to describe the population composition. An age-sex pyramid gives information about the distribution of different age groups of people based on gender. The shape of the age-sex pyramid of a country is indicative of a lot of information about the country. The size towards the bottom may be used to estimate the birth rate, while the size towards the top to estimate the death rate.
          </p>
<p>
           A population pyramid in which the base is broad and the top part is narrow means that although a large amount of births take place, not all grow up to be adults and old; it means many die before reaching these ages. This indicates a large death rate and Kenya shows such a pyramid. This means a high population growth rate.
           <br/>
           In countries like India, the death rate is decreasing, so the pyramid is broad in the younger age groups, and the size of the pyramid decreases steadily.
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            The given population pyramid has a base narrower than some of its upperparts. This means that the birth rate of the country is not too much.
           </li>
<li>
            As we go to the top, the shape indicates that more people reach old age. This shows a lower death rate as well.
           </li>
<li>
            This is most likely to be the age-sex pyramid of a developed country. The population growth rate seems to be controlled. Moreover, the youth form a major part of the population, so the development levels must be high.
           </li>
</ol>
