           Xyz, 13th June, 20XX, The torrential rain in the past few days flooded our area causing irrecoverable damage to the properties. A relief camp was set up to aid the victims of the flood-affected areas. Everyone made generous contributions in the form of money, clothes, food and other basic requirements. Relief-treaties also emerged as helpful groups. The Chief Minister too announced a definite amount of relief for the victims affected.

           Often, the workers are found working in inhuman conditions, neglecting their health. They are exploited, as they are illiterate and lacking awareness of a hygienic way of life. The authorities must ensure clean and healthy working conditions for these people. It is the responsibility of the government to provide affordable healthcare services to workers and their families. Indian workers should be taught the importance of cleanliness and hygiene. Many non-governmental organizations can play a role in spreading awareness about health and hygiene.
          </p>
<p>
           Workers play a major role in our life. We must understand and appreciate their contribution towards society. Access to basic health facilities is their innate right. As responsible citizens, we should get together to make their lives healthy. However, we should not forget that it is the sweat and blood of these workers which has provided us with enormous comfort while we sit in our well-furnished homes.

           IMPACT OF MEDIA
           <br/>
           Good morning everybody. Today, I Xyz am here to voice my concerns on how Media influences public opinion?
           <br/>
           Media acts as a powerful weapon in democracy. It keeps people abreast with the recent changes and development in the society and the world. They also help people to understand the various developments and build their opinion about the same. With the development of better modes of communications, the influence of media has increased. Consequently, its responsibility of delivering correct information has also increased. If people blindly believe the biased news which the print and electronic media tell us, our democracy will suffer badly. Media has the power to showcase both the facets of a piece of information. It should work towards helping the common man and understand the pros and cons of any issue or event.
          </p>
<p>
           Thus, one can clearly say that it is the responsibility of media and the media personnel to ensure that they direct their efforts towards building a constructive and balanced society as well as a nation.
           <br/>
           Thank you
          </p>

           <br/>
           (c) What image does the poet use in these lines? [2]
           <br/>

           <br/>
           For lives that slyly turn in their cramped holes
           <br/>
           From fog to endless night?
           <br/>
           (i) Who are ‘them’ referred to in the first line? [1]
           <br/>
           (ii) What tempts them? [1]
           <br/>
           (iii) What does the poet say about ‘their’ lives? [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The above given lines are from the poem ‘A thing of Beauty’ by John Keats.
           <br/>
           (b) The tales of mighty men is the thing of beauty mentioned in the given lines.
           <br/>
           (c) The poet used the image of ‘an endless fountain of immortal drink’ to describe the beautiful bounty of the Earth. The Earth, like a fountain, gives us numerous beautiful sights like the sun, the moon, flowers, rivers and greenery.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           (a) The children studying in the school are referred to as “them”.

           (c) According to the poet, those children spent their whole lives like rodents confined in ‘their cramped holes’. The undernourished bodies of those children looked almost like skeletons. Their steel-framed spectacles with repaired glasses made them look like, the broken pieces of a bottle scattered on stones. Since, their entire lives revolved around slums, their future also seemed blotted.

           Question 8.
           <br/>
           Answer any two of the following questions in about 30-40 words : [2 × 2 = 4]
           <br/>

           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Kamala Das is troubled by the thoughts of her ageing mother and tries to console herself by looking outside at the car. The sight is full of youthful whim and vigour. She watches the trees ‘sprinting’ past her speeding car and the children, full of life and activity, running out of their houses to play. Her ashen like mother irks her so much that for a moment she ponders over the past memories to feel solace.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) The exotic moment the author talks about is when everyone keeps quiet and still. The moment would be extraordinarily tranquil, with no hustle-bustle of the frenzied world. Although, it may seem a little strange in the beginning, it would eventually bring us all together. Ultimately, this is the introspection which makes one united with one’s soul.
          </p>
<p>
           (c) Aunt Jennifer spent her life in accordance to the rules laid down by her husband. Her life was overburdened by the demands and duties and it lacked self-expression. She was feeble and it had to face oppression by her husband which depicted the age-old tribulations of women’s lives.

           <br/>
           (d) What tempted Franz to stay away from school?
           <br/>
           (e) Why did the Maharaja ban tiger hunting in the state?
           <br/>
           (f) How was the skunk’s story different from the other stories narrated by Jack?
           <br/>
           (g) Which words of her brother made a deep impression on Bama?

           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Gandhiji believed that the. peasants were under the grip of fear. He felt that taking the Champaran’s case to the court would be useless because actual relief for the peasants would come when they would be free from fear. So, his ultimate motive was to kill the fear in them.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) The peddler was never treated kindly by the world, which is why he was amused by the idea of the world to be a rat trap. He nurtured hard feelings towards the world by comparing it to a giant rat trap.
          </p>

           (c) Mukesh who hailed from the city of Dhaka was different from other bangle makers of Firozabad because he liked to dream, unlike others who followed the family lineage of making bangles. He wanted to be a motor mechanic and drive cars.
          </p>
<p>
           (d) Franz was not prepared for test on participles. The chirping birds and sight of the Prussian soldiers were far more interesting to him than his attending the school. That is why he stayed out of the doors of the school to bask in the nature’s glory.
          </p>
<p>
           (e) The Maharaja wanted to prove that the prediction of the State astrologer was wrong. For that purpose, he restricted the hunting of tigers in all the tiger-rich forests of Pratibandapuram, so that he could hunt them down.
          </p>
<p>
           (f) Usually, the stories told by Jack were taken well by But she was not satisfied and convinced with the ending of the skunk’s Story. She believed that the wizard should have hit back the skunk’s mommy for demanding skunk to get his bad smell back.
          </p>
<p>
           (g) On narrating what happened while returning home, Bama’s elder brother told her, that although, people did not get to decide the family they were born into, they could outwit the indignities inflicted upon them if they were well read and successful. It was by educating themselves that they could attain a feeling of individuality that left a deep impression on her.

           No, Sophie had not met Danny Casey in reality. One day, while drawing Geoff’s attention, Sophie narrated an imaginary story about accidentally meeting Danny Casey at the Royce’s. Geoff, however, refused to believe her. So, she describes Danny Casey’s physical appearance to make her brother believe her story. She told Geoff that she was also willing to get an autograph for little Derek, but she did not have a pen or a paper for the same. Then, Sophie claimed that the two of them talked about clothes at Royce’s. She ended her story by saying that Danny has promised to meet her again.

           OR
           <br/>

A person from St. Mary Mags was called to invigilate and to keep the prisoner incommunicado during the exam. Evans was kept in the heavily guarded Recreational Block. There were two locked doors between his cell and the yard, which boasted of a high wall. All the prison officers were also on high alert. The Governor got a microphone installed in Evans’ cell, while Stephens kept, an eagle eye on Evans. Two prison officers, Mr. Jackson and Mr. Stephens, thoroughly checked his cell for any sign of a possible escape. Even his razor, nail filer and male scissors were taken away.

           Read the following and answer the question that follows: [5]
           <br/>
           The story “Deep Waters” has made you realise that with determination and perseverance one can accomplish the impossible. Write a paragraph in about 100 words words on how a positive attitude and courage will aid you to achieve success in life.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In the story “Deep waters”, the author overcomes his childhood fear of water through determination, perseverance and hard work. Thus, the story sends the message that with positive attitude and strength of will, one can accomplish everything in life. All of us are in the grip of fear. But fear, when conquered with courage, becomes victory which has its own charm. It might appear to be a long and arduous journey, but it will definitely culminate in success. Douglas improved himself and was able to develop into a full-fledged swimmer. It gave him a feeling of victory and achievement in the end.

           YOUTH, THEIR PROBLEMS, AND SOLUTIONS
           <br/>
           Good Morning! I am Sampreet an educationist and today I am going to deliver a speech on the topic youth their problems and solution Aspirations are now high and with this the level of competition and peer pressure among the youth has been increasing with each passing day. The youth is either not yet matured or trained enough to handle so much stress and, therefore, they ultimately get frustrated, easily commit suicide get involve in, road-rage, hatred crimes, drug abuse, looting, rapes etc. At the slightest provocation, they hold out protests and demonstrations. The minimum desired level of tolerance is missing in them. They don’t see any harm in violating the norms and fundamental rights.
          </p>
<p>
           The solution is a doddle one. The youth of today needs our untinted support, it needs to know that, irrespective of the situations they are in they are always loved by their parents, teachers and elders. They need to develop confidence in their capabilities. We need to remove the unnecessary pressure that our education system exerts on the young minds. It needs to be eased and, CCE is a positive step in this direction. Counsellors can help the young generation to understand and solve their problems. More job opportunities need to be created, better recruitment processes are need to be developed, and professional courses that equip them with necessary skills have to be designed.
          </p>
<p>
           The most important thing is to impart value-based education so that they achiveve high self-esteem, tolerance and patience and more importantly the zeal to create a clean and civilised society and to be a good citizen.

           CORRUPTION, ITS CAUSES AND SOLUTIONS
           <br/>
           Good morning, friends! I am Venkat. As a journalist and a responsible citizen of India, it is my duty to shed light and apprise you, that how corruption exists in almost every nook and comer of our country.
          </p>
<p>
           Corruption can be understood as misappropriation of government, public property or money. It is an unlawful and immoral act. Corruption has had a gradual growth in our country. How and why did corruption become so common in our country? India’s colonial past has contributed in flourishing corrupt practices. It is said that corruption cannot survive long in this world. Although, with the increase in scientific technology and advancement of the nation, corruption still remains unbeatable. The corruption also has a relation with scarcity and exists especially because of the vested interests and greed of the people in power.
          </p>
<p>
           It is the spasmodic snare of corruption which springs from all prodigality and dissipation. Whatever the reason may be, corruption is an ill practice that is seen as the major hindrance in the process of economic growth and modernization of the nation. The need for an anti-corruption bill like Jan Lokpal has long been discerned now. But, in a democracy like India, the power of the common man should not be underestimated. Constant vigil and intervention by the civil society is also required to bring positive changes in the country. Punishment must be increased and illegally confiscated wealth must be recovered. As aware citizens and of course as in united whole, we must overcome our flaws and work towards bringing about a corruption free society.

           TEACHER’S DAY CELEBRATIONS
           <br/>
           By Xyz Head boy
           <br/>
           On the occasion of the birth anniversary of our former president, Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, the badge holders of our school had organised a grand celebration on 5th September to honour the teachers of our school, the celebration took place in the assembly hall. It began at around 9:30 a.m. In the morning, senior students greeted the teachers warmly in a traditional way by putting tilak on their forehead and giving them flowers. The senior students were dressed up as and played their role teachers. They counted on the teacher’s efforts by praising them. After honouring all the teachers, the students performed activities like dance, drama, singing and speech. They also organised few games like musical chair, dodge ball, balloon game, etc. to make the day memorable. Teachers were made to dance and sing. In the end, teachers were provided a lavish lunch by the seniors. It was indeed a great celebration.

           <br/>
           A horrible sight of a train accident was witnessed at an unmanned level crossing at Udaipur, near Chittor. A bus was carrying nearly 45 people, happened to cross the railway track when suddenly the train arrived. It happened to collide with one of the bogies of the train and overturned badly. 23 people were seriously injured and they were immediately taken to a nearby hospital by the locals. The bogie was also derailed. The extent of damage caused is not yet estimated. Due to this accident, the train got delayed and the schedule of the other trains of that route was also disturbed. It resulted into a lot of inconvenience to the passengers. Government has set up an enquiry to probe into the matter. A sum of ₹ 50,000 was announced for all those injured.

           Subject: Replacement of the defective sports items
           <br/>
           Sir,
           <br/>
           This is to bring to your kind notice that one month ago, our school placed an order for the following sports items:
           <br/>
           5 Bats, 10 Balls, 3 Footballs, 3 Basketballs, 5 Badminton Racquets.
           <br/>
           On the arrival of the goods, it was found that some of them were defective. The handle of the bats were cracked, the net of one of the badminton racquet was loose and the stitching of the football was not properly done. Therefore, I request you to replace the defective items as soon as possible as the sports week of the school is approaching and the children are required to do the practice. I would be obliged if you kindly understand my problem and arrange for the early delivery.
          </p>
<p>
           Thanking You,
           <br/>
           Yours Sincerely,

           Subject: Unauthorized Parking of Vehicles
           <br/>
           Dear Sir,
           <br/>
           This is to draw your attention towards the problems faced due to unauthorized parking of the vehicles in our area. There is not a single day in our area when the place is without disorder or free from traffic jams. As it is a crowded place, there is inadequate parking space. It creates problems not only to the residents but also to the people who come to meet their relatives or for some other purpose. As it is a busy area, vehicles are parked all over in a haphazard manner. It often results in quarrel among the people who display the lack of civic sense in them also creating noise pollution. It is therefore necessary to take some quick actions and provide the proper parking area to the residents as well as do some arrangements for the visitors too.
           <br/>
           We all hope for an immediate action to get relief from this problem.
          </p>
<p>
           Thanking You,
           <br/>
           Yours Sincerely,
           <br/>
           Rohini/Rohan

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           What were Sophie’s plan for her future? Why would you call her dreams unrealistic? (100-125 words) [5]
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           What benefits did Derry reap from his association with Mr. Lamb?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Sophie was a daydreamer although she belonged to a middle-class family. She was blind to the bitter truth of life. She dreamt of an imaginary life, in which she owned a boutique full of beautiful things. She also dream of becoming an actress as there was a lot of money and fame in the profession. She also wanted to be a fashion designer. It can be said that she wanted to lead a lavish and grand life which was not possible. Her dreams were unrealistic in the sense that ultimately she would have to work in a biscuit factory. She only thought of impractical things. The house in which she lived was also not a very good one and her father used to work hard to earn bread for the family. They entertained themselves by watching the United team’s matches. That’s how she wanted to achieve the impossible dream.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Derry had no association with the outer world till he met Mr. Lamb. His meeting with Mr. Lamb was a turning point in his life. He learned to live a respectful life and also appreciated Mr. Lamb’s attitude and outlook towards people and life. He realized his true worth. Mr. Lamb inspired him to face the world in spite of his disability. Derry’s thinking towards people and life completely changed and he became self-confident. Mr. Lamb successfully infused in him courage and self-determination. He advised him to ignore the comments made by people on his physical impairment and enjoy beauty of life and nature. Derry went back to Mr. Lamb’s garden in spite of his mother’s refusal., Derry understood the importance and true meaning of life and understanding himself better than before. Only due to the association with Mr. Lamb.
