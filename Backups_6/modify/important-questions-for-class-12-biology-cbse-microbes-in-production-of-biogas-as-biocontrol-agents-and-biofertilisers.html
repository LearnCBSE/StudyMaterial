</h2>
<p>
<strong>
            1. Microbes in Production of Biogas
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            (i)
           </strong>
<strong>
            Biogas
           </strong>
           is a mixture of gases (mainly methane) produced by the microbial activity and may be used as a fuel.
           <br/>
           (ii) Certain bacteria, which grow anaerobically on cellulosic material, produce large amount of methane along with C0
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           and H2. These bacteria are called methanogens (one of the common bacterium is Methanobacterium).
           <br/>
<strong>
            (ii) Methanogens
           </strong>
           are commonly found in the anaerobic sludge during sewage treatment and are also present in the rumen (a part of stomach) of cattle.
           <br/>
           (iv) In rumen, methanogens help in the breakdown of cellulose and their excreta called
           <strong>
            gobar
           </strong>
           , is rich in these bacteria. Therefore, cow dung can also be used to produce biogas commonly called as
           <strong>
            gobar gas.
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
            2. Biogas Production
           </strong>
<br/>
           (i) The biogas plant consists of a concrete tank (10-15 feet deep) in which bio-wastes are collected and a slurry of dung is fed.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (ii)
           </strong>
           A floating cover is placed over the slurry, which keeps on rising as the gas is produced in the tank due to microbial activity.
           <br/>
<img alt="important-questions-for-class-12-biology-cbse-microbes-in-production-of-biogas-as-biocontrol-agents-and-biofertilisers-t2-image 1jpg_Page1" class="aligncenter" height="273" loading="lazy" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5734/22996159819_1b2e8b6675_o.jpg" width="327"/>
<br/>
           (iii) The plant has an outlet, which is connected to a pipe to supply biogas to nearby houses.
           <br/>
           (iv) The spent slurry is removed through another outlet and may be used as fertiliser.
           <br/>
           (v) In rural areas, cattle dung is available in plenty. So, biogas plants are built more in these areas to produce biogas for cooking and lighting.
           <br/>
           (vi) This technology of biogas production was developed in India due to the efforts of Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) and Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC).
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            3. Microbes as Biocontrol Agents
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            (i) Biocontrol
           </strong>
           refers to the use of biological methods for controlling the plant diseases and pests.
           <br/>
           (ii) The insecticides and pesticides although useful, are toxic and extremely harmful to humans and animals and have been polluting our environment.
           <br/>
           (iii) Agriculture relies on natural control of pests, i.e. natural predation rather than introduced chemicals.
           <br/>
           (iv) Organic farmers believe in holistic approach that seeks to develop an understanding of the webs of interaction between the myriad of organisms that constitute the field fauna and flora. They holds the view that the eradication of the creatures that are often described as pests is undesirable because without them, the beneficial predatory and parasitic insects would not survive.
           <br/>
           (v) Some approaches for biological farming are:
           <br/>
           (a) Familiarity with various life forms inhabiting the field.
           <br/>
           (b) Understanding of their life cycles, patterns of feeding and preferred habitat of predators and pests.
           <br/>
           (vi) Examples of biocontrol agents are:
           <br/>
           (a) The ladybird and dragonflies are useful to get rid of aphids and mosquitoes, respectively.
           <br/>
           (b) The bacteria, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are used to control butterfly catterpillars.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<ul>
<li>
            Dried spores of Bt are mixed with water and sprayed onto vulnerable plants such as brassicas and fruit trees, where they are eaten by the insect larvae.
           </li>
<li>
            In the gut of the larvae, the toxin is released and the larvae get killed.
           </li>
<li>
            The bacterial disease will kill the catterpillars, but leave other insects unharmed.
           </li>
<li>
            thuringiensis toxin genes are introduced into plants by genetic engineering.Such, plants are resistant to attack by insect pests,e.g. Bt cotton.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           (c) The fungus, Trichoderma is used in the treatment of plant disease.
           <br/>
           These are free-living fungi that are very common in the root ecosystems.
           <br/>
           (d) Baculoviruses are pathogens that attack insects* and other arthropods.
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Majority of baculoviruses used as biocontrol agents belong to the genus Nucleopolyhedrovirus.
           </li>
<li>
            These are species specific, narrow spectrum insecticides.
           </li>
<li>
            They do not harm plants, mammals, birds, fish and other non-target insects.
           </li>
<li>
            Baculoviruses are beneficial in
            <strong>
             Integrated Ppst Management (IPM)
            </strong>
            programme, in which beneficial insects are conserved.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
            4. Microbes as biofertilisers
           </strong>
           enrich the nutrient (nitrogen, phosphorus, etc) quality of the soil.
          </p>
<p>
           (i) The main sources of biofertilisers are bacteria, fungi and cyanobacteria.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (ii) Bacteria as biofertiliser
           </strong>
<br/>
           (a) The nodules on the roots of leguminous plants are formed by the symbiotic association of Rhizobium
           <br/>
           (b) These bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen into organic forms, which is used by the plants as nutrient.
           <br/>
           (c) Other bacteria, such as Azospirillum and Azotobacter, fix atmospheric nitrogen while free-living in the soil. They enrich the nitrogen content of the soil.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (iii) Fungi as biofertilisers
           </strong>
<br/>
           (a) Fungi form symbiotic association with plants (mycorrhiza).
           <br/>
           (b) The fungal symbiont absorbs phosphorus from soil and passes it to the plant.
           <br/>
           (c) Many members of the genus Glomus form mycorrhiza.
           <br/>
           (d) Mycorrhiza shows the following benefits
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<ul>
<li>
            Resistance to root borne pathogens.
           </li>
<li>
            Tolerance to salinity and drought.
           </li>
<li>
            Overall increase in plant growth and development.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
            (iv) Cyanobacteria as biofertilisers
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           (a) Cyanobacteria are autotrophic microbes, many of them fix atmospheric nitrogen.
           <br/>
           (b) Examples of cyanobacteria are Anabaena, Nostoc, Oscillatoria,
           <br/>
           (c) Blue-green algae also add organic matter to the soil and increase its fertility.
           <br/>
           (v) A number of biofertilisers are available commercially in the market. Farmers use these in fields to replenish soil nutrients and to reduce dependence on chemical fertilisers.

<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           The nodules on the roots of leguminous plants are formed by Rhizobium bacteria for their survival. These bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen into organic form, which is used by the plant as nutrients. Since, Rhizobium forms symbiotic association with leguminous plants these are considered as symbiotic bacteria, (l) Rhizobium fixes the atmospheric nitrogen into organic form, i.e. nitrates which can be utilised by the plant as nutrient. So, it is used as biofertilisers.

           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           Bt cotton is created by using some strains of a bacterium known as Bacillus thuringiensis. This bacterium produces protein that kills certain insects such as Lepidopterans, Coleopterans and Bt gene is cloned from this bacteria and had been expressed in cotton plant to provide resistance to the insects without the need for insecticides.
           <br/>
           It is protected against corn borer disease by encoding cry protein with the gene cryIAb. These genes produces Bt toxins which are released in the gut of insects, who feed upon them, thus killing them and protecting the plant from the pests.

           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           (i) A farmer relies on biofertilisers then chemical fertilisers because
           <br/>
           (a) Chemical fertilisers significantly increase the soil pollution and reduce quality of soil, as well as water pollution, when it drains into nearby water bodies, after rain.
           <br/>
           (b) Overuse of chemical fertiliser makes the soil infertile.
           <br/>
           (ii) Anabaena fix atmospheric nitrogen, thus enriching the nitrogen content of the soil, as well as the organic matter.
           <br/>
           In mycorrhiza, the fungal symbiont absorbs phosphorus from the soil and passes it to the plant and provides resistance to root borne diseases. Since, they fulfil the nitrogen and phosphorus requirement they act as biofertilisers.

           Organic farming is a holistic approach that seeks to develop an understanding of the webs of interaction among the myriads of organisms that form the flora and fauna of the field.
           <br/>
           (i) An organic farmer works to create a system, where the insects are not eradicated, but kept at manageable level by a complex system of checks and balance within a living and vibrant ecosystem.
           <br/>
           (ii) Organic farmer states that the eradication of pests is not only possible but also undesirable, because many beneficial predatory and parasitic insects cannot survive without them.
