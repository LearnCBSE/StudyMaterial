           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Why and how did the Mizo Movement for secession gain popular support? [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The movement for secession in the Mizo Hills area gained popular support because some Mizos believed that they were never a part of British India and therefore did not belong to the Indian Union. The movement for secession gained popular support after the Assam government failed to respond adequately to the great famine of 1959 in Mizo hills which affected the dwellers gready. This caused a kind of hatred and disappointment.

           <br/>
           Explain any four reasons for the dominance of the Congress Party in the first three general elections in India. [4 × 1 = 4]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Reasons for the dominance of Congress Party in first three general elections in India :
           <br/>
           (i) The results of the first general election did not surprise anyone as the Indian National Congress was expected to win this election. The Congress party had inherited the legacy of the National Movement. Moreover, it was the only political party to have an organization spread all over the country.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) The Congress Party had’ the most popular and charismatic leader in Nehru ji. The final results of the election did surprise many. The party got 364 of the 489 seats in the first Lok Sabha and finished way ahead of any other challenger party.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) In the’ second and the third general elections, held in 1957 and 1962 respectively, the Congress Party kept its position intact in the Lok Sabha. It won three-fourth of the total seats the other votes were divided among rival parties thus rendering all of them powerless. It was well-distributed among various regions in the country.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) Congress was all inclusive a social and ideological coalition, which contributed to its dominance.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           Major outcomes of the Indian model of mixed economy:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            The State controlled key heavy industries provided the infrastructure. It regulated trade in India.
           </li>
<li>
            Although agriculture was in the private sector, the public sector made some intervention in agriculture. This model laid the foundation of India’s future economic growth.
           </li>
<li>
            Infrastructure for transport and communication was improved substantially.
           </li>
<li>
            Abolition of Zamindari system was the most significant and successful reform.
           </li>
<li>

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Conditions responsible for the growth of Naxalite Movement:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Social and economic injustice prevailing in the society.
           </li>
<li>
            Forced labour.
           </li>
<li>
            Expropriation of resources by outsiders.
           </li>
<li>
            Exploitation by moneylenders.
           </li>
<li>
            The naxalites say it is a fight for improved land rights and more jobs for neglected agricultural labour and poor.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Some suggestions to crush Naxalite Movement:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Government should provide the basic rights to the people of backward areas and Adivasis.
           </li>
<li>
            Forced labour and exploitation by moneylenders must be stopped.
           </li>
<li>
            The Government should follow constitutional norms while dealing with the Naxalites.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Question 17.
           <br/>
           The value of the ruble declined dramatically. The rate of inflation was so high that people lost all their savings. The collective farm system disintegrated leaving people without food security, and the government started to import food. The old trading structure broke down with no alternative in its place. The old system of social welfare was systematically destroyed. The withdrawal of government subsidies pushed large sections of the people into poverty.
           <br/>
           Read the above passage carefully and answer the following questions:
           <br/>
           (i) What is meant by subsidy?
           <br/>
           (ii) How did the disintegration of collective farm system lead to the loss of food security?
           <br/>
           (iii) This passage is associated to which country?
           <br/>
           Why did the government start importing food? [1 + 2 + 2 = 5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (1) Subsidy is the help usually provided by the government to keep the price of a product or service low as compared to the open market price.
           <br/>
           (ii) Collective farming was to be replaced by private farming which meant food grains were to be purchased from the open market. The government had no control over the prices as well as the stock. This created loss of food security.
           <br/>
           (iii) (1) This passage is associated with Russia.
           <br/>
           (2) The government started importing food due to scarcity of food grains and privatization of agriculture.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 18.
           <br/>
           Globalization does not always reduce state capacity. The primacy of the state continues to be the unchallenged basis of the political community. The old jealousies and rivalries between countries have not ceased to matter in world politics. The state continues to discharge its essential functions (law and order, national security) and consciously withdraws from certain domains from which it wishes to. State continue to be important.
           <br/>
           Indeed, in some respects state capacity has received a boost as a consequence of globalization, with enhanced technologies available at the disposal of the state to collect information about its citizens.
           <br/>
           Read the passage given above carefully and answer the following questions :
           <br/>
           (i) What are the two most essential functions of the state?
           <br/>
           (ii) How do enhanced technologies enable the state to rule better?
           <br/>
           (iii) Justify with the help of an example that
           <br/>
           globalization gives a boost to the state capacity. [1 + 2 + 2 = 5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) (1) To defend and secure the boundaries of the State to maintain national security.
           <br/>
           (2) To provide justice and maintain law and order.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) (1) On the basis of enhanced technologies, the state can keep proper check on its citizens grievance and other problems.
           <br/>
           (2) Enhanced technologies enable the State to collect important information about its citizens.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Globalisation helps the states to connect better, administrate better through the help of enhanced technologies available for the state to use. This helps it to perform better.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 19.
           <br/>
           Two developments strained this relationship. China annexed Tibet in 1950 and thus removed a historical buffer between the two countries. Initially, the Government of India did not oppose this openly. But as more information came in about the suppression of Tibetan culture, the Indian Government grew uneasy. The Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, sought and obtained political asylum in India in 1959. China alleged that the Government of India was allowing anti-China activities to take place within India.
           <br/>
           Read the above passage carefully and answer the following questions :
           <br/>
           (i) What is meant by ‘historical buffers?
           <br/>
           (ii) Why didn’t the Government of India oppose the annexation of Tibet by China?
           <br/>
           (iii) How far was it justified on the part of India to grant political asylum to the Dalai Lama and thousands of Tibetan refugees? [1 + 2 + 2 = 5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) ‘Historical buffer’ means the country or area that lies between two large and powerful countries and reduces the risk of war between them.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) India was a newly independent country and did not want to get involved with war against China unnecessarily. It was an internal matter of China, so India did not want to spoil its relation with China. But on a later stage, India realized its mistake.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) In 1958, there was an armed uprising in Tibet against China’s occupation. However, more information came in about the suppression of Tibetan culture by the Chinese forces. Consequently, the Dalai Lama sought and got political asylum in India in 1959, along with thousands of Tibetan refugees.
           <br/>
           Thus it was fully justified to help them on humanitarian grounds as well as a good neighbour country.

            Internal weakness of Soviet political and economical institutions.
           </li>
<li>
            Soviet Union used much of its resources in maintaining nuclear and military arsenals. The Cherynobyl disaster was one of the major effect of neglegnce. Thus, a large amount was spent to avoid such accident.
           </li>
<li>
            The Communist party that had ruled the Soviet Union for over 70 years was not accountable to the people.
           </li>
<li>
            Ordinary people were alienated by slow and stifling administration, rampant corruption, the inability of the system to correct mistake it had made, the unwillingness to allow more openness in government and the centralization of authority in a vast land.
           </li>
<li>
            The party bureaucrats gained more privileges than ordinary citizens.
           </li>

           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           OR
           <br/>

            The end of the Second World War was also considered to be the beginning of the Cold War. The war came to an end when the US dropped two atom bombs on the Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This action of the US forced Japan to surrender.
           </li>
<li>
            Virtually, the US action was akin to one upmanship. It was intended to check the USSR from having military and political gains in Asia and other parts of the world.

<li>
            The end of the Second World War created new power equations along with new and changed areas of conflicts. The fire of the Second World War extinguished but left some cinders.
           </li>
<li>
            The US and the USSR emerged as two superpowers who were rivals to each other. Both sides had capacity to retaliate against an attack and cause lots of destruction, but neither could afford to begin war.
           </li>
<li>
            Thus, the rivalry between the two superpowers remained a ‘cold’ and not hot or shooting war. Both sides followed the logic of deterrence and began to make military blocs. The smaller states were forced to link to the superpowers.

           Question 23.
           <br/>
           “Resistance is the only option available to overcome the hegemony.” Justify the statement by comparing it to other anti-hegemony strategies. [6]

           Assess the role of ASEAN as an economic association.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Hegemony can be overcome by the following the given strategies :
           <br/>
           (i) Band wagon strategy
           <br/>
           (ii) Hide strategy
           <br/>
           (i) Band wagon strategy: Some people think that it is strategically more prudent to take advantage of the opportunities provided by the hegemony. For instance, raising economic growth rates requires increased trade, technological transfers and investment, which are best acquired by working with rather than against the hegemony. Instead of engaging in activities opposed to the hegemonic power it may be better to extract benefits. This is called band wagon strategy.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Hide strategy: Another strategy open to states is to hide. This implies stay away from the dominant power as far as possible. However this wouldn’t seem to be viable for the big countries. This strategy can be an attractive policy for small states but it is hard to imagine for mega-states like China, India, Russia and European Union being able to hide for a long time from the influence of US. Resistance seems an easier option than these two because it can be applied for a long time. These strategies together, will definitely be successful in resisting the hegemony.

          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            The security challenges facing the newly independent countries of Asia and Africa were certainly different from the challenges in Europe in two ways. These new countries faced the prospect of military conflict with neighbouring countries.
           </li>
<li>
            These countries also had to worry about internal-military conflict. These countries faced threats not only from outside their boundaries or from their neighbours, but also from within.

<li>
            Several newly independent countries came to fear their neighbours even more than they feared the US or the USSR or the former colonial powers. They had disputes and differences over borders and territories or control over people or all of these simultaneously.
           </li>
<li>
            Internally the new states were anxious and troubled about threats from separatist movements which desired to make independent countries.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           Major changes country witnessed at the time of Fourth General Elections :
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Two Prime Ministers died in quick succession and the new Prime Minister, who was being seen as a political noble, had been in office for less than a year.
           </li>
<li>
            The period was fraught with grave economic crises.
           </li>
<li>
            Widespread drought and decline in agricultural production.
           </li>
<li>
            Serious food shortage.
           </li>
<li>
            Depletion of foreign exchange reserves.
           </li>
<li>
            Drop in industrial production and exports.

<li>
            Combined with sharp rise in military expenditures and diversion of resources from planning and economic development.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           OR
           <br/>
           Due to the following reasons the emergency became controversial:
           <br/>
           (i) The Constitution simply mentioned internal disturbance as the reason for declaring emergency. Before 1975 emergency was never proclaimed on this ground.
           <br/>
           There was no specification regarding which acts could be considered “internal disturbances”.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) People had the right to politically protest against the government. Bihar and Gujarat agitation were mostly peaceful and non-violent. Those who were arrqsted were never tried for any anti-national activity.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) The Home Ministry, which is entrusted with the responsibility of monitoring the internal situation of the country, also did not express any concern about the law and order situation in the country.
           <br/>
           Hence, most people did not find any concrete reasons for the emergency to be proclaimed. This was why, it was considered controversial.

           Although the British empire in India came to an end in 1947, Portugal refused to withdraw from the territories of Goa, Diu and Daman which were under its colonial rule since the sixteenth century. During their long rule, the Portuguese suppressed the people of Goa, denied them civil rights, and carried out forced religious conversions. After India’s Independence, the Indian government tried very patiently to persuade the Portuguese government to withdraw. There was also a strong popular movement within Goa for freedom. They were strengthened by socialist satyagrahis from Maharashtra. Finally, in December 1961, the Government of India sent the army which this liberated territory after barely two days of action. Goa, Diu and Daman became Union Territories.
          </p>
<p>
           Another complication arose soon. Led by the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) one section desired that Goa, as a Marathi speaking area should merge with Maharashtra. However, many Goans were keen to retain a separate Goan identity and culture, particularly the Konkani language. They were led by the United Goan Party (UGP). In January 1967, the Central Government held a special ‘opinion poll’ in Goa asking people to decide if they wanted to be part of Maharashtra or remain separate. This was the only time in independent India that a referendum-like procedure was used to ascertain people’s wishes on a subject. The majority voted in favour of remaining outside of Maharashtra. Thus, Goa continued as a Union Territory. Finally, in 1987, Goa became a State of the Indian Union.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Alliance building as a component of traditional security policy is a coalition of states that coordinates their actions to deter or defend against military attack. Most alliances are formalised in written treaties and are based on a fairly clear identification of who constitutes the threat. Countries make alliances to exchange their effective power , relative to another alliance.
           <br/>
           Its advantages are :
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            It increases their effective power relative to another country or alliance.
           </li>
<li>
            Alliances are based on national interests and can change when national interests change.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The concept of common propern’ resource means common property for a group. The underlying norm is that members of the group have both rights and duties with respect to the nature, levels of use and the maintenance of a given resource. For example, the management of sacred groves on state-owned forest land along the forest belt of South India. The institutional arrangement for the actual management of the sacred groves on state-owned forest land appropriately fits the description of a common property regime.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) As a social coalition: The Congress began as a party dominated by the English speaking, upper caste, upper middle-class and urban elite. But with every civil disobedience movement it launched, its social base widened. It brought together diverse groups, whose interests were often contradictory. Peasants and industrialists, urban dwellers and villagers, workers and owners, middle, lower and upper classes and castes, all found space in the Congress.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) As an ideological coalition: It accommodated the revolutionary and pacifist, conservative and radical, extremist and moderate and the right, left and all shades of the centre. The Congress was a ‘platform’ for numerous groups, interests and even political parties to take part in the national movement. In pre-Independence days, many organizations and parties with their own constitution and organizational structures were allowed to exist within the Congress.

           OR
           <br/>
           Non-traditional notions of security goes beyond military threats. It includes a wide range of threats and dangers affecting the conditions of human . existence. They begin by questioning the traditional referent of security. In doing so, they also question the other three elements of security — what is being secured, from what kind of threats and the approach to security.
          </p>
<p>
           The narrow concept of human security focuses on violent threats of individuals.

           The broad concept of human security on the other hand, advocates the ‘broad’ concept of human security and argues that the threat agenda should include hunger, disease and natural disasters because they kill far more people than war, genocide and terrorism combined.

           OR
           <br/>
           What is the social and political composition of Jammu and Kashmir ? Describe the roots of ‘Kashmir Issue’ which compelled the Indian Government to maintain autonomy in this state.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Advantages of popular movements :
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            They represented new social groups whose economic and social grievances were not redressed in the realm of electoral politics. They ensured effective representation of diverse groups and their demands.
           </li>
<li>
            They reduced the possibility of deep social conflict and disaffection of these groups from democracy.
           </li>
<li>
            Popular movement suggested new forms- of active participation and thus broadened the idea of participation in Indian democracy.
           </li>
<li>
            They involve a gradual process of coming together of people with similar problems, similar demands and similar expectations.
           </li>
<li>
            They make people aware of their rights and the expectations that they can have from democratic institutions.
           </li>
<li>
            They have been involved in educative tasks for a long time and have thus contributed to expansion of democracy rather than causing disruptions.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           OR
           <br/>
           Jammu and Kashmir comprises three social and political regions: Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh. The heart of the Kashmir region is the Kashmir valley; the people are Kashmiri speaking and mostly Muslim with a small Kashmiri speaking Hindu minority. Jammu region is a mix of foothills and plains, of Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs and speakers of various languages. The Ladakh region is mountainous, has very little population which is equally divided between Buddhists and Muslims.
           <br/>
           Roots of Kashmir Issue :
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            When Maharaja of Kashmir signed the Instrument of Accession with Government of India, it was also agreed upon that once the situation got normalised, the views of the people of J &amp; K would be ascertained about their future.
           </li>
<li>
            India agreed to maintain the autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir.
           </li>
<li>
            Since then the politics of J &amp; K always remained controversial and conflict ridden both for external and internal reasons. Externally, Pakistan has always claimed that Kashmir valley should be part of Pakistan.
           </li>
<li>
            There is a dispute among Kashmiri citizens about the status of the state within the Indian Union.
           </li>
<li>
            Article 370 and 371 give special status to J &amp; K; the state has its own constitution. Not all provisions are applicable to J &amp; K. Laws passed by the Parliament apply to J &amp; K only if the state agrees. So, the problem persists.

           <br/>
           How do per capita income and population growth affect the economic disparity in the world ? Suggest any two ways to reduce economic disparity between the poor and the rich at the global level. [2 + 2 = 4]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Per Capita income and population growth:
           <br/>
           (i) Per Capita income and population growth affect in the economic disparity in the world. As we know that high per capita income and low population growth make rich countries or rich social groups, richer.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) On the other hand, per capita low income and high population growth reinforce each other to make poor countries and poor groups, poorer.
          </p>
<p>
           Two ways to reduce Economic Disparity :
           <br/>
           (i) To reduce economic disparity between the poor and the rich at the global level, countries affected by this economic disparity will have to slow down population growth and raise incomes.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Countries hit by the economic disparity will have to use their available resources judiciously. They will have to strengthen their political, economic, social, cultural and demographic structures as to abridge the gap of economic disparity.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Difference between the economic ideologies of the Congress Party and the Swatantra Party:
          </p>

           Question 24.
           <br/>
           Describe the composition of U.N. Security Council. What is the major difference in the privileges given to its permanent and non¬permanent members ? [6]
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Describe any three new sources of threat to security giving examples for each. [6]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Security Council is an important organ of the UN which is mainly responsible for ensuring peace in the world. The Security Council of 15 members of which 5 are permanent members and 10 are elected by the General Assembly after every two years. The non-permanent members are not eligible for immediate re-election. Each member of Security Council has one vote. The approval of all the permanent members is necessary on important matters. In the event of a threat to peace or occurrence of war between two or more countries, the Security Council has the power to take appropriate measures to restore peace and security.
          </p>
<p>
           U.N. Security Council is an important organ of United Nations. It has fifteen members — five permanent and ten elected by the General Assembly for two year terms. Difference in the privileges between permanent and non-permanent members :
           <br/>
           (i) The main privileges of the permanent members are permanency and the veto power, which can neglect any resolution of the Security Council.
           <br/>
           (ii) The non-permanent members serye for only two years at a time. A country cannot be re-elected immediately after completing their term. They do not have Veto power.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           New source of threat are :
           <br/>
           (i) Terrorism: It refers to political violence f that targets civilians indiscriminately. International terrorism involves the citizens or territory of more than our country. They use civilians as a weapon against national government to change a political context or condition they do not like.
           <br/>
           Example: Plane hijacking, planting bombs at crowded places etc.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Human rights: These are in the form of political, economical, social rights and the rights of colonized people or ethnic and indigenous minorities.’ Example : Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, Indonesian military’s killing of people in East Timor.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Health epidemics: Due to migration, business, tourism etc. epidemics like HIV— AIDS, bird flu, and SARS have rapidly spread across countries. By 2003, an estimated 4 crore people were infected with HIV—AIDS worldwide. Treatment of these epidemics have proved to be a major factor in driving the region backward into deeper poverty.

<p>
           Question 27.
           <br/>
           Describe the journey of the movement for Right to Information which ultimately culminated into an Act i.e. RTI Act, 2005. [6]
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Describe the internal and external disputes responsible for making the politics of Jammu and Kashmir continuously controversial. [6]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Movement for Right to Information Act, 2005:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            The movement started in 1990 by Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan (MKSS) in Rajasthan who adopted the initiative in asking for records of famine relief work along with accounts of labourers.
           </li>
<li>
            The villagers asserted their right to information.
           </li>
<li>
            The movement had a small success when they could force an amendment in the Rajasthan Panchayati Raj Act.
           </li>
<li>
            In 1966, MKSS formed National Council for People’s Right to Information in Delhi to raise RTI to the status of National Campaign.
           </li>
<li>
            In 2002, a weak Freedom of Information Act was legislated but never came into force.
           </li>
<li>
            In 2004, RTI Bill was tabled and received Presidential assent in June 2005.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           OR
           <br/>
           The politics of Jammu and Kashmir always remained controversial and conflict ridden both for external and internal reasons. Externally, Pakistan has always claimed that Kashmir valley should be the part of Pakistan. Pakistan sponsored a tribal invasion of the State in 1947, as a consequence of which one part of the State came under Pakastani control. India claims that this area is under illegal occupation. Pakistan describes this area as Azad Kashmir’. Ever since 1947, Kashmir has remained a major issue of conflict between India and Pakistan.
          </p>
<p>
           Internally, there is a dispute about the status of Kashmir within the Indian union. Kashmir was given a special status by Article 370 and 371 last year in Indian Constitution at work. Article 370 gives greater autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir compared to other States of India. The state has its own Constitution. All provisions of the Indian Constitution are not applicable to the state. Laws passed by the Parliament apply to J &amp; K only if the State agrees.
          </p>
<p>
           This special status has provoked two opposite reactions. There is a section of people outside of J &amp; K that believes that the special status of the state conferred by Article 370 does not allow full integration of the State with India.
          </p>
<p>
           Another section, mostly Kashmiris, believe that the autonomy conferred by Article 370 is not enough. A section of Kashmiris has expressed at least three major grievances. First, the promise that accession would be referred to the people of the state after the situation created by tribal invasion was normalised, has not been fulfilled. This has generated the demand for a ‘Plebiscite’. Secondly, there is a feeling that the special federal status guaranteed by Article 370, has been eroded in practice. This has led to the demand for restoration of autonomy or ‘Greater State Autonomy’. Thirdly, it is felt that democracy which is practiced in the rest of India has not been similarly institutionalized in the state of Jammu and Kashmir.
