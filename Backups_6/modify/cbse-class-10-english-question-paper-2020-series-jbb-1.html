           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below carefully: 10
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           1. As the family finally sets off from home after many arguments there is a moment of lull as the car takes off. “Alright, so where are we going for dinner now?” asks the one at the driving wheel. What follows is a chaos as multiple voices make as many suggestions.
          </p>
<p>
           2. By the time order is restored and a decision is arrived at, tempers have risen, feelings injured and there is at least one person grumbling.
          </p>
<p>
           3. Twenty years ago, you would step out of home, decision of meal and venue already made with no arguments or opposition and everybody looked forward to the meal with equal enthusiasm. The decision was made by the head of the family and the others fell in line. Today every member of the family has a say in every decision which also promotes a sense of togetherness and bonding.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           4. We empower our kids to take their own decisions from a very early age. We ask them the cuisine they prefer, the movie they want to see, the holiday they wish to go on and the subjects they wish to study.
          </p>
<p>
           5. It’s a closely connected world out there where children consult and guide each other. A parent’s well-meaning advice can sound like nothing more than unnecessary preaching. How then do we reach our children through all the conflicting views and make the voice of reason be heard? Children today question choices and prefer to go with the flow.
          </p>
<p>
           6. What then is the best path to take? I would say the most important thing one can do is to listen. Listen to your children and their silences. Ensure that you keep some time aside for them, insist that they share their stories with you. Step into their world. It is not as complicated as it sounds; just a daily half an hour of the ‘quality time’ would do the trick.
          </p>
<p>
           1.1 On the basis of your reading of the above passage, answer the following questions in 30 – 40 words each. 2 × 4 = 8
           <br/>
           (a) Write one advantage and one disadvantage of allowing every family member to be part of the decision making process.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           One advantage of allowing every family member to be the part of the decision making process is that it promotes a sense of togetherness and bonding with the family. The disadvantage is because of multiple choices which result in rising tempers, injured feelings and at least one person ends up grumbling.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) In today’s world, what are parents asking their kids?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Parents empower their children to take their own decisions. They are asking them what cuisine they prefer, which movie they want to see, what kind of a holiday they wish to go on and which subjects they want to study.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           (c) Which two pieces of advice does the writer give to the parents?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The writer’s advice to parents is that they should most importantly listen to their children and try to understand their silences. The parents should insist that their children share their stories with them and ensure that they spend at least daily half an hour of ‘quality time’ with them.
          </p>
<p>
           (d) The passage supports the parents. How far do you agree with the author’s views? Support your view with a reason.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The author’s point of view is very apt and relevant in today’s times wherein many parents are unable to spend ‘quality time’ with their children due to their hectic work schedules. The parents need to spend ‘at least half an hour’ with their children and ensure that they share their stories with them.
          </p>
<p>

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below:
           <br/>
           Global weather is warming leading to Arctic meltdown. This is primarily a result of the greenhouse effect caused by too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which acts as a blanket, trapping heat and warming the plant. Burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas for energy cutting down and burning forests to create pastures and plantations leads to carbon accumulation. Refrigeration and air conditioning and certain agricultural practices also aggravate the problem by releasing additional potent global warming gases such as methane and nitrous oxide. Over the last century, global average temperature has increased by more than 1.0° F.
           <br/>

<br/>
           A warming would also have the potential to change rainfall and snow patterns, increase droughts and severs storms, reduce lake ice cover, melt glaciers, increase sea levels and change plant and animal behaviour. The impact of global warming on our planet is extremely serious and if this problem is not talked on an urgent basis it will lead to melting of polar ice caps leading to an increase in sea level drowning coastlines and slowly submerging continents. Our generation needs to give a healing touch to the earth which we have ourselves made sick.
          </p>

<p>
           Sir
           <br/>
           Through the medium of this letter I would like to draw your attention to the menace of street dogs in our new Jai Bharat Dwarka locality. These dogs are uncontrollable. They attack every passerby growling at them and throwing food at them. These dogs seem very dangerous especially for the small children playing in the society grounds. Last week they gave a dog-bite to a child of 5 years who was saved with great difficulty. The residents of our society have given a written complaint to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi but no steps have been taken so far to control and catch these dogs. I hope your newspaper will bring the attention of the concerned authorities along with the general public towards this matter so that appropriate steps can be taken to erase this menace.
          </p>

           [A] The level of pollution on earth is increasing at an alarming rate the picture warns us by depicting that polluted scenario and it will not be long before we actually have to used oxygen masks to breathe in our own planet. Man has constantly used his inventive genius to make spectacular breakthroughs in technology. Our progress has seriously disturbed the ecological balance, paving the way for the breakdown of our life-support systems. Taking our environment for granted will make it difficult for us to inhabit our own planet and if we do not mend our ways it might be too late to repair the damage that we ourselves are causing to our planet.

           What do you think about Anne’s talent for writing essays which she wrote convincingly, when punished by the teacher?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Mijbil befriended the narrator on the second night itself, came to his bed and remained asleep in the crook of his knees. He was intelligent and quickly learnt to turn the taps on. Two days after Mijbil came to the writer’s house, he entered the bathroom and before the writer could get in Mijbil was up on the end of the bathtub, fumbling at the taps with his paws. Much to the writer’s amazement he managed to turn the tap in less than a minute and after a moment he achieved the full flow of water. In the bathtub, he went wild with joy in the water, plunging and rolling in it and shooting up and down. The narrator’s love for Mijbil made him follow the narrator even without a lead. He spent most of his time in play and would often lie on his back and juggle with small objects between his paws.
           <br/>
           Or,
           <br/>
           Mr. Keesing, Anne’s Maths teacher, was annoyed with her because she talked too much. After several warnings, he assigned her extra homework to write an essay on the subject ‘Chatterbox’. Anne wrote the essay very convincingly and came up with credible arguments to prove the necessity of talking. She had no hesitation in admitting that talking was a student’s trait and she would do her best to keep herself under control. But she would not be able to cure her habit as this was a trait she had inherited from her mother. Even Mr. Keesing laughed at her arguments. Later, she read out the poem about the baby ducklings who were bitten to death by their father because they quacked too much.

           Give a brief character sketch of Ebright’s mother.

           How did the people on the earth help the Martian people? How did this effort help the people on both the planets?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Ebright’s mother was a very sincere lady who worked very hard to educate and guide her son. She encouraged his interest in learning when he was a child. She took him on trips, bought him telescopes, microscopes, cameras, mounting materials and other such equipment. Almost every evening she found work for him by which he would learn things since Ebright was very keen to learn. After Ebright’s father died, he became the centre of his mother’s life and she, in turn, did all she could to enhance his learning prowess by many methods which went on to make him a renowned scientist. She also got Ebright a children’s book called “The Travels of Monarch X”, which opened the world of science to him.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           The people on Earth helped the Martian people by teaching them the difference between sandwiches and books. They taught the Martians how to read and established a model library in their capital city Marsopolis. Earlier, the Martians did not know what books were. Think-Tank thinks they are sandwiches, the main food of Earth diet. He even orders Omega to eat it who in turn lets Lieutenant Iota eat it as he had not had his breakfast. Iota finds it as a great honour to be the first Martian to eat a sandwich. In fact an old book of nursery rhymes had saved the world from a Martian invasion. Then in the twenty-first century the Earthlings resumed contact with Mars and even became friendly with the Martians.

<p>
           The machine makes a weird sound and stops of its own accord all of a sudden. Its functional switch too does not work properly. I am sure some manufacturing defect is hampering its working. I hereby request you to have this faulty washing machine replaced immediately instead of getting it repaired. The machine comes with a 2-years warranty with full replacement in case of any technical fault within the first six months.
          </p>
<p>
           Keeping in mind the goodwill and the good reputation that your showroom has earned, I expect prompt action from your end. I am enclosing a photocopy of the invoice and the warranty card for your reference.

           Through the medium of the columns of your esteemed newspaper I would like to bring to the attention of the concerned authorities a problem that the residents of J-Block, Rajouri Garden are facing due to a damaged water pipe.
          </p>
<p>
           The water pipe that supplies drinking water to our area is damaged and there has been no water supply for the last two days. Due to this the residents are facing numerous difficulties. The authorities too have turned a deaf ear to our complaints. It is our request to them to undertake repair work of the pipe immediately. Until the time the water pipe is repaired, we residents also request the supply of drinking water through tankers.
          </p>
<p>
           I sincerely, hope after reading my grievance letter in your esteemed newspaper the concerned authorities will take notice of our woes and take immediate steps to rectify the damaged water pipe.

           Why is Mrs. Pumphrey responsible for Tricki’s condition? 2
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Though Mrs. Pumphrey was Tricki’s loving and caring mistress but her love and care did more harm than good to Tricki. She pampered him incessantly and overfed him to such an extent that made Tricki fat like a bloated sausage, not realising that her over-caring attitude was actually making him sick. It was due to Mrs. Pumphrey’s pampering and overfeeding him, that Tricki fell seriously ill.

           <br/>
           Why was Nelson Mandela overwhelmed with a sense of history? How did he succeed in ending the apartheid regime in South Africa? 8
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Describe the journey of Sidhartha Gautama becoming the Buddha. 8
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Nelson Mandela was overwhelmed with a sense of history on the day of the inauguration. He thought of the past when in the first decade of the twentieth century, a few years after the bitter Anglo-Boer War and before his own birth, the white-skinned people of South Africa patched up their differences and created a system of racial domination against the dark-skinned people of their own land. The structure they created was one of the harshest and most inhumane the world had ever known. Then, in the last decade of the twentieth century and Mandela’s own eighth decade on earth, the cruel apartheid regime had been overturned forever through the unimaginable sacrifices of thousands of people in Mandela’s land whose suffering and courage can never be counted or repaid.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Siddhartha Gautama had been shielded from the sufferings of the world till the age of about twenty-five. Thereafter, while he was out on a hunting trip that he chanced upon a sick man, then an aged man, then a funeral procession and finally a monk begging for alms. These sights moved him so much that he at once went out into the world to seek enlightenment concerning the sorrows he had witnessed. He wandered for seven years and finally sat down under a peepal tree, where he vowed to stay till he gained enlightenment. Enlightened after seven days he renamed the tree as the Bodhi tree (tree of wisdom) and began to teach and share his new understandings. At that point he came to be known as the Buddha.

           Question 11.
           <br/>
           Attempt the following question in 100 – 150 words.
           <br/>
           How did education change Bholi’s personality? 8
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           How did Griffin’s invisibility come to his help whenever he found himself in trouble? 8
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           If one has the will and the inclination, nothing is impossible and if this willingness is backed by love and encouragement, the most far-fetched and impossible goals can also be achieved. This is aptly proved in the story of Bholi who gets a completely new personality and identity all because of the sincere and genuine efforts of her teacher. Her teacher’s loving words touched her heart and instilled in her the confidence to live up to her teacher’s expectations because she did not want to let down such a kind lady. Her teacher plays a very important role in her life by giving her education and the courage to stand up for her own self-respect. Her teacher makes her confident enough to fight for her own right. When she comes off age her parents decide to marry her to a man twice her age. When the greedy groom demanded a hefty dowry she rebelled because of her education and did not let herself be taken for granted by a mean, greedy and contemptible man like Bishamber. She saved her father from a huge expense in this manner.

           After the death of her son, Kisa Gotami realised that death is common to all. There is no way by which those who have been born can avoid dying. All creatures have to fall into the power of death. The world is suffering with death and decay, therefore the wise do not grieve, knowing the terms of the world. No one will obtain peace of mind from crying or being sad. On the contrary his pain will be greater and his body will suffer. He, who is able to overcome his sorrow and become composed will obtain peace of mind and be blessed.

           Griffin did not miss an opportunity to misuse his invisibility whenever he found himself in trouble. Being a lawless person he misused his invisibility to trouble others. His landlord disliked him and tried to eject him. In revenge Griffin set fire to the house and then he became invisible so that he could get away. He slipped into a London Store to clothe and feed himself and helped himself to the cold meat and coffee in the grocery section. He used his invisibility to steal money from the clergyman’s study. Then to evade arrest by the village constable Jaffers, Griffin again became invisible, knocked down the constable who became unconscious and managed to escape easily.

          </p>
<p>
           Sir
           <br/>
           Through the medium of the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I would like to advise people to follow rules while driving vehicles.
          </p>
<p>
           It is rather unfortunate to see people becoming more and more intolerant of others on the road and driving their vehicles recklessly which sometimes leads to road rage. Moreover, these reckless and careless drivers endanger the lives of so many people. These people flout the traffic rules and do not adhere to speed limits.
          </p>
<p>
           It is surprising that these dangerous drivers do not realize the importance of following rules while driving their vehicles. They need to be dealt with most sternly and the Traffic Police needs to take stringent action against them. Heavy fines need to be levied against such defaulters who overspeed and do not follow the traffic rules.
          </p>
<p>
           I hope you will publish my letter in your newspaper so that the imperative need to follow rules while driving vehicles is reiterated.
          </p>

           Question 9.

           Why does Mrs. Hall find the scientist (the new guest) eccentric? 2
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Griffin had booked two rooms at Mrs. Hall’s inn in the village of Iping. She made every effort to be friendly with him but Griffin had no desire to talk. He told Mrs. Hall that his reason for coming to Iping was his desire for solitude and he did not wish to be disturbed in his work. Thereafter, Mrs. Hall was sure that her guest was an eccentric scientist.

           Question 10.

           Neighbours must have a cordial relationship which Lomov and Natalya do not have. Describe the first fight between them. 8

           Or
           <br/>
           What message does Adrienne Rich want to convey through the poem, ‘The Trees’? 8
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Lomov and Natalya are next-door neighbours. Lomov comes to Natalya’s place to propose to her. But in their very first meeting itself we get to see a glimpse of things that are to be expected in their married life. In spite of being rich they quarrel over a small piece of land, ‘Oxen Meadows’. Lomov says his aunt’s grandmother gave the free use of these Meadows to the peasants of Natalya’s father’s grandfather in return for which they were to make bricks for her. Natalya does not agree with Lomov and offers to make a present of it to Lomov who outrightly rejects her suggestion. The would-be couple are rather materialistic and do not possess the qualities of tolerance and compassion for the other person’s feelings.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           In this poem Adrienne Rich has personified nature. Man has confined nature within four walls. He has uprooted the trees and kept them indoors. But nature cannot be controlled by humans for long. The trees struggle to break free from their barriers. They break all the bondages that confine them and move towards their natural habitat, the forest. Only there can they grow freely and naturally. Moreover forest is the natural habitat of trees, birds and insects. In the absence of trees in forests, the ecological balance will be disturbed. Human civilization has led to incessant deforerstation as a result of which forests have become empty. The birds and insects have lost their abode. However, the poet is hopeful that the forests will be ‘full of trees’ again.

           Question 11.
           <br/>
           Attempt the following question in 100 – 150 words.
           <br/>
           Mrs. Pumphrey, the overindulgent and caring mistress of Tricki, pampers her pet dog like a spoiled child. Comment. 8
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           What were Horace Danby’s plans for his iatest robbery? 8
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Tricki, a small dog, was pampered by his rich mistress. He was overfed by her to such an extent that he became hugely fat, like a bloated sausage. Since he was never refused food, he became greedy and could tackle a meal at any hour of the day and night. Inspite of repeated warnings of Dr. Herriot, Mrs. Pumphrey could not help pampering him. Finally, Tricki became very ill. He would eat nothing, even refused his favourite dishes and had bouts of vomiting. He spent all his time lying on a rug, panting. It was only after Dr. Herriot got him out of Mrs. Pumphrey’s house and kept him away from his overpampering mistress that the little dog recovered and was transformed into a lithe, hardmuscled animal.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Horace Danby was sure that his latest robbery was going to be as successful as all the others. He had been studying the house at Shotover Grange for two weeks. He had looked at its rooms, its electric wiring, its path and its garden. On the afternoon, that he had planned his robbery, the two servants who remained in the Grange while the family was in London, had gone to the movies. Horace had seen them leaving and he felt happy with the favourable sequence of events, despite the little tickle of hay fever in his nose. He came out from behind the garden wall, with his tools carefully packed in a bag on his back knowing that there were around fifteen thousand pounds’ worth of jewels in the Grange safe.
