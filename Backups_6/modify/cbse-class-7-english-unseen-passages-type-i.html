<strong>
            I had a Dove

<br/>
           I had a dove and the sweet dove died
           <br/>
           And I thought it died of grieving :
           <br/>
           O, what could it grieve for ? Its feet were tied
           <br/>
           With a silken thread of my own hand’s weaving ;
           <br/>
           Sweet little red feet! why should you die—
           <br/>
           Why should you leave me, sweet bird ! why ?
           <br/>
           You liv’d glone on the forest-tree,
           <br/>
           Why, pretty thing ! would you not live with me ?
           <br/>
           I kissed you oft and gave you white peas ;
           <br/>
           Why not live sweetly, as in the green trees ?

           Questions

           1. What did the crow do ?
           <br/>

           3. What do the last two lines mean ?
           <br/>
           4. What is the message of the poem ?
           <br/>
           Answers:
           <br/>
           1. The poet was under a hemlock tree. A crow shook one of the tree’s branches. This made some of the dry snow on the tree fall on the poet.
           <br/>
           2. The crow’s action changed the poet’s mood. He began to feel better.
           <br/>
           3. The last two lines mean that it had been a bad and regretful day for the poet. The only pleasant incident was the one when the crow caused some snow to fall on him.
           <br/>
           4. The message of the poem is that Nature has a soothing influence on a person. It is capable of changing a sorrowful person into a happy human being.

            Passage 3
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
            Piping Down the Valleys Wild
           </strong>
<br/>
           Piping down the valleys wild,
           <br/>
           Piping songs of pleasant glee !
           <br/>
           On a cloud I saw a child,
           <br/>
           And he laughing said to me :
           <br/>
           ‘Pipe a song about a Lamb !’
           <br/>
           So I piped with merry cheer. ,
           <br/>
           ‘Drop thy pipe, thy happy pipe ;
           <br/>
           Sing the songs of happy cheer ;
           <br/>
           So I sang the same again,
           <br/>
           While he wept with joy to hear.
           <br/>
           ‘Piper, sit thee down, and write
           <br/>
           In a book that all may read,’
           <br/>
           So he vanish’d from my sight,
           <br/>
           And I pluck’d a hollow- reed,
           <br/>
           And I made a rural pen,
           <br/>
           And I stain’d the water clear,
           <br/>
           And I wrote my happy songs
           <br/>
           Every child may joy to hear.

           Began to feel as well he might,
           <br/>
           The keen demands of appetite ;
           <br/>
           When, looking eagerly around,
           <br/>
           He spied far off, upon the ground,
           <br/>
           A something shining in the dark,
           <br/>
           And knew the glow-worm by his spark ;
           <br/>
           So, stooping down from hawthorn top,
           <br/>
           He thought to put him in his crop.
           <br/>
           The worm, aware of his intent,
           <br/>
           Harangued him thus, right eloquent—
           <br/>
           “Did you admire my lamp”, quoth he,
           <br/>
           “As much as I your minstrelsy
           <br/>
           You would abhor to do me wrong,
           <br/>
           As much as I to spoil your song ;
           <br/>
           For ’twas the self-same power divine,
           <br/>
           Taught you to sing, and me to shine ;
           <br/>
           That you with music, I with light,
           <br/>
           Might beautify and cheer the night.”
           <br/>
           The songster heard his short oration,
           <br/>
           And warbling out his approbation
           <br/>
           Released him, as my story tells,
           <br/>
           And found a supper somewhere else.

            The Lion and the Echo
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           1 The king of the Beasts deep in the wood,
           <br/>
           Roared as loudly as it could.
           <br/>
           Right away the echo came back
           <br/>
           And the lion thought itself under attack.
          </p>
<p>
           2 “What voice is that roars like mine ?”
           <br/>
           The echo replied “Mine, mine…”
          </p>
<p>
           3 “Who might you be ?” asked the furious lion
           <br/>
           “I’m King of this jungle, this jungle is mine.”
           <br/>
           And the echo came back a second time,
           <br/>
           ‘This jungle is mine, is mine, is mine.”
          </p>
<p>
           4 The lion swore revenge if only it could
           <br/>
           Discover the intruder in the wood.
           <br/>
           It roared, “Coward! Come out and show yourself!’
           <br/>
           But the fearless echo replied simply “…elf, elf”
          </p>
<p>
           5 “Come out,” said the lion, “enough deceit,
           <br/>
           Do you fear, for your own defeat ?
           <br/>
           But all the echo did was repeat
           <br/>
           “Defeat., .defeat.. .defeat…”
          </p>
<p>
           6 Frightened by every conceivable sound,
           <br/>
           The exhausted lion sank to the ground.
           <br/>
           A bird in a tree looked down and it said
           <br/>
           “Dear lion, I’m afraid that what you hear
           <br/>
           Is simply the voice of your lion-sized fear !”

            Passage 8
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           The good old man humbly asked for the ashes. Though the covetous couple turned up their noses at him and scolded him as if he were a thief, they let him fill his basket with the ashes.
          </p>
<p>
           On coming home, the old man took his wife into the garden. It being winter, their favourite cherry tree was bare. He sprinkled a pinch of ashes on it, and, lo ! It sprouted blossoms until it became a cloud of pink blooms which perfumed the air. The news of this filled the village, and everyone ran out to see the wonder.
           <br/>
           The covetous couple also heard the story, and, gathering up the remaining ashes of the mill, kept them to make withered trees blossom.

<strong>
            Passage 9
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           Once (once only) I went absent-mindedly into his shop in a pair of boots bought in an emergency at some large firm. He took my order without showing me any leather and I could feel his eyes penetrating the inferior covering of my foot. At last he said, “Dose are nod my boods.”
          </p>
<p>
           The tone was not one of anger, nor of sorrow, not even of contempt, but there was in it something quiet that froze the blood. He put his hand down and pressed a finger on the place where the left boot was not quite comfortable.
           <br/>
           “Id ‘urds’ you dere,” he said, “Dose big virms’ ave no self-respect.” And then, as if something had given way within him, he spoke long and bitterly. It was the only time I ever heard him discuss the conditions and hardships of his trade.
