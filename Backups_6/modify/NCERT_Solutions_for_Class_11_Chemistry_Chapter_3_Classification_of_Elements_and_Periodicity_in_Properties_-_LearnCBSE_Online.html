<strong>
        Question 1.
       </strong>
</span>
<br/>
      What is the basic theme of organisation in the periodic table?
      <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
        Solution.
       </strong>
</span>
<br/>
      By 1865, number of identified elements was 63 and with such a large number of elements it was very difficult to study individually the chemistry of all these elements and their innumerable compounds individually. To ease out this problem, scientists searched for a systematic way to organize their knowledge by classifying the elements. Here comes the basis of periodic table. Various elements have now been divided into different groups on the basis of similarities in chemical properties. This has made the study simpler as now the properties of elements are studied in groups rather than individually.
     </p>
<p>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
        Question 2.
       </strong>
</span>
<br/>
      Which important property did Mendeleev use to classify the elements in his periodic table and did he stick to it?
      <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
        Solution.
       </strong>
</span>
<br/>
      Mendeleev arranged elements in horizontal rows and vertical columns of a table in order of their increasing atomic weights in such a way that the elements with similar properties occupied the same vertical column or group. He realized that some of the elements did not fit in with his scheme of classification if the order of atomic weight was strictly followed. So, he did not stick to his criteria, he ignored the order of atomic weights, thinking that the atomic measurements might be incorrect, and placed the elements with similar properties together.

<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
        Question 3.
       </strong>
</span>
<br/>
      What is the basic difference in approach between the Mendeleev’s Periodic Law and the Modern Periodic Law?
      <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
        Solution.
       </strong>
</span>
<br/>
      According to Mendeleev’s periodic law, the physical and chemical properties of the elements are periodic functions of their atomic masses, but according to modern periodic law, the physical and chemical properties of the elements are periodic functions of their atomic numbers.
     </p>
<p>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
        Question 4.
       </strong>
</span>
<br/>
      On the basis of quantum numbers, justify that the sixth period of the periodic table should have 32 elements.
      <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
        Solution.
       </strong>
</span>
<br/>
      In the sixth period, the orbitals to be filled are 6s, 4f, 5d and 6p. The complete filling of these orbitals require 2 + 14 + 10 + 6 = 32 electrons, hence, the sixth period of the periodic table should have 32 elements.
     </p>
<p>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
        Question 5.
       </strong>
</span>
<br/>
      In terms of period and group where would you locate the element with Z= 114?
      <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
        Solution.
       </strong>
</span>
<br/>
      The outermost electronic configuration of element (
      <sub>
       114
      </sub>
      Z) is
      <br/>
      [Rn] 5f
      <sup>
       14
      </sup>
      6d
      <sup>
       10
      </sup>
      7s
      <sup>
       2
      </sup>
      7p
      <sup>
       2
      </sup>
      . It has n = 7, so period → 7 It belongs to p-block so,
      <br/>
      group number = 10 + 4 = 14.
     </p>
<p>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
        Question 6.
       </strong>
</span>
<br/>
      Write the atomic number of the element present in the third period and seventeenth group of the periodic table.
      <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
        Solution.
       </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<sub>
       17
      </sub>
      Cl → It belongs to the third period. So, outermost shell is n = 3. Its configuration is [Ne] 3s
      <sup>
       2
      </sup>
      3p
      <sup>
       5
      </sup>
      .
      <br/>
      Therefore, its atomic number = 17.

      Seaborg’s group?
      <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
        Solution.
       </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<strong>
       (i)
      </strong>
      Lawrencium  →

<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
        Question 8.
       </strong>
</span>
<br/>
      Why do elements in the same group have similar physical and chemical properties?
      <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
        Solution.
       </strong>
</span>
<br/>
      In a group, the chemical properties of the elements remain nearly the same due to same valence shell configuration.

<strong>
        Question 9.
       </strong>
</span>
<br/>
      What does atomic radius and ionic radius really mean to you?
      <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
        Solution.
       </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<strong>
       Atomic radius:
      </strong>
      It is the distance between the centre of the nucleus and outermost shell where electrons are present.
      <br/>
<strong>
       Ionic radius :
      </strong>
      It is the distance between the nucleus and outermost shell of an ion.
     </p>
<p>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
        Question 10.
       </strong>
</span>
<br/>
      How do atomic radius vary in a period and in a group? How do you explain the variation?
      <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
        Solution.
       </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<strong>
       Variation of atomic radii in a period :
      </strong>
<br/>
      As we move from left to right across a period, there is regular decrease in atomic radii of representative elements. This can be explained on the basis of effective nuclear charge which increases gradually in a period, i.c, electron cloud is attracted more strongly towards nucleus as the effective nuclear charge becomes more and more along the period. The increased force of attraction brings contraction in size.

</div>
<p>
<strong>
       Variation of atomic radii in a group :
      </strong>
      Atomic radii in a group increase as the atomic number increases. The increase in size is due to extra energy shell which outweighs the effect of increased nuclear charge.

        Question 13.
       </strong>
</span>
<br/>
      Explain why cations are smaller and anions larger in radii than their parent atoms?
      <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
        Solution.
       </strong>
</span>
<br/>
      A cation is smaller than its parent atom because it has fewer electrons while its nuclear charge remains the same. The size of an anion will be larger than that of the parent atom because the addition of one or more electrons would result in increased repulsion among the electrons and a decrease in effective nuclear charge.

<strong>
        Question 14.
       </strong>
</span>
<br/>
      What is the significance of the terms – ‘isolated gaseous atom’and’ground state’while defining the ionization enthalpy and electron gain enthalpy? [Hint: Requirements for comparison purposes.]
      <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
        Solution.
       </strong>
</span>
<br/>
      In the definition of ionization enthalpy and electron gain enthalpy, isolated gaseous atom is required for comparison purposes. Ionization energy is the minimum amount of energy required to remove most loosely bound electron from an isolated atom in the gaseous state of an element so as to convert it into gaseous monovalent positive ion. Electron gain enthalpy is the energy change accompanying the process of adding an electron to a gaseous isolated atom to convert it into a negative ion, i.e., a monovalent anion.
     </p>
<p>
      Both the above mentioned processes are carried out on an isolated gaseous atom, which in turn is obtained from either the excitation of a ground state atom (in case the element is monoatomic) or atomisation of polyatomic elements.
     </p>
<p>
      The force with which an electron is attracted by the nucleus is appreciably affected by presence of other atoms in the neighbourhood. Since in the gaseous state the atoms are widely separated, therefore these interatomic forces are minimum.
      <br/>
      The term ground state means that the atom must be present in the most stable state.

<strong>

       </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<strong>
       (i)
      </strong>
      An s-electron is attracted to the nucleus more than a p-electron. In beryllium, the electron removed during the ionization is an s-electron whereas the electron removed during ionization of boron is a p-electron. The penetration of a 2s-electron to the nucleus is more than that of a 2p-electron; hence the 2 p electron of boron is more shielded from the nucleus by the inner core of electrons than the 2s electrons of beryllium. Therefore, it is easier to remove the 2p-electron from boron as compared to the removal of a 2s-electron from beryllium. Thus, boron has a smaller first ionization enthalpy than beryllium.

        Question 18.
       </strong>
</span>
<br/>
      What are the various factors due to which the ionization enthalpy of the main group elements tends to decrease down a group?
      <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
        Solution.
       </strong>
</span>
<br/>
      We have to consider two factors :
      <br/>
<strong>
       (i)
      </strong>
      the attraction of electrons towards the nucleus, and
      <strong>
       (ii)
      </strong>
      the repulsion of electrons from each other. The effective nuclear charge experienced by a valence electron in an atom will be less than the actual charge on the nucleus because of shielding or screening of the valence electron from the nucleus by the intervening core electrons. As we descend the group, the outermost electron being increasingly farther from the nucleus, there is an increased shielding of the nuclear charge by the electrons in the inner levels. The increase in shielding outweighs the increasing nuclear charge and the removal of the outermost electron requires less energy down a group.

<br/>
<strong>
       (i) O or F :
      </strong>
      F has more negative electron gain enthalpy than O due to smaller size, higher nuclear charge and greater possibility of attaining the nearest stable noble gas configuration by gaining one electron.
      <br/>
<strong>
       (ii) F or Cl :
      </strong>
      Cl has more negative electron gain enthalpy because in F the incoming electron is added to the smaller n = 2 quantum level and suffers significant repulsion from the other electrons present in this level. In Cl, the added electron goes to n = 3 quantum level and occupies a larger region of space and electron-electron repulsion experienced is far less.

<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
        Solution.
       </strong>
</span>
<br/>
      The distance between the nucleus and the outermost shell of an ion is known as ionic radius.
      <br/>
<strong>
       (a)
      </strong>
      The gain of an electron leads to the formation of an anion. The radius of the anion is larger than the atomic radius of its parent atom because the addition of one or more electrons would result in increased repulsion among the electrons and a decrease in effective nuclear charge which acts on more electrons so, each electron is held less tightly and thereby the electron cloud expands.
     </p>
<p>
<strong>
       (b)
      </strong>
      The removal of an electron from an atom results in the formation of a cation. A cation is smaller than its parent atom because it has fewer electrons while its nuclear charge remains the same and since it is now acting on lesser number of electrons and pulls them closer, the ion is smaller.

        Question 28.

</span>
<br/>
      The increasing order of reactivity among group 1 elements is Li &lt; Na &lt; K &lt; Rb &lt; Cs whereas that among group 17 elements is F &gt; Cl &gt; Br &gt; I. Explain.
      <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
        Solution.
       </strong>
</span>
<br/>
      The trend Li &lt; Na &lt; K &lt; Rb &lt; Cs is observed for chemical reactivity because upon descending the group the ionization energy of alkali metals decreases i.e., it is easy for them to lose an electron from their valence shell and attain the nearest stable noble gas configuration. The trend F &gt; Cl &gt; Br &gt; I is observed for chemical reactivity in halogens because the standard reduction potential decreases as we descend the group. F being the most electronegative readily accepts an e~ to complete its octet and hence the trend.
