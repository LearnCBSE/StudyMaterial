           <br/>
           My dear Manu
           <br/>
           I hope you are hale and hearty. Nevertheless, I am sure you will not be feeling very comfortable in Delhi. It must be very cold there. Yet, it may surprise you that I have visited Simla last week. Instead of feeling uncomfortable, I enjoyed myself a lot.
          </p>
<p>
           It was the end of December. The usual crowds of summer days were absent. We got a comfortable room. In the morning, I opened the window. What a scene ! It was snowing all around. We were two persons in the room. Both of us dressed ourselves well and came out in the open. It was my first experience of enjoying the snow-fall.
           <br/>
           1 kept on the road for a long time.

           In the afternoon, I watched an exciting programme of ice-skating. I could not participate in it. Yet, it was a treat to watch.
           <br/>
           With love.
           <br/>
           Yours affectionately

            B. Formal/Business Letters

</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           1. Business letters should be short and to the point. Businessmen are always busy. They have no time to read long and confusing letters.
           <br/>
           2. The style is always very formal. Certain terms of polite expressions are used, such as—
          </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
           “I shall be much obliged if you send me,”
           <br/>
           “Please despatch at your earliest convenience,” etc.
          </p>
<p>
           3. Business jargon should be avoided.
           <br/>
           4. Avoid abbreviations as far as possible.
           <br/>
           5. While ordering goods, care should be taken to give clear and exact descriptions of the articles wanted. If you are making a complaint, it should also be very clear though polite.
          </p>
<p>
           See the following examples of business letters :
           <br/>

           We are thankful for your sending the books as per our order dated 11.3.2017. However, on opening the parcel, we have found that the books are damaged. The title pages of almost all the books are badly tom.

<p>
           1. To Municipal Commissioner about the problem of stray dogs
           <br/>
           You are Anju/Anuj Grover living at 146 Rohtas Nagar, Delhi-91. Your colony is facing the problem of stray dogs. Even the movements of its residents have become risky specially in the evenings. Stating the difficulties, write a letter in about 100 words to the Municipal Authorities of your city, to tackle the problem in an effective manner.
           <br/>

           Delhi
           <br/>
           Sir
           <br/>
           Please allow me to draw your attention to the nuisance created by the stray dogs in this colony.
           <br/>
           The dogs have always been there. But they were never before as dangerous as they are today. These days, the residents fear to ‘pass through the colony. The threat of being bitten by a dog is very strong. New pups are very large in number. A stranger is likely to put his foot on one of them. Many of the dogs suffer from skin
           <br/>
           diseases. When these dogs die their bodies keep lying in the street. During evenings, the residents can’t move freely. They fear stepping over them.
           <br/>
           Kindly take the necessary steps to help the residents of this colony.
           <br/>
           Yours sincerely
           <br/>

           <br/>
           Sir
           <br/>
           I want to invite your kind attention towards the rising rate of crime in the city. Everyday we read in the newspapers about crimes and murders. The old men and women are murdered. Their valuables are stolen. Crime graph against women is rising high. Women and young girls fear to go out alone in the evenings. Rapes, chain snatchings etc, occur daily. Anti-social elements move freely without any fear. They strike when they see a lonely woman or a girl. Life has become very fearful due to the high rate of crime.
          </p>
<p>
           Under the circumstances, I request you to look into the matter without delay. Please take a strict action against the criminals. The policemen not discharging their duties sincerely should be punished. I hope these steps shall help in bringing down the crime.
           <br/>
           Thanking you

           3. To the District Magistrate about the nuisaiice of loudspeakers

           <br/>
           Sir
           <br/>
           Kindly allow me to draw your attention to the nuisance of air pollution. I would request you to take proper action to improve the quality of air in the city.
          </p>
<p>
           A few years back, Pantnagar was a very quiet town. People in it felt proud of its clean surroundings. But of late the people seem to have forgotten the value of peace. All through the day, loudspeakers play at high pitch. When there is a marriage or jagran, one can’t sleep even during the night.
          </p>
<p>
           These are the examination days. The students can’t study due to this noise. I, therefore, request you kindly to look into the matter personally and give us some relief.
           <br/>
           With thanks

           <br/>
           Dear Sir
           <br/>
           You will agree that our locality is, perhaps, the dirtiest in the district. The reason is simple. It is the locality which has kaccha roads. These roads become muddy with a little rainfall. The water stays on the roads almost all through the year. There is no drainage. The stagnant water creates pits and pools. There have occurred many fatal accidents due to these potholes.
           <br/>
           There is a small dispensary in the locality. It is too small to do anything worthwhile for the people. Here too the doctor is generally absent.
           <br/>
           While the streets are full of water, the water-taps are generally dry. The electricity plays hide and seek all the time. The conditions are so bad that many people have already left this locality.
           <br/>
           Please do something to solve these problems of this locality.
           <br/>
           Yours faithfully

           Dear Sir
           <br/>
           I want to draw your attention to the poor bus service to and from our locality. The buses seem not to follow any time-table. They generally run late. Sometimes some buses pass much before time. Irregularity is the rule.
           <br/>
           The number of buses from our locality for major routes is also insufficient. The passengers have to wait for about 30 minutes if they miss a bus. Kindly increase the number of buses particularly in the morning and the evening. This will solve the problem of over-crowding too.
           <br/>
           One great trouble is the road-worthiness of these buses. I think that the buses are veiy old. They quite often stop mid-way adding to our woes.
           <br/>
           Kindly look into the matter personally and oblige.
           <br/>
           Yours

           You are Kalyani Shankar of Kendriya Vidyalaya Karol Bagh New Delhi. You are very worried about the increasing pollution in your city. Write a letter to the Editor of a newspaper expressing your concern.

           Sir
           <br/>
           Please permit me to use some valuable space of your newspaper. I wish to make the public and the government aware of an important problem. This is the increasing pollution in our city.
           <br/>
           There are three types of pollution—air, water and noise. Let me congratulate the Delhi Government for putting some brakes on air pollution. This, they did, a few years ago by introducing C.N.G. However, nobody seems to bother about water and noise pollution. The tap water in Delhi is seldom clean. The rich are using water purifiers. What about the poor ? They fall ill and go to government hospitals. Thus government has to bear the cost of giving impure water. The people also suffer. Noise pollution is a big menace. It is no longer a secret that most people of our city have some hearing problem. We can no more hear soft sounds. Some people have gone completely deaf— all because of noise pollution.
           <br/>
           With regards
           <br/>
           Yours faithfully

           Lucknow Dear Sir
           <br/>
           Please permit me some space in your newspaper. I wish to draw the attention of the government towards the supply of electricity in Lucknow.
           <br/>
           The lack of electricity supply is causing much trouble to this city. The supply we get is not only short but also highly irregular. We do not know about the hours of cut.
           <br/>
           It has also affected the supply of water. If there is no light in the morning, there is no water either. The local water board also depends on the supply of electricity. Streets are dark in the night. It causes accidents. The students cannot study well. I wish to make an urgent appeal to every person concerned to help.
           <br/>

           Dear Sir
           <br/>
           Through your newspaper, I wish to raise my voice against the misuse of public property. There are large scale encroachments on the pavements and public parks. The roads have shrunk because shopkeepers have occupied the pavements. Some daring shopkeepers have occupied the public parks also.
           <br/>
           I appeal to the authorities to use force against such people. If the roads become free from encroachments, there will be no traffic-jams.
           <br/>
