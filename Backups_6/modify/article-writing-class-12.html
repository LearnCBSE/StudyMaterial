<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           The number of women in the police force seems insufficient especially when we see the increasing involvement of women in terrorist activities. Write an article in 150-200 words for The Hindustan Chronicle’, on the need of having more women in the police force. (2010)
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
           Need Of Having More
           <br/>
           Women In The Police Force
          </p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.aplustopper.com/women-empowerment-speech/">
            Women empowerment
           </a>
           and participation has seen a radical improvement in the recent few decades. Women are no longer confined to their homes and have come forward to excel in almost all fields, at par with men. But it has been observed that the number of women in the police force seems insufficient especially when we compare their increasing number in terrorist activities. Women are sure to prove their worth in the police force as they are more committed to the cause they work for and less corrupt, two qualities that are lacking in policemen. The government needs to increase the reserved quota for recruitment of women in the police force. Women need to be given incentives to join the police force and this is sure to prove favourable as they bring with them a distinctly different and valuable set of skills that is bound to change the way the police is perceived in our community. As the job description of the police expands beyond crime-fighting into community service the presence of more women in the police force is sure to help to burnish the tarnished image of the police officers, improve community relations and foster a more flexible and less violent approach to maintaining law and order.

<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           In many parts of our country girls are still discouraged from going to school. Consequently, a sizable section of the population is deprived of education. Schemes like Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, CBSE scholarship to the single girl child and the Government’s policy of giving free education to girls have come as a boon to our society. Write an article in 150-200 words on the education of the girl child in the country. (Delhi 2010)
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
           Education Of The Girl
           <br/>
           Child In The Country
          </p>
<p>
           Education of girls has been a high priority with the Government of India. In the new millennium, India has consolidated its earlier educational reforms with increased resources and stronger policy commitments for achieving elementary education, particularly for girls. Reaching out to the girl child is primary to the efforts to universalise elementary education. ‘Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan’ or ‘Education For All’ programme recognizes that ensuring the education of the girl child requires changes not only in the education system but also in society’s norms and attitudes.
          </p>
<p>
           A two-pronged gender strategy has hence been adopted to make the educational system responsive to the needs of the girls through targeted interventions which serve as a pull-factor to enhance access and retention of girls in schools on the one hand and generate community demand for girls’ education through training and mobilisation on the other hand. The CBSE has also come up with the novel scheme of providing free education from the sixth standard onwards to the single girl child. The need of the times is that the government should further improve the educational infrastructure and make it more accessible and meaningful for the girl child.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Advertisements have become a big business. They are promoted by celebrities drawn from various fields like films, sports, etc., leaving their influence on all people specially the young. Write an article in 150-200 words on ‘The Impact of Advertisements on the younger generation’. (Delhi 2010)
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p style="text-align: center;">
           Impact Of Advertisements On
           <br/>
           The Younger Generation
          </p>
<p>
           The advertisement industry has a tremendous impact on the younger generation. As citizens of the modern world, advertisements have become a part of the daily lives of youngsters and they have got used to being bombarded with numerous advertisements over the course of their day.
          </p>
<p>
           Advertisements have become so common for them that they often do not even realize that they are hearing or viewing them. So they have a pervasive influence on the youth. In the ever-expanding world of consumerism and advertising, companies are constantly looking for new ways to sell their products to the youngsters by making their commercials and campaigns more memorable, to leave an impact on their minds. The younger generation has become their prime target because they have more spending power than ever before and increased avenues at their disposal. Therefore companies spend enormous amounts of money to rope in popular film stars, cricketers, musicians etc. to endorse their products.
          </p>
<p>
           This helps to ensure popularity and early brand loyalty. In the last decade many superbrands have looked towards new and outrageous ways to capture young audiences through appealing campaigns as these youngsters are cognitively and psychologically quite defenceless against advertisements. Clearly, advertisements represent ‘big business’ and has a significant effect on young people who need to be educated about the effects of advertising, that is, media literacy. This will prove to be helpful in mitigating the harmful effects of advertising on youngsters.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           The present-day youth are greatly stressed due to cut-throat competition and consumerist culture. Write an article in 150-200 words on the causes of the stress on the modem generation suggesting suitable solutions. (Delhi 2010)
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
           Causes Of Stress On
           <br/>
           The Modern Generation
          </p>
<p>
           The main cause of stress on the modern generation is the cut-throat competition and consumerist culture prevalent in our society. This always puts them under pressure of efficiency and productivity. The modern environment is highly competitive and calls for relentless effort on the part of each youngster. To achieve the goals they have to devote all their time and capacity, without rest. So they have no time to care even for their own selves. They have no time for relaxing or to pursue something of their own interest sounds like a luxury to them. The effects of this stress on the youth also visible in their physical being whereby they have increased pulses and a lot of tension in their muscles.
          </p>
<p>
           With increased professionalism and specialisation there seems no practical and suitable solution for this stress due to the competition. In this age of consumerism, it is not surprising that the youth of today are also constantly vying to outdo each other in acquiring material things. But now it is high time each one of us sat back in quiet introspection to contemplate where we are actually heading in this high-speed pace. Our health and well-being will have to be our primary concern for, as they say, “a healthy mind lies in a healthy body”. Let us stop living like robots. We are humans and have to behave likewise and not like machines which are our own creation.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           As compared to the older generation the youth of today are greatly inclined to pursue adventurous activities either for money or for
           <br/>
           fun. There is a latest craze for joining reality shows, rafting, rock climbing, mountaineering etc. Write an article in 150-200 words on which life you would prefer—safe or adventurous. (All India 2010)
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
           Live Life, Don’t Just Exist
          </p>
<p>
           To lead a life of adventure is certainly very exciting and amazing. It involves breaking free of certain social conditioning and challenging yourself to work upon your mental fears, which are mostly in your mind, and discovering unlimited freedom and opportunities. We, therefore, need to be willing to undertake adventure as it is a necessary part of happy existence. It is important to spend your limited time on earth doing some of those things that make a difference and give one enjoyment rather than simply sinking all the time playing the normal routine game of “delayed gratification”.
          </p>
<p>
           Taking action helps one to build a more enriching life and enables you to embrace life with more passion each day. The desire for sameness never contributors to anything exciting but makes our life and spirit dull. A variety of sports and recreation are adventurous to a lot of people today. Some people race cars, skydivers jump out of a 5 aeroplane, mountain-climbers scale peaks etc. This helps them to escape their daily stress and gives them a ‘high’. So it is important to live life to the fullest and it is also surely worth making the effort to ‘live’ with an adventurous spirit.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 6.
           <br/>
           India is standing at the threshold of joining the developed nations but that is not possible till we achieve complete literacy in the country. The contribution of students may be very significant in achieving our goals. Write an article in 150-200 words on ‘The Role of the Students in Removing Illiteracy’. (All India 2010)
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
           The Role Of Students In
           <br/>
           Removing Illiteracy
          </p>
<p>
           Illiteracy is still a major blot on India, after more than sixty years of its achieving independence. To an extent it exemplifies India’s failure to reach out to its masses. The removal of illiteracy has to be tackled on a priority basis and students can play an important role in achieving this goal. Since they are in the process of receiving education themselves they are most appropriate for also putting forth their services to achieve the goal of educating the illiterate masses. Students should be encouraged to carry the lamp of knowledge by organizing events such as, ‘Each One, Teach One’.

           If every student resolves to teach two illiterate persons in a year during his vacations, it will in the long run help to eradicate illiteracy. The government should also render full support to students in terms of infrastructure in their contribution to the Indian Literacy Campaign. Students can also play a vital role in the programme of Adult Literacy. If all our students get together and try to work towards achieving literacy among the masses, then the day is not far when India too will join the league of countries that have attained hundred percent literacy.

<p style="text-align: center;">
           Value-Based Education
          </p>
<p>
           Value-based education is an educational philosophy, an approach to teaching and learning that underpins away a school organises itself develops relationships and promotes positive human values. Schools that adopt such an approach report that there is a qualitative improvement in pupils’ attitude and behaviour. The purpose of value-based education is to help the school community think about and reflect upon positive universal values and practical implications of expressing them in relation to themselves and the community as a whole.
          </p>
<p>
           Value-based education also supports schools in promoting an inclusive school ethos and the methods of working raise achievements and help pupils to raise their self-esteem and take responsibility for their own behaviour and learning. It also enables students to examine the kind of life that is worth living and to consider what kind of life they want for themselves. At the core of value-based education lies an agreed set of principles, deeply held convictions that underpin all aspects of school life and work. The process is holistic and developmental, demanding a greater deal from the school’s community. Value-based education is thus a philosophy for developing and supporting schools of excellence.

           The Problem Of Pollution
           <br/>
           By: Madhav
          </p>
<p>
           Cities, in general, have a great deal in common with vehicles. In fact they often seem to be turning into vehicles. India’s population and its traffic is concentrated within its cities. The increasing number of vehicles in Delhi is putting our city at the risk of completely losing clean air to breathe. Delhi would have, in fact, been buried under a pollution load if the Supreme Court had not intervened to introduce cleaner fuels and emissions technology in the city, in the form of CNG-run public vehicles. Moreover, increase in the number of vehicles also means getting stuck in rush traffic hour which has also become a routine.
          </p>
<p>
           It is high time we now look towards solving this problem of heavy traffic congestion which is taking a toll both on our health and our time. The traffic police department must use technology for controlling and monitoring the movement of vehicles at important and busy crossroads for which the department officials can also take the help of Close Circuit T.V. Drives should be launched to educate the masses about the importance of driving in their respective lanes only and to follow traffic signals strictly. Violation of these should result in fines and in case of repeated offence the driving license of the person should be confiscated.
          </p>
<p>
           Pollution check of vehicles by owners at regular intervals should be made mandatory. This can also contribute a lot in saving the environment from pollution. Thus, we as responsible citizens just need to make a start.

<p>
           By: Vijay
           <br/>
           The problem of corruption is not new though it has reached unprecedented proportions in recent years. It is as old as society itself and •cuts across nations, cultures, races and classes of people. Corruption is rampant in our political and social life and like cancer seems to be gnawing into the vitals of the society. It has been argued that one of the many obstacles to the development of poor countries is corruption. The youth of the society have a lot of responsibility in combating corruption. They are aware of this phenomenon but negligent towards this issue. It is the youth, especially the students, who have to take cudgels against the demon of corruption and crush it altogether.
          </p>
<p>
           A beginning can be made in this direction by holding anti-corruption drives. The ill-effects of corruption in public life should be publicised through the internet, facebook and blogs. The uprising young citizens need to join hands as one and battle against corruption. They need to spread awareness, more so in rural areas and equip them with knowledge about this burning issue. Recently the name of Anna Hazare has become synonymous with combating corruption so the youth of India have an idol among them whom they can follow. The dedicated efforts of the honest youth are bound to succeed in the long run in demolishing and vanquishing this social evil which has earned us a bad name.

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           India is said to be a young country and is emerging as a global power. The youth is getting increasingly concerned about the problems of corruption, environment, pollution, misuse of natural resources, etc. Write an article in 150-200 words on your vision of India in 2040.

           My Vision Of Future India
          </p>
<p>
           Most of us have a massive psychological barrier against looking at the future vision of India and those who see the future as growing directly out of the present also often narrow their vision. It is my belief that the year 2040 will belong to those who try to see diversity as a value in itself, not as an instrument for resisting new monocultures of the mind or as a compromise necessary for maintaining communal and ethical harmony. India of the future will be central to the world where the idea of diversity will be cherished as an end in itself. My vision statement is not a prediction of what will actually occur, nor is it a wish list of desirable but unattainable ends. It is actually a statement of what we believe is possible for our nation to achieve seeing the level of concern that our present-day youth is showing about problems of corruption, environmental pollution, misuse of natural resources, etc. An essential requirement for envisioning India in 2040 is to recognise that the parameters which determine national development have changed i in recent years and will change further in the future. This is likely to open up greater; possibilities than ever before. The growing I influence in the fields of technology, education, information, productive skills etc. lend credence to the view that India will ; definitely achieve and sustain higher economic growth and development in the coming decades.

           Question 11.
           <br/>
           Due to the globalization of food industry and fast food culture, traditional healthy diets are increasingly being replaced by unhealthy junk food containing artificial additives and preservative chemicals. Write an article in 150-200 words for a national daily on the need for inculcating healthy dietary habits. (Comptt. All India 2010)

<p style="text-align: center;">
           Need To Inculcate
           <br/>
           Healthy Dietary Habits
          </p>
<p>
           Due to globalisation and the advent of fast food culture, traditional healthy diets have been replaced by unhealthy junk food that has no nutritional value. Children and even adults have become quite fond of this junk food essentially because it is palatable and caters well to their taste buds. Though junk food does not come with a statutory warning, it is , actually harmful for our health if we eat it on a regular basis as it contains artificial additives and chemical preservatives. Hence the need arises for inculcating healthy dietary habits. I feel childhood is the best stage to inculcate good food habits. Through constant reinforcement and an emphasis on healthy eating choices at home parents can ensure that their kids continue to eat healthy even when they are away from home.
          </p>
<p>
           Parents should remember that kids learn their eating habits from them so they should lead by example and eat healthy themselves. This will encourage their kids to follow in their footsteps. Children’s initial refusal to eat healthy food should not discourage the parents. Repeated exposure to healthy foods like fresh fruits and vegetables, nuts, milk etc. will ensure that the kids might want to try it out at some point. So, constant encouragement is needed to make them try out healthy food but do not force anything. Aim to make good nutrition a way of life than a rule and healthy eating habits will come naturally and not something that is being enforced.

           <br/>
           Travel is an important part of a man’s education. It enables a person to learn manners, customs, languages and history of different people and places and also widens the circle of one’s acquaintances.

           Travel – An Important

           Source Of Education
          </p>
<p>
           To travel is to discover. If not necessary, travel is a very important aspect of education, an experience to learn on personal levels with hands-on experience. When people travel to a new place they absorb and remember information faster and retain it longer just by experiencing it themselves. Travelling to other parts of the country provides the opportunity to see different cultures practising their everyday lives. It also enables a person to learn the manners, customs, languages and history of different people and places and widens the circle of one’s acquaintances. While travelling to each new place gives us a different experience, all of these travels will add up to a worldly view that instils a feeling of connection with people, places and events from all over the globe.
          </p>
<p>
           In the past few years it has become a norm for people from one country to travel to another country as a part of their education programme. As wonderful as it is to read about places and people who interest us, to experience a personal visit to these places and interact personally with these people allows us to understand and even appreciate their world in a more lasting and meaningful way. Our minds open up to new things, people, places and experiences Very few ways allow for greater learning than travel. It is one of the best and most entertaining ways to get an education. While classes, books and internet sites are great ways to learn and build your knowledge base, travel takes what you have already learnt and expands upon it.

           <br/>
           India has made rapid strides in the technological field. Technology has made our life more easygoing and comfortable than ever before. But these comforts bestowed on us through technological advancements is doing us more harm than good. In the 21st century, technology has evolved to accommodate a more convenient lifestyle and meet every need that could possibly need fulfilling. With the right technology in your home, you might just never feel the need to even leave your bed. Our entire lifestyle has slowly but surely been completely taken over by technology. This is having an adverse effect on our well-being. We have become lazy and disease-prone.
          </p>
<p>
           Modern technology has given us everything we want, whenever we want and more than we actually need, with the result that we have become a weak society. Unlike the older generation, modern-day children do not have the space and freedom of moving about and end up cramped in front of their computers and video games. This sedentary style of living causes the child to be antisocial, thus making him socially weak. Also there is added risk of obesity from less locomotion. A sedentary lifestyle, coupled with wrong food habits, has made us prone to illnesses. Though technology has greatly contributed to human development, it has its flip side and it is adversely affecting our health.

           Counsellor and Social Worker Most of the students and their parents are under constant pressure and usually suffer from high levels of stress especially during the time of examinations. This does them no good because it is a parents duty to reduce stress in their children and help them overcome it. Young students should not be left alone to struggle in the most difficult and significant period of their life. They need to get endless support from their parents. Better interaction between students and parents can help to settle various problems amicably and create a relaxed atmosphere during the time of examination. Moreover, parents have to be practical and realistic in their expectations.
          </p>
<p>
           They should always remain positive and acknowledge even the minor achievements of their children. A healthy and meaningful parent-ward rapport can help a student overcome stress easily. Every parent should give their child encouragement and support, especially during academically stressful times. Encourage your child to aim to do their best and be assured that it is the earnest effort they make and not the result that matters the most. Students who live in supportive environments, develop a range of coping strategies and become more resilient.

           <br/>
           Social Worker and Counsellor It has become an unfortunate trend that senior class students are ignoring sports activities due to the pressure of examination and coaching classes. They seem to have forgotten the fact that sports not only promote physical fitness but will also influence their scholastic achievements. Colleges, in an effort and interest, to promote sports and games, encourage the admission of students who have excelled in sports by allotting a sports-quota to them. Besides a fun and exciting way to get involved in competitive physical activities, playing sports in high school can also help with college admissions. Sports provide for a well- rounded character. They help develop skills based on teamwork and comradeship, as well as teach young people how to set goals and persevere through hardships to achieve those goals.
          </p>
<p>
           Moreover, members of the college admission board are aware of the time and commitment that goes into being a part of a team sport. They are more interested in giving admission to those students who are able to strike a keen balance between sports and academics and who show a depth of commitment to a wide range of activities. Participating in sports help to develop these additional traits in a student. Indulging in a sport positively influences academics by providing an avenue to release the pent up pressure and easing the minds of students at the time of examinations.

           When my family shifted from Kota in Rajasthan to Ernakulam in Kerala, I was really excited because I had heard about the diversity of nature one gets to experience in this district. Also, I was extremely happy to be moving away from the dry and arid climate of Rajasthan. But nothing could have ever prepared me for the natural joy I experienced when I reached Ernakulam.

<p>
           Ernakulam is known as the Queen of the Arabian Sea. In addition to getting a glimpse of the traditional rural Kerala lifestyle and the variant villages, to the coconut plantations and the coir villages, it was a relish to see the scenic views of the dense green tropical forests and colourful birds that enveloped us in an aura of peace and warmth and brought us closer to nature. It was a treat to be in the midst of the simple and unsophisticated rustic life and the gorgeous greens. Though Emakulam is a developed district, yet it has managed to retain its natural beauty. It is also one of the finest natural harbours in the world and a major centre of trade and commerce.

<p>
           The Hindu, Chennai Poverty, in one way or another, is the fundamental cause of all evils. It fosters desperation which, in turn, breeds crime. The lack of money breeds all negative characteristics that people loathe; it breeds hatred, anger and jealousy.
          </p>
<p>
           Poverty also breeds racism, classism, ethnicism as the society itself stratifies to define classes to separate the rich from the poor. It makes people dishonest as they will do anything to get even a little bit of scarce money. In today’s world, poverty has become the root cause of all evils, because it has the power and ability to make people compromise their once held and respected values, cultures and religious beliefs. Poverty has created a new race of people with common marks of frustrations, loss of hope, prospects and value of life. Poverty leads to illiteracy, unemployment, dissatisfaction among individuals, corruption and crime and all these handicaps not only the growth of individuals but also the growth of the nation as a whole. There is an urgent need also to find solutions to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor.
          </p>

           Obesity among school children is a global problem that is on the rise. It appears to increase the risk of subsequent morbidity, whether or not obesity persists into adulthood.
          </p>
<p>
           Recent studies on urban Indian school children report a high prevalence of obese and overweight children. Outcomes related to childhood obesity include hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, orthopaedic and psychosocial problems.
          </p>
<p>
           The present generation children are more of couch-potatoes who refrain from indulging in any kind of physical activity and are confined indoors most of the time. They have neither the urge nor the time to play outdoor games. A majority of children prefer to spend their time either glued to the television or the computer. Lack of physical activity combined with eating junk food makes children easy prey to diseases and ailments which were never heard of in childhood. Added to this is the lack of time because of which a child’s parents and teachers are unable to pay due attention to the child’s diet.
          </p>
<p>
           The need of the hour is thus a possible role of change in the dietary pattern and the physical activities of children so as to ensure that they lead healthy lives. Games, yoga and other sports should be made a compulsory part of school curriculum. Also it is imperative that all junk food is banned from school canteens which should replace this with healthy nutritious foods.

<p>
           Modern gadgets have enslaved us. They have made the world jump forward with a leap, built a glittering civilization, opened up innumerable avenues for the growth of knowledge, and added to the power of man to such an extent that it is possible to conceive that man could triumph over and shape his physical environment.
          </p>
<p>
           Our life is driven by gadgets and gizmos so much so that we cannot imagine even a day without them. On the domestic front, electronic kitchen appliances have proved to be a boon for housewives and relieved pressure off them. The biggest brands in mobile phones are also focusing on the present day needs and visualising them in their gadgets. Our life comes to a pause whenever we are disconnected from the internet. Education, communication, commerce and industry are all dependent on modern gadgets.
          </p>
<p>
           These modem gadgets have brought us to a height of extreme convenience to such an extent that we have forgotten our roots of simplicity—the simplicity of doing things ourselves instead of a ‘machine’ doing it for us, the simplicity of working together physically instead of creating our own workspace at home, confining ourselves to a lonesome boundary in life.
          </p>

           Life has really widened its prospect and with these modem gadgets around we can do everything happily and conveniently. We can do our personal stuff on these and make them an important ‘member’ of our life.

<p>
           It is indeed astonishing how people in our country can be so devoid of civic sense. It is not considered as an important value so it is not inculcated in children at a very young age and is not practised and encouraged at home.
          </p>
<p>
           When people talk about cleanliness of public places in India, civic sense or the lack of it is often quoted as one of the prime reasons for the squalor that we see all around us. And this horrid state of apathy is not limited to the lower and uneducated sections of society. Even the affluent and educated folks are devoid of civic sense. This is because civic sense is not inculcated in us from a very young age. Therefore steps should be taken up to inculcate civic education at the school level itself. Incentives should be given to people who show and practise civic sense. Use of dustbins should be encouraged and there should be stringent laws for those who flout basic civic sense.
          </p>
<p>
           This change has to come from within each individual. If things are left to rot they become self-perpetuating. Each one of us should try to resolve, to breathe and reside in a pristine and hygienic surrounding.

           Cruelty To Animals
           <br/>
           By: Nikhil
          </p>
<p>
           Cruelty to animals or animal abuse is the human infliction of suffering or harm upon animals for purposes other than self-defence or survival. Animals are being beaten up and starved every day and millions of animals die each year because of human atrocities.
          </p>
<p>
           The plight of stray dogs and cows is a common sight in India. It is inhuman to let them roam around on the streets, let them eat garbage dumped on the roadsides and exposing them to being hit by fast-moving traffic. Ill-treatment and cruelty of these helpless creatures should be stringently discouraged. Shelter homes should be created for stray animals. To create awareness regarding the ill-treatment of animals campaigns, drives and street plays need to be organized. Moreover, we need to observe Animal Rights Day.
          </p>
<p>
           Though we have a long way to go, but gradually by making the public more aware about the issues of animal cruelty and by making the society realise the importance of animal rights, we will eventually learn to live in harmony with them.

           Terrorism has swallowed law and order. Terrorist activities have knitted their web across our nation and act as a major threat to the society and lives of billions of civilians: Terrorism in India is very deep-rooted and complicated and has been a social stigma in our society. Its causes vary from political, religious fanaticism, intolerance, fundamentalism, social and economic factors. In our approach to I terrorism, we fail to distinguish it from the use of violence or armed struggle in a revolutionary situation. In spite of the magnitude of the problem of terrorism, there has been no consensus on a solution to this problem. In India the attempts to control terrorism have been mainly through the deployment of police, military and paramilitary forces. More steps need to be taken up to control terrorism. There should be a political will to tackle terrorism. Vigilance should be improved and awareness should be created through the media.
          </p>
<p>
           Ultimately it is only by improving social, economic and political conditions and by fostering the forces of democracy and secularism, peace and stability that the battle against violence and terrorism can be won.

<p>
           By: NA VITA
           <br/>
           Being eighteen is fun but also a bit tough. It is that stage of life when we have to cope with many changes in our life. The most important thing about being a eighteen is the responsibilities that come with it.
          </p>
<p>
           We are still considered young but our mind starts forming opinions though we are not considered old enough to express them. We are given a little more freedom. We start to creep into the adult world and encounter some new experiences. In these years of our life we are discovering ourselves, new opportunities, new duties and responsibilities. We have lesser responsibilities as compared to our elders but we are definitely responsible for our actions. This can sometimes work to our disadvantage as at this phase of our life we are always willing to try out new things and in some of these we may falter.
          </p>
<p>
           One of the joys of being 18 years old is that we can get a driving license and hence drive. This gives us a sense of independence. Moreover we can rationalize every crazy thing we do by stating the fact that we are still teenagers. Another major joy is the fact that we can vote at eighteen and feel accountable towards choosing our leaders. There is definitely a pressure even while we have loads of fun. So being eighteen is at times stressful but an exciting stage of one’s life. It is not a bed of roses but, neither is it a bed of thorns and we must enjoy this short yet eventful phase of our life.

           Women Safety In India
           <br/>
           By: NAVTE.
          </p>
<p>
           Since the unfortunate December, 2012 incident in Delhi, women security is now a big question in India than it was before. Why aren’t Indian females safe? Who is responsible for their safety? How should their safety be assured?
          </p>
<p>
           These three questions have become features on our national agenda.
          </p>
<p>
           Concerns about safety restrict the mobility and activity of women and leave them with no choice but to strategise everything from timings to travel, how to walk, how to dress or commute. When we talk about women’s safety, the biggest question is how do we keep our mothers, sisters and daughters safe against violence outside the house. Women are often stared at, molested and discriminated against. Not only outside the house, they are even discriminated against at the workplace and in their homes. It is surely the responsibility of the government and each one of us strive for a safer world for women. Effective implementation of strict laws protecting women’s’ rights is the need of the hour. Offenders must be socially boycotted and severely punished to deter future crimes against women. Another imperative step is teaching self-defense techniques to women and girls at schools, colleges, offices and residential colonies.
          </p>
<p>
           As long as the mindset of people will not change, women can never be safe. All we need to do is to be alert and considerate. We have to develop basic morality and nurture a value system that teaches respect for women.
          </p>
<p>
           Women are not safe anywhere in the globe until the thinking towards women changes. So the actual need of the hour is a revolutionary change in the mindsets and conscience of men so that they view women with regard and respect.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 25.
           <br/>
           Emotionally as well as intellectually, a woman is as good as a man if not better. Yet we don’t allow her the same status as a man enjoys in society. Write an article in 150-200 words on ‘Status of Women in Society’. You are Navtej/Navita. (Delhi 2015)

           Status Of Women In Society
           <br/>
           By: Navita
          </p>
<p>
           Women are emotionally and intellectually at par with their men counterparts but unfortunately, they are not given the same status that a man enjoys in the society.
          </p>
<p>
           It is generally seen and believed that women have lower status in context to power and influence than men in all spheres of life family, community, religion and politics. Certain scholars have attributed this inferior status of women to the patriarchal code of living. Though our Constitution has laid down the equality of the genders as a fundamental right but often women are discriminated against at home, their workplace and in the society in general. They don’t even get equal pay for equal work at some places. They single-handedly balance the pressures of domestic and public life.
          </p>
<p>
           In recent decades we have witnessed a series of laws passed for the upliftment of women. These legislations have been brought to give equal rights and privileges to women as men, to eliminate discriminations against women and remove inequality between genders.
          </p>
<p>
           But all these opportunities are wasted if certain stereotypes and biases distort the way women are perceived, often to their disadvantage.

           ‘Ragging, An Evil’
           <br/>
           By: NAVTEJ
          </p>
<p>
           Ragging is a social evil that has been in practice since the British era. It was initiated with the aim to reiterate respect for hierarchy and to misuse authority by enforcing traditions and discipline.
          </p>
<p>
           Now this social evil has spread to educational institutions. It is a damaging form of interaction of the seniors in colleges or schools with their juniors or newcomers. It has become increasingly unpopular due to several complaints of serious injuries to the victims. Due to this severity, strict laws against ragging have been enforced by the Supreme Court. Under the pretext of fun, new students are often assaulted, sometimes stripped and intimidated by their seniors and this torture leaves an indelible impression on their minds. Seeing the vulgar aspect and fatalities of ragging it has been strictly banned in many institutions and this is proving effective. The Supreme Court too has declared ragging as a criminal offence
          </p>
<p>
           Since ragging has degenerated into an unmitigated evil it must go completely, and there can be no argument in favour of this evil practice. Whenever it has raised its ugly head, it has only shown the physical or mental exploitation that new students are subjected to.

<p>
           India’s rich cultural history and heritage and its geographical diversity make its international tourism potential large and varied. Besides its cultural and heritage tourism, India also offers medical, business, educational and sports tourism.
          </p>
<p>
           Indian tourism with its places of worship, places of historical interest, hill-stations, beaches etc. embraces a vast array. For more than 4000 years, India has been regarded as one of the most spiritual places on earth. The Golden Temple at Amritsar, the Konark Sun Temple, Samath etc. attract people from all over the world. The places of historical interest in India like the TaMahal, the Red Fort, Charminar etc. are a great attraction for foreigners. During summers, tourists like to visit the hill stations in India and in winters the sun-kissed beaches are crowded with foreign tourists. Moreover, India is placed among the top three medical tourism destinations in Asia, due to the world-class hospitals, quality and low-cost treatment and highly skilled doctors. Thus, tourism in India has emerged as one of the fastest-growing sectors which have contributed significantly to our county’s economic growth and development.

           <br/>
           By: Navita
          </p>
<p>
           The Midday Meal Scheme, a school meal programme was introduced by the Government of India to improve the nutritional status of school-going children who belong to the deprived sections of the society. This Scheme has attracted many impoverished children to school thus also preventing them from going astray.
          </p>
<p>
           The Midday Meal Scheme, has been a successful nationwide free school lunch program catering to all students. It has helped in boosting school enrolment, ending hunger, aiding the process of socialisation, promoting gender equality by increasing female enrolment and also creating employment opportunities for poor.
          </p>
<p>
           But the Midday Meal Scheme has its drawbacks also. The midday meal tragedy in Bihar which killed 23 children who ate the contaminated cooked food turned the spotlight on the problems affecting this scheme. Lack of monitoring, hygiene and corruption discredits the Midday Meal Scheme. Experts say the scheme suffers from structural problems, the biggest being the lack of a proper monitoring mechanism. Children often get low quality, insufficient and unhygienic food and there is corruption in the delivery system.
          </p>
<p>
           The government has now decided to streamline this scheme and involve parents and local members of the community in its implementation. This will prove to be the most positive step to ensure that the Midday Meal Scheme serves its required purpose.

           By: Navtej
          </p>
<p>
           Morning Assembly is one the most important aspects of a school’s curriculum. It has the potential to nurture a positive school ethos that stresses care for the self and for others. It gives a cool and calm start to the otherwise hectic schedule of the day.
          </p>
<p>
           Morning Assembly prepares students physically, mentally and spiritually for the day.
          </p>
<p>
           A morning assembly includes prayer, songs, speeches and physical exercises all of which energise us to begin the day on an optimistic note.
          </p>
<p>
           Morning assembly has the potential to heighten consciousness by generating a school ethos that is calm, happy and purposeful. It also contributes to developing personal autonomy and contentment. A Morning Assembly is also a means for the whole school to celebrate national festivals together. It gives a chance to students to share stories, experiences and anecdotes etc. At a later stage in our lives, we reflect and celebrate a behaviour that reflects the values we have embedded on a daily basis through our Morning Assembly.
          </p>
<p>
           Morning Assembly’s can become a very positive experience once their influence and impact to both the individual and the school, in general, is truly understood and recognised.

          </p>
<p>
           A twelve-year-old boy in our neighbourhood drives a car and the parents proudly boast of it. Unfortunately, this is not a rare occurrence. In recent years we have seen a rise of underage unlicensed drivers on the road. To address this serious issue we need to first understand the dangers of underage driving. The high number of underage drivers transgressing the law by going for a joyride can be attributed to peer pressure and a general feeling of youthful invincibility. Teenagers have a feeling that they can get away with breaking the law and this gives them a sense of bravado. The hazards of underage driving can result in loss of life or severe physical and emotional scars on the survivors.
          </p>
<p>
           Underage driving should be totally discouraged by parents who must talk to their children about the drastic consequences of this action and the trouble they can get into. The authorities too should take strict action against parents if children break the law. The most effective way to discourage underage driving would be to teach responsibility by setting an example. If parents drive with caution and obey traffic rules their children will also abide the laws of the road.

<p>
           Education of girls has been a high priority with the Government of India. In the new millennium India has consolidated its earlier educational reforms with increased resources and stronger policy commitments for achieving elementary education, particularly for girls. ‘Saroa Shiksha Abhiyan’ or ‘Education For All’ programme recognizes that ensuring the education of the girl child requires changes not only in the education system but also in society’s norms and attitudes. A two-pronged gender strategy has hence been adopted to make the educational system responsive to the needs of the girls through targeted interventions which serve as a pull-factor to enhance access and retention of girls in schools on the one hand and generate a community demand for girls’ education through training and mobilisation on the other hand. The CBSE has also come up with the novel scheme of providing free education from the sixth standard onwards to the single girl child.
          </p>
<p>
           If India wants to rank among the developed nations, it must give foremost priority to female education because if we educate a man, we educate an individual, but if we educate a woman we educate an entire family. If women are educated then problems like female infanticide, dowry, domestic violence, child marriage and other related atrocities will vanish. Education provides the essential criteria to fulfil certain economic, political and cultural functions and improves the socio-economic status of women. At every age and level education enhances the intellectual, social and emotional development of women and enables them to meet their basic needs. Thus most of the problems that our society today faces can be eradicated by educating the girl child.

           <br/>
           To attend coaching classes has become more of a trend which most students follow. This has happened because of the growing competition and the desire among students to excel. They feel that by attending these coaching classes they will be able to improve their grades but unfortunately, it is a waste of their precious time. It makes them tired, affects their health and also their grades. Coaching classes have become synonymous in the lives of city students and students find it hard to cope up with their studies without them. Almost all students who attend coaching classes have lost their time for recreation and physical activities. Students sometimes travel long distances to attend the so-called ‘reputed’ coaching centres thus wasting a lot of time.
          </p>
<p>
           In today’s cut-throat competition the life of students is as it is very stressful and combined with this stress is the extra burden of attending coaching classes. Parents too fail to realise how they are pressurizing the children by making their already hectic work schedule more strenuous by enrolling them in coaching classes. Education is a natural process of learning and should not be forced upon the children. Students who overestimate their stamina join these coaching classes and end up creating a mess of their daily routine.
          </p>
<p>
           Students are running from one place to another for coaching and are unable to realise the value of time and time management. Not only are coaching centres unnecessary but are also adversely affecting the life of students.

<p>
           The teen stage of one’s life is filled with stress and anxiety. This is because it is that stage of our life when we face a host of novel problems and pressures from various quarters.
          </p>
<p>
           To start with teenagers experience many significant physical changes and at times they find it difficult to cope with their bodies that grow and develop rapidly.
          </p>
<p>
           Combined with this is social pressure, peer pressure and parental pressure. Most teenagers feel that academic concerns feature at the top of their list of stress stimulants. Worries about their future, the tension to attain good grades and cut-throat competition cause teenagers to experience inordinate amount of stress.
          </p>
<p>
           The stress that teenagers face today may vary from academic pressure, physical appearances, peer pressure etc. but these issues can be dealt with if parents and guardians understand these problems and approach them in a positive and friendly manner. Proper guidance is vital especially in this very formative phase in the life of children so that they can grow up to be confident and optimistic adults. Finally teenagers need to develop assertive-ness, training skills and learn practical coping skills. They should always feel good about doing a competent job rather than demanding perfection from themselves and others.

           Lack Of Interest In Reading
           <br/>
           By: Rama
          </p>
<p>
           Reading is an essential tool for lifelong learning. It has a vital role to play in overall development. Reading enables us to extend our scope of knowledge and experience.
          </p>
<p>
           But due to technological development the charm of reading has considerably reduced for children. They spend so much time glued to the TV and internet that reading a book in a quiet and peaceful corner of their homes or library has become an archaic idea for most children. This fast declining interest in reading culture among children is a cause of concern and challenge to all and we need to take up measures to alleviate this problem.
          </p>
<p>
           The desire for reading needs to be inculcated among children from a very young age. Parents should read out books to their kids from the time when they are incapable of reading. This way children learn that reading is fun and not a chore. This will also help to promote their attention span which is an important skill for a child to concentrate. To develop the habit of reading in children requires a number of skills that, in most children, has to be formed by direct and informed instruction provided through constant reiteration.

          </p>
<p>
           India is a land of diversity. People of different religions, races and cultures peacefully coexist together. This unity in diversity gives us Indians an opportunity to celebrate a number of festivals thus giving us a sense of joy and pride. These festivals create a sense of cultural unity and brotherhood. Festivals give us a unique opportunity to spend time with our friends and family and also promote communal harmony.
          </p>
<p>
           India is a secular country and so we celebrate many cultural and traditional festivals. Each festival is celebrated differently and uniquely based on certain rituals and beliefs. Some festivals are celebrated by the whole nation and certain festivals are confined to specific regions. But all the festivals are celebrated with great enthusiasm.
          </p>
<p>
           Based on rituals and religions, festivals have been categorized. There are Hindu festivals, the dates of which are fixed on the basis of the Hindu calendar. These include Diwali, Dussehra, Holi, Lohri, Janamasthmi, Raksha Bartdhan to name a few. Then there are festivals celebrated by Muslims. Important among them are Ramzan, Id-Ul-Milad, Bakra- Id, Muharram, etc. The most important festivals celebrated by the Sikhs are the birthdays of their ten Gurus. The Christians celebrate Good Friday, Easter and Christmas. The uniqueness of our country lies in the fact that in spite of diversities we celebrate and enjoy the fervour of numerous festivals which are celebrated with a sense of oneness.

           Rising pollution, fast and competitive lifestyle, lack of nutritious food etc. have caused health woes for a large section of our population.

           Health Care To The Common Man

<p>
           By: Karan
           <br/>
           The incessant rise in the levels of pollution, the fast and competitive lifestyle and lack of nutritious diet has caused numerous health problems to a large section of our population. Earlier providing health care used to be a charitable activity but today it has become so commercialized, a money-spinning business. Though, to a certain extent, commercialization of health care has benefited us greatly. Privatisation of hospitals has enabled to provide better medical facilities and good ambience in hospitals. The unfortunate part however, is that a great number of our population cannot afford these facilities. These health care facilities are way beyond the reach of the common man. 60% of the population is economically weak and cannot afford to pay the expenses of a private hospital. Medical care is a basic necessity and stricter regulations need to be implemented to standardize the health practices and services across government and private hospitals.
          </p>
<p>
           To provide affordable health care to the common man the government should initiate the setting up of more primary health centres. At all these centres medical aid must be made more accessible, more reliable and more affordable. Essential medicines must be made available free of cost at all such centres and the essential medical facilities must also be available to all sections or society.
          </p>
<p>
           Healthcare is the right of every citizen, without having to go through hassles. Though we cannot say healthcare in India is at par for the rich and poor, there is a silver lining above the clouds, with the promise of a healthier tomorrow.

           Question 37.
           <br/>
           India is an emerging economy. We are rich in natural resources. Yet a significant proportion of our people is living below poverty line. One cause of this poverty is our rising population.

           How To Keep A Check On Population
           <br/>
           By: Karan
          </p>
<p>
           Next to China, India is the second largest populated country in the world. For a developing country like India, this population explosion is a curse that is threatening the development of the country and its society.
          </p>
<p>
           An emerging economy, with rapidly escalating population is likely to face a lack in their resources, as the resources available per person are always plummeting, leading to increased poverty, malnutrition and other population related problems. The need of the hour is to keep a check on population. The first step in this direction would be the education of the masses. Their mental outlook needs to be altered. Moreover, increasing the welfare and status of women and girls, increasing awareness of family planning methods, encouraging female empowerment can also play a very major role in controlling population.
          </p>
<p>
           Improved standard of living also acts as a deterrent to large family norm. The communication media like radio, television and newspapers are a good means to propagate the benefits of planned families to the uneducated people in the rural and backward areas of India. The government can give various types of incentives to people who practice family planning. Strict legal action should be taken against child marriage and there should be proper enforcement of laws related to child labour.
          </p>
<p>
           If the population growth in our country is not i kept under check, no amount of progress made by India will make a difference to the poverty that plagues us.

           Question 38.

           <br/>
           By: Karuna
          </p>
<p>
           It is unfortunate that being in the 21st century with so much technological advancement we still have not been able to ensure the safety of women. Numerous cases have been reported and many unreported about the torture and humiliation that women are subjected to. They are in fact the most vulnerable as far as their safety and security is concerned.
          </p>
<p>
           Concerns about safety restrict the mobility and activity of women and leave them with no choice but to strategise everything from timings to travel, how to walk, how to dress or commute. When we talk about women’s safety, the biggest question is how do we keep our mothers, sisters and daughters safe against
          </p>
<p>
           violence outside the house. Women are often stared at, molested and discriminated against. Not only outside the house, they are even discriminated against at the workplace and in their homes.
          </p>
<p>
           We cannot just hold our legal system and the police responsible for the atrocities committed to women. As good citizens, we have a fundamental duty to contribute towards bringing an order to ensure dignity and respect for women so that they too can live with a sense of freedom, pride and confidence. To ensure this is the collective work of our society. A reform in the police system is also needed wherein women police should be deployed in most areas so as to make women feel safe. CCTV cameras should be installed at strategic places and these should be closely monitored. Our legal system also needs reforms wherein stringent punishments that are non-bailable in nature should be given to a person who outrages the modesty of a woman. We also need fast track courts to deal with offences and crimes against women. These can be made responsible to clear the cases on a day-to-day basis with fair trial as its core principle.
          </p>
<p>
           The need of the hour is to take action not by force but by will to make our country more safe and secure for women and bring to reforms whereby women feel more fearless and empowered.

           Question 39.

           Education has always been a noble profession. Our ancestors received their learning at gurukuls and ashrams.

<p>
           Education has always been a noble profession and has always been held in high esteem. Our ancestors received their education in ashrams and gurukuls. Even in the near past pathshalas (schools) were associated with places of worships. But, in the present day, education has become commercialized, a business where lot of money is involved.
          </p>
<p>
           With the advent of a large number of private institutions in the mid nineties, the agenda of education has been hijacked and educational institutes have become a profit-generating business. Schools, coaching centres and educational institutes are prospering. They charge a huge amount of money to impart education and parents too are willing to shell out a lot of money to educate their wards. Even the most reputed educational institutes do not hesitate in taking large donations, which parents give to them without any hassles. Secondly, the state of education in our country today is a cause of concern. Along with rampant commercialization, the quality and standard of education has not improved much. The curriculum in schools and colleges lacks basic communication and problem-solving skills, promotes rote learning, curbs creativity and originality and lays too much emphasis on marks. There is a need for a complete overhauling of the quality of education being imparted in our institutions. Another cause for concern is the dire shortage of schools, colleges and educational infrastructure in our country. The goal of education to harness the potential of a student and to channelize it in the right way has been lost. The need of the hour is for the government and people to work hand in hand and improve these sad state of affairs.

           Question 40.
           <br/>
           According to 2011 census, literacy rate of hundred percent or around has been achieved by only a couple of states in India. Illiteracy is found mostly among the old and deprived sections of society. What can the youth do to spread literacy in society?

           <br/>
           Removing Illiteracy
          </p>
<p>
           Illiteracy is still a major blot on India, after more than sixty years of its achieving independence. To an extent it exemplifies India’s failure to reach out to its masses. The removal of illiteracy has to be tackled on a priority basis and students can play an important role in achieving this goal. Since they are in the process of receiving education themselves they are most appropriate for also putting forth their services to achieve the goal of educating the illiterate masses. Students should be encouraged to carry the lamp of knowledge by organizing events such as, ‘Each One, Teach One’.
          </p>
<p>
           If every student resolves to teach two illiterate persons in a year during his vacations, it will in the long run help to eradicate illiteracy. The government should also render full support to students in terms of infrastructure in their contribution to the Indian Literacy Campaign. Students can also play a vital role in the programme of Adult Literacy. If all our students get together and try to work towards achieving literacy among the masses, then the day is not far when India too will join the league of countries that have attained hundred percent literacy.

<p>
           By: Karan
           <br/>
           Increase in the number of private vehicles in the last two decades has led to an unprecedented rise in air pollution, traffic jams, lack of parking space, road rage, etc. One of the solutions to this problem lies in the use of public transport.
          </p>
<p>
           Use of public transport reduces travel by private vehicles. Public transport is beneficial as it not only eases congestion on roads but also saves fuel, money and energy. When people use public transport they reduce their carbon footprint and conserve energy by eliminating travel that would otherwise have been made in a private vehicle. It also gives people energy efficient choices and reduces overall greenhouse gas emissions without reducing the mobility that is so vital to our nation’s economic growth. To encourage more people to use public transport the authorities need to improve local train and bus services. Funds need to be allocated to make public transport services accessible and more reliable.
          </p>
<p>
           A bus with as few as 7-8 passengers is more fuel efficient than an average single occupant car. The recent odd-even rule for cars started by Chief Minister of Delhi, Mr. Arvind Kejriwal was initiated to encourage the use of public transport and thereby reduce pollution caused by traffic. The authorities are working hard to make public more aware of how useful, efficient and less damaging to the environment the use of public transport is.

           Question 42.
           <br/>
           In certain states of India there is a great imbalance in the male female ratio. This is the result of special treatment given to boys in the family. Why is it so?

           Gender Discrimination In Society
           <br/>
           By: Karuna
          </p>
<p>
           The 2011 census in India has revealed that the gender imbalance is at its highest level in certain states of India. A cultural preference for boys and the increasing availability of prenatal screening to determine an unborn child’s sex have helped contribute to a worsening in the male-female ratio.
          </p>
<p>
           More boys and fewer girls in a population has disastrous effects not only on the social life but also on the economic vibrancy of a country. In India the male in general and the male child, in particular, have privileged position in the patriarchal family tradition. It is the sons who inherit land, carry forward the family name, financially provide for parents in old age and perform rituals for deceased parents. Awareness needs to be created in certain sections of society regarding equality of women. Though Government regulations help to improve the position of women in society, the actual way to change the mindset of people is through education and changing the ways that people think about gender roles. The media must take active part in educating the people about the importance of gender equality. The government must enforce laws protecting women in all spheres of life—be it at the domestic front or at the professional front. More number of men must be recruited in the fight against gender discrimination. When men treat women with respect, the gender equality movement is strengthened.
          </p>

           The girl deficit will create a society that will be much less stable and much more volatile than it would be with a balanced male female ratio.

          </p>
<p>
           Advertisements are considered to be an integral part of business which make people aware of the goods and services available in the market. They promote competition among producers and manufacturers who have to maintain good quality of their goods to ensure their sale. New products are introduced and popularised through advertisements. The consumer saves time due to prior knowledge about the product, its price, its features, etc. Advertising is a very artistic way of communicating with the customers with great communication skills as its main characteristic. Moreover they provide information to the producers or the companies about their competitors and enable them to match the level of their competitors.
          </p>
<p>
           Advertisements help to educate people. Social issues like family planning, child labour, education of

           In most countries, the age of 18 is when you are legally and officially treated as an adult.

I am looking forward to casting my vote in the upcoming elections. I feel a sense of patriotism and responsibility towards my country, more so, as an educated youth. My only concern is that I should be able to use my precious vote fruitfully and choose the most able candidate as our representative. The qualities that I seek in a good leader are that One who can be trusted and is known to live a life of honesty and integrity.

<p>
           True authority is bom from respect for the good character and trustworthiness of the person who leads. A good leader instills confidence and followership by having a clear vision and passion for being truly successful. A leader must be strong and decisive but also humble. An able leader makes sustainable promises and is a person who sticks to his words.

           Technology has taken over every sphere of human life, the most popular being mobile phones which have drastically affected the lives of all people, especially youngsters who feel absolutely lost if they are without their cell phones.
          </p>
<p>
           It has been seen that every technological advancement that provides dramatic benefits has consequential costs and it is this area of mobile phone usage that needs attention, particularly their affect on youngsters. Parents are unable to understand their children’s obsession with their mobile phones. They find the so called ‘mobile culture’ stressful, causing a rift between members of a family. The younger generation has grown up with mobile phones and so are completely addicted to these devices. The worry over the impact of this mobile dependency on the present generation of youngsters is its addiction which makes them couch potatoes and gives them objectionable exposure. Since mobile phone is a safety device we cannot prohibit youngsters from using it but the solution lies in scheduling a fixed time for its usage, parent counselling and checking and diverting the attention of children and youngsters towards other constructive activities.
          </p>
<p>
           The advantages or disadvantages of a mobile phone, like any other device, depends entirely upon its usage. The cell phone is very helpful and convenient and we should ensure its optimal and positive usage.

           Alarming Rise In Road Accidents
           <br/>
           By: Dev
          </p>
<p>
           Road accidents have become the leading cause of death by injury and the tenth leading cause of all deaths globally. In India, the pressure on roads has been on an alarming rise and the lack of road sense has made matters worse.
          </p>
<p>
           Driving licenses are issued on illegal gratifications to some drivers and traffic rules and regulations are rarely adhered to. The lack of tolerance and patience among drivers leads to an increased sense of anger and uncontrolled behaviour especially by the youngsters. Moreover the condition of roads needs to be improved and maintained. They are often full of potholes and their condition worsens during the rainy season.
           <br/>
           To prevent these accidents, it is imperative that effective long and short-term measures are effectively adopted. The traffic police needs to be more active and strict to ensure proper implementation of rules. Higher fines should be imposed and license of repeated offenders should be confiscated. There should be an effective check on the speed limit of vehicles.
          </p>
<p>
           To minimise the number of road accidents proper awareness needs to be created among the masses regarding road safety alongwith importance of observation of traffic rules.

           Question 47.
           <br/>
           Parents keep on saving money to be spent on the weddings of their children. This money could have been spent, instead on their education. Write an article in 150-200 words on ‘Importance of simple weddings’. You are Anu/Anurag. (Comptt. All India 2016)

           Importance Of Simple Weddings
           <br/>
           By: Anu
          </p>
<p>
           It is the responsibility of every parent to give a decent upbringing and education to their child. But unfortunately, there are still some parents who compromise on their child’s education, especially if their child is a girl, and instead save money to be spent on her wedding.
          </p>
<p>
           The basic social structure in our country is such where the marriage of a girl is more important than her education. It is a rather costly affair and the parents spend all their life-savings for this grand and extravagant event. They do not want to compromise on the expenditure of their daughter’s marriage so they end up compromising on her education instead. Many a time parents want their daughters to get a good education with the sole purpose of enhancing her matrimonial prospects.
          </p>
<p>
           The need of the time is to give a girl’s education topmost priority. The concept of simple marriage should be promoted. The money spent on a girl’s education is actually an investment. Let us remember marriage is an important but not the ultimate purpose of a girl’s life. It is only a part of it and a choice some girls probably do not wish to make. So a girl should be given good education, good morals and she must be encouraged to pursue her passions.
          </p>
<p>
           After all, a parent’s main concern is the welfare of their daughter, so they should make a start by placing the control of her future in her own hands by giving her a good education.

<p>
           Physical Education Teacher Modern life can be quite stressful and taxing and therefore it is most important to live a healthy life which we can lead only through a disciplined routine and regular exercise. The health benefits of physical activity and exercise are hard to ignore.
          </p>
<p>
           Exercise keeps one active, alert and also sharpens one’s memory. It enables one to develop a positive attitude, increases productivity and gives long life. Morning walk, Yoga, aerobics and other exercises help us to lead a healthy life. Moreover, regular physical exercise improves one’s muscle strength and boosts endurance. Exercise and physical activity deliver oxygen and vital nutrients to our tissues and help our cardiovascular system work more efficiently.
          </p>
<p>
           Exercise and physical activity can also be a fun way to spend time. It gives us a chance to unwind, enjoy the outdoors or simply engage in activities that make us happy. As a general rule, aim for at least thirty minutes of physical exercise every day. Exercise is the miracle cure we have always had but sometimes, probably for too long, we neglect to take our recommended dose.
          </p>
<p>
           People of all ages need to exercise and reduce their sedentary lifestyle which means we all need to think about increasing the types of physical activities that can easily be included in our daily routine.

           Question 49.
           <br/>
           Life in cities is not as safe as it used to be. People feel more at risk today.

           How To Ensure Safe Life In Cities
           <br/>
           By: Aman
          </p>
<p>
           Living in a city enables people to advance socially and economically. However many challenges exist for people living in cities. One of the main challenges is the question of the safety of city dwellers.
          </p>
<p>
           Crimes like kidnapping, murder, rape, robberies, chain-snatching and crimes against women and senior citizens are most common. The reasons for these can be attributed to unemployment, illiteracy, greed and the desire to maintain high status by acquiring easy money. We cannot always hold our legal system and the police responsible for the rise of crime rate in cities. It is the duty of each one of us to be vigilant at all times and to ensure our safety.
          </p>
<p>
           The police certainly need to be more active and vigilant. Offenders need to be punished most stringently so as to deter others about the repercussions in case they commit the same crime. Parents need to inculcate moral values in their children from a very young age so that they grow up clearly understanding the difference between right and wrong. The government should generate more employment opportunities to ensure that the number of unemployed youngsters in our country does not rise.
          </p>
<p>
           It is definitely the collective responsibility of our government, the police department and each one of us to strive for a safe and secure city.

           Rural Health
           <br/>
           By: Karuna
          </p>
<p>
           Rural health care is one of the biggest challenges facing the Health Ministry of India. With more than seventy per cent of our population living in rural areas and the low level of health facilities, mortality rates due to diseases are on a high. So, rural life is healthy is more of a myth.
          </p>
<p>
           Healthcare is the right of every individual but lack of quality infrastructure, dearth of qualified medical functionaries and non-accessibility to basic medicines and medical aid thwarts its reach to more than sixty per cent of population that lives in rural India. Basic amenities like clean drinking water, a proper sewage and drainage system and the facility of toilets is still not available to our major rural population.
          </p>
<p>
           Several organisations are working alongwith the government and NGOs to improve the rural health system in India. People living in rural areas need to be made aware of the importance of cleanliness and sanitation. Regular health check camps should be set-up at primary health centres in rural areas. Health- Melas should be organised to spread health awareness among the masses.
          </p>
<p>
           Growth in national income is not enough by itself if its benefits do not manifest themselves in the form of better health facilities for all.

           Question 51.
           <br/>
           Our performance in Rio Olympics has told us that we do not pay enough attention to ! athletics and outdoor games. It is time we revised our attitude.

<p>
           Our country’s performance in the Rio Olympics is enough proof that athletics and outdoor games are not given due importance and neglected completely by our government, schools, colleges and by one and all. It is high time we revise our attitude and make sports an important part of our school and college curriculum.
          </p>
<p>
           It has been argued that sports should be made compulsory right from the primary classes and should be made an integral part of school education. Besides providing a basis for physical fitness, sports and outdoor games inculcate a spirit of competition and impart a sense of discipline and togetherness in us. Outdoor games also enable us to become more daring and adventurous. We always think of a healthy mind in a healthy body.
          </p>
<p>
           Both physical and mental well being are the essential prerequisites for great achievement in our life. Thus, it is actually high time we make the required efforts to spot our sports talents when they are young and provide them with all the necessary facilities and infrastructure to hone their talent. They need to be trained from a very young age to enable them to compete confidently with world champions.

           Every teenager has a dream to achieve something in life. Any person without an aim or dream drifts aimlessly and can never achieve success. Aimless life is like a rudderless ship which leads us nowhere.
          </p>

           I too have a dream that I will work very hard to fulfil. I want to be a pilot. I have spent most of my childhood reading aviation history which
           <br/>
           has always fascinated me. Moreover, as a pilot I can lead an adventurous life and also get an opportunity to face various types of challenges. An action-oriented and challenging career has always been my passion. My first conscious entry into a plane was probably at the age of six or seven years. I can still recall how awestruck I was at the idea that the plane was actually going to fly with so many people on board and thought that the person who was going to fly the plane was probably a demi-God. I was really fascinated by this person who I got to know was called the ‘pilot’ and somehow the idea of flying a plane got stuck in my mind since that tender age.

<p>
           To have a fair complexion is an obsession in our society, more so where the female gender is concerned. Demand for fair brides in matrimonial columns and the sale of fairness creams are evidence enough how obsessed our society is with fair complexion.
          </p>
<p>
           Though the people of our country blindly ape the western culture, but in this respect they are not like people in the West who like to be tanned. Let us not forget that fair complexion is only skin deep and a beautiful person is one who has a beautiful mind. All the development and progress that we are so proud of in the 21st century has not been able to remove the shackles of medieval mindset. It is actually our behaviour in society that determines the kind of person we are. It is high time we revaluate what we consider beautiful and thus assess the unrealistic expectations and pressures that are unnecessarily put on females to be superficially beautiful.
          </p>
<p>
           Making technological progress is an achievement but our real advancement would be when we get rid of this racist mindset within our society. Unfortunately we still have a long way to go to achieve that.

           India is a vast country, with a rich and varied i heritage, linguistic and cultural diversity and I therefore its tourist potential is equally vast. ; Promoting tourism will also play a vital role in the development of our country as it is an important source of earning foreign exchange. Tourism has become a thriving global industry with the power to have a positive impact on the developing countries. It is the largest service industry in India, so the Ministry of Tourism, the nodal agency for developing and promoting tourism in India runs and maintains the “Incredible India” campaign.
          </p>
<p>
           India is a large country with a rich cultural heritage and so it has the potential to provide ; great geographical and cultural diversity to ! tourists. In spite of this the number of tourists ; visiting India is decreasing rapidly every year. I It’s always easy to have discussions on what ; the tourism industry should do and what it is ; not doing. Cleanliness, hygiene and safety are factors most tourists thrive upon and in this sector our country’s progress lags behind, mainly because there are no stringent laws that i are effectively implemented. Indian tourism ; industry has been hit by pollution. Resolving these issues by imposing heavy fines on the ! polluters, enforcing consumer laws, ensuring ! security of tourists, especially females and providing decent and hygienic accommodation I will go a long way in promoting tourism and thereby salvaging the much needed foreign exchange for our country.
          </p>
<p>
           Also the tourist infrastructure in India should I be strengthened. Airports and railway stations should provide accurate and reliable information to foreign tourists about tourist destinations, hotels, taxis, etc. Government-owned hotels should be managed properly. The Government should take steps to restore the splendour of the ancient monuments and also take appropriate steps for the upkeep and maintenance of the various tourist destinations. Although the tourism industry has initiated many improvements lately, we still have a long way to go so as to ensure tourism alone is able to generate significant revenue for the country.

           By: Ram
          </p>
<p>
           The famous saying, ‘Slow and steady wins the race’ emphasizes the problems one is likely to face due to unnecessary hurry. This hastiness is the cause of stress that hurts children and adults alike and is crippling our society in many ways, even causing death.
          </p>
<p>
           A person who is consistent and steady in his approach can achieve success even if he is slow because his steps are measured, like the tortoise in the famous ‘tortoise and hare story’ in which the tortoise won the race because of his tireless efforts. But the concept of life being a race is flawed, because as soon as one thinks of it in such terms he gets into an excited state of agitation. Our life is not a race which can be won through our hastiness. It is a fascinating journey wherein measured steps and a systematic approach can enable us to achieve our goals.
          </p>
<p>
           Success is very much an achievable target if we view things with confidence; without giving up when things do not seem to fall in place and being patient when it is taking time to reach our expected destination. We may often come across a person who, despite his exceptional talent fails, while another person with ordinary merit succeeds. The difference lies in the way these two people have worked. The one who worked hastily failed and the one who worked steadily and consistently became successful. When we are in an unnecessary hurry, our chances for making mistakes and errors increase because in our hastiness we may have to compromise on the quality of work. Let us always remember there is no shortcut for success and there is no alternative for hard work.

          </p>
<p>
           India has a rich and varied heritage with linguistic and cultural diversity. So to live in peace and harmony it is essential to be united despite the differences in our culture, caste or religion. We need to stay joined by only one faith and that is a brotherhood.
          </p>
<p>
           The good thing about our country and its culture is that it is tolerant and absorbing. The ! democratic set-up facilitates the process of promoting unity. The diversity in every religion or culture should therefore serve as a source of strength. We need to be proud of our cultural distinctiveness. Though our religions are different, their basic teachings are the same, belief in the theory of Dharma and Karma.
          </p>
<p>
           To promote unity in our diverse country we need to think beyond petty interests and must . work for broader goals to bring about prosperity and progress in our society. Our social and cultural differences should not be looked upon as conflicts but as varieties that enrich our society and our nation as a whole. We celebrate various festivals with a sense of unity, especially in schools and colleges. We display a great sense of unity when there is a foreign invasion challenge. The social customs and traditions which all Indians observe, irrespective of their caste and religion in different parts of our country, bring a sense of unity which keeps alive the message of being united despite our diversity.

           By: Rajani
          </p>
<p>
           ‘Health is Wealth’, is an old saying which aptly sums up the importance of maintaining good health. If we are healthy we are physically and mentally contented as we are away from medical conditions like hypertension, diabetes, heart ailments etc.
          </p>
<p>
           In the past decade there has been an unprecedented rise in the growing problem of obesity in children, which is leading to type II diabetes. Children especially in the cities, binge on junk food or overeat, have sugar-sweetened beverages and include very few fruits and vegetables in their normal diet. As a result they become overweight and obese and make themselves vulnerable to lifestyle diseases like high blood pressure and type II diabetes.
           <br/>
           It is imperative to ensure that children maintain a healthy lifestyle through right food and good eating habits. They should be encouraged to eat foods that provide adequate nutrition and provide an appropriate number of calories. Parents should look for ways to make their favourite dishes healthier and ensure that their children eat calorie-rich food in moderation. Children should be encouraged to adopt an active lifestyle where they engage in some sort of physical activity daily. It is recommended to focus on small but permanent changes in the children’s eating pattern than a series of short-term changes which cannot be sustained for long. To effectively address the complex problem of childhood obesity a sustained effort to promote a healthy lifestyle needs to be followed by parents and these strategies need to be initiated in children at a very early stage.

           Every student faces the question of ‘What Next?’ after clearing his Senior School Examination. During this phase most students face a great deal of stress and at this time counselling regarding the choice of course can prove to be of valuable help to them.
          </p>
<p>
           Many students face a dilemma while choosing a course because the only career guidance they have is the opinion of their parents, the teacher’s judgement and their friends’ comments. These factors are certainly not sufficient for a child to base the foundation of his entire life and career. Professional counselling involves scientifically developed aptitude and personality tests that enable the counsellor to give the best-suited advice to students to choose the course that best suits their ability. Human capabilities are numerous and cannot be measured but every person has some unique traits.
          </p>
<p>
           Based on their strengths, one of the keys that helps to identify these i qualities is through the medium of counselling. Counselling sessions help the students to understand the pros and cons of the different streams and the career paths they offer, so students can make an informed choice and get a correct course assessment that enables them to avoid risk of career path change later in their life. Counselling thus provides the essential morale-boost to students by building their level of motivation that is very essential for longterm success and improves their overall performance.

           Question 59.
           <br/>
           You are Raip/Rajani, a social activist. You feel that in spite of all the hue and cry over the protection of women in society are harassed on the road and even at home.

           Women Must Be Given Honour
           <br/>
           By: Ram, Social Activist
          </p>
<p>
           Women constitute almost half of the world’s population and are equal stakeholders of society. But unfortunately, even now, in the 21st century, violence against women is rampant and their unnecessary harassment continues despite the hue and cry of there being more laws to ensure their protection.
          </p>
<p>
           It is a bitter reality that, every year, thousands of women become victims of violence in their homes and are harassed on the roads and sometimes these incidents devastate their lives forever. These unfortunate incidents affect the physical as well as mental health of the victim. It is very important to take up concrete efforts and introduce stem laws to ensure how violence and harassment against women can be avoided and how they can get their due honour in society.
          </p>
<p>
           We cannot just hold our legal system and the police responsible for the atrocities committed to women. As good citizens, we have a fundamental duty to contribute towards bringing an order to ensure dignity and respect for women so that they too can live with a sense of freedom, pride and confidence. To ensure this is the collective work of our society. We have to develop basic morality and nurture a value system that teaches respect for women, especially among young boys and men.
          </p>
<p>
           A reform in the police system is also needed wherein women police should be deployed in most areas so as to make women feel safe. CCTV cameras should be installed at strategic places and these should be closely monitored. Our legal system also needs reforms wherein stringent punishments that are non-bailable in nature should be given to a person who outrages the modesty of a woman. We also need fast track courts to deal with offences and crimes against women.
          </p>
<p>
           The need of the hour is to take action not by force but by will to make our country safe and secure for women and bring in reforms where-by women feel more fearless and empowered.

           You are Ram/Rajani. Write an article in 150200 words on ‘Importance of Newspaper in our Life’. (Comptt. All India 2016)

           Importance Of Newspapers In Our Life
           <br/>
           By: Rajani
          </p>
<p>
           Newspapers are the oldest and most reliable source of news and information. The electronic media is at times unreliable, gives inadequate information and is not always available. Newspapers are not only most easily available but they are also the cheapest. Moreover newspapers are very important for students for a good exposure to English language and enhancement of their vocabulary through the “Editorial Column”. Newspapers are written with honesty and sincerity unlike the electronic media which sensationalizes news to increase TRPs and sometimes misleads public.
          </p>
<p>
           Though news conveyed by TV news channels is quicker and faster, these, many a time, tend to omit facts and details about an incident and sometimes even sensationalize news without a reason. Here the newspaper comes in handy as it gives not only vital details but also contains more reliable news. Besides, the newspaper is easy to carry and can be read at any time. Further, the permanence of the printed word helps in refreshing one’s memory about certain facts and incidents reported in the past. Newspapers also contain many columns dedicated to advertisements like vacant situations, buying or selling of goods, information about missing persons, obituary news, etc. All this and much more information is contained only in the newspaper. Newspapers have been and will remain the mouthpiece of the nation and the unseen advisers of the common people.

           Question 61.
           <br/>
           You are Ram/Rajani, a social worker. The banning of liquor shops is being taken up in many states. You welcome the move. Write an article in 150-200 words supporting the move, highlighting how it will promote the society’s standard of living, health, economy etc. and appreciating the governments that are ready to forego the revenue that comes out of it. (Comptt. All India 2016)
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
           Banning Of Liquor Shops
           <br/>
           By: Rajani
          </p>
<p>
           Many states have taken up the welcome move of banning liquor shops. These states include Gujarat, Bihar, Nagaland and Manipur and the Union Territory of Lakshadweep. This move is most positive and will help to promote the physical and mental well-being of society in general.
          </p>
<p>
           Binge drinking and continued alcohol consumption cause many health problems. Moreover, it decreases the productivity of an individual, increases family problems and is also one of the major causes of broken relationships. People who drink heavily are most likely to develop a physical and emotional dependency on alcohol. With so many negative effects associated with its consumption, there is no reason why one should not appreciate the government’s move of banning liquor shops.
          </p>
<p>
           It is also a matter of appreciation that the governments are ready to forego a large amount of revenue that they gain by selling liquor, only because it impacts negatively on society. The Government of these states have imposed complete ban for a social cause to create an alcohol-free environment. Through this ban the governments hope to improve society’s standard of living. When alcohol is not available and there is no way it can be bought the money one wastes on it is saved and can be utilised productively elsewhere.
          </p>
<p>
           So there is no doubt about the fact that this bold and welcome move taken by the government should be appreciated and applauded.
