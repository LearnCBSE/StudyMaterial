            1. Do you think the love for one’s country among people of different countries leads to wars ?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            A.
           </strong>
           “One of the largest temptations of any country is sliding from patriotism to nationalism.”
           <br/>
           A patriot is somebody who loves his country. Therefore the country of this patriot is by definition the best of the world. Therefore the other countries must be worst.
           <br/>
           As the other countries’ patriots do think that their countries are the best in the world also, there is an insoluble misunderstanding which usually finishes into war.

<strong>
            A. The difference between the position of the President of India and the British King:
           </strong>
<br/>
           Under the Draft Constitution the President occupies the same position as the King under the English Constitution. He is the head of the state but not of the Executive. He represents the nation but dobs not rule the nation. He is the symbol of the nation. His place in the administration is that of a ceremonial device or a seal by which the nation’s decisions are made known.

            15. Imperialism created much stress often leading to wars – Explain.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            A.
           </strong>
           As industrial capital developed in the European countries like Britain, Germany and US, they needed Markets for their products and access to raw materials. As capital further accumulated in Banks and financial institutions, they looked for safe investment opportunities in colonies. Thus by the end of the 19th century there was a race for colonies between the European powers. The governments of these countries acted on behalf of their capitalists to increase their areas of influence and reduce the area under their competitors. As new industrial powers (like Japan, Germany and Italy) emerged they wanted to re-divide the colonies but the old powers were not ready for this. This created much stress often leading to wars.

<strong>
            A.
           </strong>
           a) 1) Germany was indeed, especially hard-hit by the Great Depression. The major factor was the Treaty of Versailles.
           <br/>
           2) Payments made by Germany to the victorious allies represented a drain of capital.
           <br/>
           3) The international trade was triggered by the passage of the Smooth-Hawley Tariff Act in the United States in 1930.
           <br/>
           4) Germany engaged in a tremendous hyper inflation of its currency and it wiped out the people’s savings.
           <br/>
           5) Workers lost their jobs or were paid reduced wages. Business was in crisis.
           <br/>

           <br/>

            17. Why did the Japanese allow Bose to recruit soldiers whom they had imprisoned ?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            A.
           </strong>
           Japan and Southeast Asia were major refuges for Indian nationalists living in exile before the start of World War – II. Japan has sent intelligence mission to gain support from the Indian movement. These missions were successful in establishing contacts with Indian nationalists in exile supporting the establishment and organisation of the Indian Independence league.
           <br/>
           At the outbreak of World War – II, in Southeast Asia, 70,000 Indian troups were stationed in Malaya and later imprisoned by Japan after the fall of Malaysia and Singapore. From these prisoners of war, the first Indian National Army was formed and received considerable Japanese aid and support. In 1943 the Japanese invited Bose to lead the Indian Nationalist Movement in East Asia. Bose accepted and reached Japan and took the lead.

            18. After the overthrow of monarchy, China had two different types of regimes. How were they similar or different ?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            A.
           </strong>
           1) The monorchial Manchu empire was overthrown and a republic was established in 1911.
           <br/>
           2) Even though the Manchu dynasty was overthrown and a republic was declared, the republican government led by Sun-Yat-Sen could not consolidate itself.
           <br/>
           3) The country came to be controlled by regional military powers called ‘warlords’.
           <br/>
           4) The social and political situation continued to be unstable.
           <br/>
           5) There was a movement called ‘The May Fourth Movement.’ It galvanised a whole generation to attack old tradition and to call for saving China through modern science, democracy and nationalism.
           <br/>
           Thus, both the regimes were similar.
