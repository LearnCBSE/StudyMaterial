            Answer:

</strong>
           Rashtrakutas became powerful in the following manner:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Rashtrakutas were subordinates to the Chalukyas of Karnataka.
           </li>
<li>
            In the mid-eighth century Dantidurga, a Rashtrakuta chief, overthrew his Chalukyan overlord.
           </li>
<li>
            He performed a ritual called Hiranya-garbha with the help of Brahmanas.
           </li>
<li>
            This ritual was, then, considered to lead the rebirth of the sacrificer as Kshatriya, even if he was not Kshatriya by birth.

            Answer:
           </strong>
           The new dynasties gained power and wealth. Thereafter they declared themselves to be maha-samantas or mahamandaleshwara. Many of such kings adopted high sounding titles like maharaja-adhiraja or tribhuvana-chakravartin. They also deputed learned brahmanas to depict them as valiant, victorious warriors. Their activities were recorded in Prashastis. They tried to demonstrate their power and resources by building large temples.

            7. What kind of irrigation works were developed in the Tamil Nadu?
            <br/>
            Answer:
            <br/>
</strong>
           Large scale cultivation was developed in Tamil Nadu and in many cases artificial irrigation became necessary. A variety of methods were used:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Wells were dug
           </li>
<li>
            Huge tanks were constructed to collect rainwater
           </li>
<li>
            Canals were constructed
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           All this work required planning, organizing labour and resources. Decisions were taken collectively on the usage of water. New rulers and people took an active interest in these activities.
          </p>

            Answer:

</strong>
           Splendid temples and bronze sculptures of the Cholas:
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<ol>
<li>
            Rajaraja and Rajendra built big temples of Thanjavur and Gangaikondacholapuram.
           </li>
<li>
            They are architectural and sculptural marvels.
           </li>
<li>
            Chola temples often became the centre of settlements around them.
           </li>
<li>
            These were centres of craft production.
           </li>
<li>
            Temples were also endowed with land by both rulers and others.
           </li>
<li>
            The produce of this land went to maintain all the specialists who worked at the temple and very often lived near it.
           </li>
<li>
            They included priests, garland makers, cooks, sweepers, musicians, dancers, etc.
           </li>
<li>
            In other words, temples were not only places of worship; but also the hub of economic, social and cultural life.
           </li>
<li>
            Amongst the crafts associated with temples, the making of bronze images was the most important.
           </li>
<li>
            Chola bronze images are amongst the finest in the world.
           </li>
<li>
            Most images were of deities, sometimes images were made of devotees also.
           </li>

            9. Look at Map 1 once more and find out whether there were any kingdoms in the state in which you live.

<strong>
            10. Contrast the ‘elections’ in Uttaramerur with present day panchayat election?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           The system of election in Uttaramerur was quite different from that of the present day panchayat elections. In the Uttaramerur election, the names of the persons eligible to be members of the committees were written on small tickets of palm leaves. The tickets were put into an earthenware pot. Thereafter a young boy was asked to take out the tickets, one by one for each committee. But the present day panchayat members are elected through a general election.
          </p>
<p>
           The names of the total members are printed with a symbol allotted to them on a paper called ballot paper. The voter put a stamp over their choice and drops it in a ballot box. Votes are counted and the winners’ name is declared by the Returning Officer. Every procedure is organized by a statutory body.
          </p>

<strong>

<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           During the seventh century a new class of rulers emerged. They were the subordinates or samantas under the influence of big landlords or warriors. Later they themselves gained power and wealth and declared themselves to be maha- samantas, maha-mandaleshvara (the great lord of a circle or region)

<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Dantidurga was a Rashtrakuta chief in Deccan. Initially, Rashtrakutas were subordinate to the Chalukyas of Karnataka. Dantidurga, in the mid-eighth century, overthrew his Chalukya overlord and performed a ritual known as ‘hiranya-garbha’. It was thought to lead to the rebirth of the sacrificer as a kshatriya, even if he was not one by birth.

            Answer:
           </strong>
           These states were closely associated with peasants, traders, and Brahmanas. The resources were obtained from peasants, cattle-keepers, and artisans who were the producers. They were compelled to surrender part of what they produced. The traders had to pay revenue. The functionaries for collecting revenue were generally from influential families or from the close relatives of the kings.

           Prashastis, often written by learned Brahmanas, were details of the functioning of a king. They may not be literally true.

<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           It was the trend to demonstrate power and resources by building large temples. The rulers often invested a lot in the decoration and maintenance of the temples. So the foreign conquerors made them target first. The most prominent example of it was the temple 6f Somnath in Gujarat looted several times by Sultan Mahmud of Ghazani who came from Afghanistan. Much of the wealth he carried away was used to create a splendid capital city at Ghazani.

            Answer:
           </strong>
           Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni was a ruler of Afghanistan from 997 to 1030. He was an ambitious king and so made all efforts to extend his control over far off regions. He extended his control over parts of Central Asia, Iran, and the north­western part of the subcontinent. Almost every year he raided the subcontinent targeting wealthy temples. The temple of Somnath in Gujarat was the worst victim of his raids. Much of the wealth he carried away was used to create a splendid capital city at Ghazni. Ghazni was fond of knowing more about the people he conquered. He entrusted a scholar named al-Biruni to write an account of the subcontinent. The al- Biruni’s account, an Arabic work titled as Kitab al-Hind, is still an important source for historians.

<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Cholas belonged to a minor chiefly family known as Muttaraiyar that held power in the Kaveri delta. They worked as subordinate to the Pallava kings of Kanchipuram. Vijayalaya, a member of the ancient chiefly family of the Cholas from Uraiyur, captured the delta from the Muttaraiyar in the middle of the ninth century. ‘Hie town of Thanjavur and the temple for goddess Nishmbhasudini are some of his great creations. Vijayalaya’s successors conquered neighboring regions and the kingdom grew in size and power.

           The Pandyan and the Pallava territories to the south and north were made part of this kingdom.Rajaraja I was the most powerful Chola ruler. He became king in 985 and expanded control over most of these areas. He was well known for the reorganization of the administration of his empire. His son Rajendra I continued his policies an even raided the Ganga valley, Sri Lanka and contries of Southeast Asia, developing a navy for these expeditions. The big temples of Thanjavur and Gangaikonda-cholapuram built by them are architectural marvels.
