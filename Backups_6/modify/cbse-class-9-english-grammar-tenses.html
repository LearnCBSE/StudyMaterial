             1. Time and Tense
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Time is universally divided into past, present, and future. Tense is a form of the verb that expresses time. For example, “she goes’ is the present tense and ‘she went’ is the past tense of the verb ‘to go’. Thus the verb changes its form to show whether an action takes place in the present or it took place in the past.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
<span style="color: #0000ff;">
             2. Tenses
             <br/>
</span>
</strong>
           There are two tenses in English—the simple present and the simple past.
           <br/>
<strong>
            Note.
           </strong>
           Remember that there is no future tense in English to express future time. We use the modal auxiliaries shall and will in the present simple tense, etc, to express future time.
          </p>

             <br/>
</strong>
</span>
           There are two aspects in English—the progressive (continuous) and the perfect. The progressive aspect shows that an action is still in progress, while the perfect aspect shows that the work is complete.

<ul>
<li>
            Thus we have seen that the simple present tense is formed by using the plain infinitive. But -s or -es are added to the bare infinitive (i.e. infinitive without ‘to’) for the third person singular (He, She) and singular noun (Nitu).
           </li>
<li>
            We form the negative sentences by using doesn’t or don’t before the main verb.
           </li>
<li>
            The interrogative sentences are formed by using do or does before the subject.
           </li>
<li>
            The negative interrogative sentences are formed by using do or does before the subject and not after the subject.
            <br/>
            But the short forms don’t and doesn’t come before the subject.

<strong>
            (i)

<ul>

<p>
<strong>
            (ii)

           The negative is formed by putting not after the auxiliary:

<li>
            She is not singing, (isn’t)
           </li>

           </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>

</ul>
<p>
<strong>
            (iv)
           </strong>
           The negative interrogative is formed by placing the auxiliary verbs before the subject and by placing not after the subject:

<p>
<strong>
            Note:

           The negative interrogative form of ‘/ am’ is Am I not? But the contracted form is: Ain’t I?
