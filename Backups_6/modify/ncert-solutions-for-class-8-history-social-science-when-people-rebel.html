          </p>
<p>
           People of the towns and villages rose up in rebellion and rallied around local leaders, zamindars and chiefs.

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Find out more about Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi. In what ways would she have been an unusual woman for her times?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Rani of Jhansi: Rani Lakshmibai was the bravest among all the leaders of 1857 who tried to defeat the British forces. After the death of her husband she had adopted a son but the then Governor-General, Lord Dalhousie refused to give the rule of Jhansi to the adopted child, and Jhansi was annexed to the British Empire.
          </p>
<p>
           When the revolt started against the British, Rani Lakshmibai also participated in it and fought very bravely. Her bravery would always continue to inspire the Indians. With the help of her commanders Nana Sahib, Tantia Tope, and her Afghan supporters, she occupied Gwalior. Hearing about her bravery, the army of Scindia deserted their Maharaja and joined Rani of Jhansi. In the end, she was defeated by the British and died fighting bravely against the British.
          </p>
<p>
           She might be called an unusual woman of her times because of the following reasons:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            She became a widow at the age of 15 years but she did not lose heart.
           </li>
<li>
            She did not accept the British atrocities and challenged them.
           </li>
<li>
            She ruled Jhansi very bravely and efficiently after her husband’s death.
           </li>
</ul>

           <br/>

<ol>
<li>
            First of all the name of the Mughal king was removed from the coins minted by the Company.

            In 1849, Governor-General Dalhousie announced that after the death of Bahadur Shah Zafar, the family of the king would be shifted out of the Red Fort and given another place in Delhi to live in.

           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Why were the Indian sepoys in the employ of the Company discontented? Give sufficient reasons.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Reasons for their discontentment:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            The Indian sepoys were given poor salaries and allowances.
           </li>
<li>
            The conditions of service also made them unhappy.
           </li>
<li>
            Some of the new rules even violated their religious sentiments and beliefs.
           </li>
<li>
            Those were the days when many people in the country believed that if they crossed the sea they would lose their religion and caste.
           </li>
<li>
            So when in 1824 the sepoys were told to go to Burma by the sea route to fight for the Company, they refused to follow this order.
           </li>
<li>
            As a result they were given severe punishment. What is more, in 1856, the Company passed a new law which stated that every new person who took up employment in the Company’s army had to agree to serve overseas if required.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           What reforms did the British introduce in the Indian society? How did the people of India respond to them?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The British introduced several reforms:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            They passed laws to stop the practice of sati and to encourage the remarriage of widows.
           </li>
<li>
            They promoted English language education.
           </li>
<li>
            In 1850, the Company passed a new law that made the conversion to Christianity easier.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Many Indians began to feel that the British were destroying their religion, their social customs and their traditional way of life. But at the same time there were other Indians who readily accepted the reforms introduced by the British. In fact, they wanted to change existing social practices.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Why did the chiefs and rulers support the Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar in the revolt?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Mughal dynasty had ruled over a large part of the country. Most smaller rulers and chieftains controlled different territories on behalf of the Mughal ruler. Threatened by the expansion of British rule, many of them felt that if the Mughal emperor could rule again, they too would be able to rule their own territories once more, under the Mughal authority.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 6.
           <br/>
           How did the British try to win back the loyalty of the people after they recaptured Delhi?
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            The British announced rewards for loyal landholders by allowing them to continue to enjoy traditional rights over their lands.
           </li>
<li>
            Those who had rebelled were told that if they submitted to the British and if they had not killed any white people, they would remain safe and their rights and claims to land would not be denied.

<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           How did other Indian soldiers in Meerut participate in the Revolt of 1857? How did the regiments stationed in Delhi respond when they came to know about the arrival of the Meerut sepoys in the city?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The other Indian soldiers in Meerut participated in the uprising wholeheartedly. On 10 May, 1857 they marched to the jail in Meerut and released the sepoys who were sentenced to ten years’ jail for disobeying their officers. They attacked and killed British officers. They captured guns and ammunition and set fire to the buildings and properties of the British and declared war on the firangis. The soldiers were determined to bring an end to the British rule in the country.
          </p>
<p>
           The sepoys of Meerut rushgd to Delhi in the early hours on 11 May. As news of their arrival spread, the regiments stationed in Delhi also rose up in rebellion. Again British officers were killed, arms and ammunition were seized, buildings were set on fire. Triumphant soldiers gathered around the walls of the Red Fort where the Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar lived, demanding to meet him.
          </p>
<p>
           The emperor was not willing to challenge the mighty British power but the soldiers persisted. They forced their way into the palace and proclaimed Bahadur Shah Zafar as their leaders. The emperor finally accepted this demand. After getting the leader, the soldiers began to plan for further action.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           How did the rebellion spread to other regions of the country?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The position of the British became very weak in Delhi and they were almost defeated by the rebel force. Therefore, there was no uprising for almost a week. Afterwards a spurt of mutinies began in several parts of India. Regiment after regiment mutinied and took to join otlter troops at nodal points like Delhi, Kanpur and Lucknow. After them, the people of the towns and villages also” rose up in rebellion. They rallied around local leaders, zamindars and chiefs who were prepared to establish their authority and fight the British.
          </p>
<p>
           Nana Saheb, the adopted son of the late Peshwa Baji Rao who lived near Kanpur, gathered armed forces and expelled the British Garrison from the city. He proclaimed himself Peshwa. He delcared that he was a Governor under emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar. In Lucknow, Birjis Qadr, the son of the deposed Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, was proclaimed the new Nawab. He too acknowledged the suzerainty of Bahadur Shah Zafar.
          </p>
<p>
           In Jhansi, Rani Lakshmibai joined the rebel sepoys and fought the British along with Tantia Tope, the General of Nana Saheb.
           <br/>
           A situation of widespread rebellion also developed in the region of Awadh. Many new leaders also came up and joined the revolt. Ahmadullah Shah, a maulvi from Faizabad, raised a large force of supporters. He came to Lucknow to fight the British.
           <br/>
           In Delhi, a large number of religious warriors came together to wipe out the white people. Bakht Khan, a soldier from Bareilly, took charge of a large force of fighters who came to Delhi. In Bihar, an old zamindar, Kunwar Singh, joined the rebel sepoys and battled with the British for several months.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           How did the Company suppress the revolt?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Company did not get nervous to sea the strength of the rebel forces. Instead, it decided to suppress the revolt with all its might. It brought reinforcements from England, passed new laws so that the rebels could be convicted with ease, and then moved into the storm centres of the revolt. Delhi was recaptured from the rebel forces in September 1857. The last Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar was tried in court and sentenced to life imprisonment. He and his wife were sent to prison in Rangoon in October 1858.
          </p>
<p>
           The recapture of Delhi did not mean that the rebellion died down completely. People continued to resist and battle the British. So, the British had to fight for two years to suppress the massive forces of popular rebellion. The British took Lucknow in 1858. Rani Lakshmibai was defeated and killed in June 1858. Tantia Tope, who fought a guerrilla war, was finally captured, tried and killed in April 1859.
