           Class 11 Sociology Chapter 3 NCERT Textbook Questions Solved
          </h3>
<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Note what are the marriage rules that are followed in your society. Compare your observations with those made by other students in the class. Discuss.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In Indian society marriage has been regulated by certain norms. It is an institution for man and woman to enter family life. In our society marriage is not simply a contract instead it is a comprehensive relationship. It includes emotional involvement, loyalty, commitment for each other, economic attachment and responsibility. It is a stable relationship in which man and woman are socially committed to have children and the right to have children implying the rights to sexual relations.
          </p>
<p>
           In our society, a marriage consists of a husband and wife i.e. monogamy. Individuals are allowed to marry again after the death of his/her spouse or after legal divorce.
           <br/>
           In Indian society marriage is allowed between the two particular individuals of opposite sex. There are certain restrictions on choosing the life partner in traditional conservative families related to caste and religion.
           <br/>
           In Indian society arranged marriages are preferred. Although many revolutionary changes have emerged in our society due to urbanisation, industrialisation, education among women, social reforms, globalisation and various legal modifications e.g.
           <a href="https://www.aplustopper.com/women-empowerment-essay/">
            women empowerment
           </a>
           and property rights.
          </p>
<p>
           The young generation finds it uncomfortable in marrying someone whom they have never seen or met before, whose habits,values, attitudes, beliefs they don’t know. Youths find it very stressful. Nowadays nuclear families have replaced joint families and the social support of parents is also not available. So this is a transitional period in Indian society so far institution of marriage is concerned.

<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Find out how membership, residence pattern and even the mode of interaction changes in the family with broader economic, political and cultural changes-for instance migration.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Social relations are the base of group structure. Modem society is changing rapidly and so the structure and composition. Change is a universal and continuous process. Due to industrialisation, urbanisation, globalisation, information and technology, easy availability of electric and electronic gadgets and means of commutation has tremendous influence on our communication and social interaction. Now modem society is not significantly relationship oriented instead now it is time focused society. Therefore with broader economic, political and cultural changes migration within the country as well as outside the country is a common phenomena and due to low cost calls, skype, whats app and other sources the mode of social interaction has changed.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Write an essay on ‘work’. Focus on both the range of occupations, which exist and how they change.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Work is not only for livelihood but also for satisfaction. It involves carrying out tasks which require physical and mental activities.
           <br/>
           Work refers to paid employment. It can be termed as the physical or mental efforts of the individual. It may be paid or unpaid, it is performed as services to cater the human needs. The work may be performed in direct exchange of goods of services.
           <br/>
           The economic activities other than social and political activities, form an important part of human social life.
           <br/>
           The economic activities are significant dimension of modem society which includes production and consumption.
           <br/>
           Economic Institutions coordinate activities of individuals with regard to production, distribution and consumption of goods and services in the society.
           <br/>
           Work involves many dimensions such as:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Contract: An agreement between two or more people having same rules and conditions to attain specific goals in a specified period of time.
           </li>
<li>
            Division of Labour: Refers to a system of distribution of work among the people . based on their skills and competence.
            <br/>
            Division of labour is directly connected with density of population. It makes . members of society interdependent. The modem society and its economy is
            <br/>
            technology based that requires specialisation.
           </li>
<li>
            The wages: In present industrial economy wages follow certain rules such as:
           </li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>
              Wage is fixed and essential part of contract.
             </li>
<li>
              It is impersonal and based on formal relations.
             </li>
<li>
              Wages are binding on both parties, the employee and the employer.
             </li>
<li>
              In certain economic systems, Trade Union, or Labour Unions protect the wage interests of the workers.
             </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
           There are various economic systems in which the work gets manifestation:
           <br/>
           (a) Primitive Economic System:
           <br/>
           Work and wage has no specific exchange policy. Essentially private but
           <br/>
           community based involving economic, religious and magical activities.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           (b) Agrarian Economy:
           <br/>
           This was second stage of economic system which ensured continuous food supply for workers.
           <br/>
           The occupation became caste based and barter system and jajmani system prevailed.
          </p>
<p>
           (c) Industrial Economy:
           <br/>
           This is present day economic system that began with industrialisation in England in 18 th century.
          </p>
<p>
           Capitalism and socialism emerged as two basic systems of industrialised society. This society is based on tools and machienes for the production. These economic systems regulate the work with a fixed currency.
           <br/>
           Division of labour, factory system, interdependence for production and specialisation of task are the main features of present day economy.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           Work can be categorised as:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Formal sector: Here the idea of paid employment functions.
           </li>
<li>
            Informal sector: It refers to an economy which, involves the direct exchange of goods or services. Informal economy refers to transaction outside the sphere of regular employment.
           </li>
<li>
            Service sector: In service sector most of the work is being provided to people in communication, health, education, hotel, aviation, I.T, transportations, computer etc.
           </li>
<li>
            Public sector: Employment generated by the government is called public sector work e.g. Railways, Heavy Industries. They are part of public sector. India being a welfare state many areas like transport is managed by the government only.
           </li>
<li>
            Private sector: The work which is regulated by private owners. This is basically profit making business field e.g TCS, Infosys etc.
           </li>
<li>
            PPP: It is a new concept in which public sector i.e. government and private sector coordinate each other for the development of economy.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Discuss the kind of rights that exist in your society. How do they affect your life?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Kinds of Rights
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Civil rights: Right to information, right to education, freedom of speech, freedom to follow religion, food security are several civil rights which all the people of a democratic India enjoy.
           </li>
<li>
            Social rights: All Indian citizens have right to enjoy a minimum standard of welfare and security such as health benefits. Minimum level of wages, old age benefits or employment allowance particularly for BPL people.
           </li>
<li>
            Political rights: Right to vote and freedom of expression are political rights.
           </li>
<li>
            Welfare rights: Social security in developed western countries.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           India a largest democracy in the world and being a welfare state has given above mentioned rights to her citizens.
           <br/>
           These rights have changed the structure, composition and functioning of Indian society. Freedom, equality, liberty of expression, faith and religion have changed the composition of social network and people find themselves confident, politically aware and mature. The social rights are giving poor people an opportunity of education, keeping good health and minimum wages which prevent people from exploitation. Right to franchise makes the people real king maker. Because of this right Indians can choose their government.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           How does sociology study religion?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           According to Emile Durkheim, “Religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, creating into a simple moral community all those who adhere to those beliefs and practices.”
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Sociologists study religion as the belief in spiritual beings.
           </li>
<li>
            Religion is a mode of action as well as a system of beliefs and a sociological phenomena as well as personal experience.
           </li>
<li>
            Religion rests upon beliefs in supernatural which embraces animism.
           </li>
<li>
            From sociological perspective religion performs many functions for the society. It is a form of social control.
           </li>
<li>
            Religion exists in all known societies although religious beliefs and practices vary from culture to culture.
           </li>
<li>
            Religion is only a personal phenomena, but also has a public aspect which has an important influence upon the social institution.
           </li>
<li>
            Religion is the collection of customs and rituals. Because of religion people respect the customs and norms which maintains the social network.
           </li>
<li>
            Religion encourages people to develop a complex, balanced, integrated, healthy and happy personality and get involved in social welfare activities. It helps people in maintaining internal force.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Sociologists study the public form of religion because it is quite important from social perspective which takes care of society and social institution.

           Answer:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Authority is legitimate power. It is the exercise of will which is voluntarily accepted.
           </li>
<li>
            As legitimate power, authority is socially recognized and justified. It is, therefore, based on consent.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           There are three main types of authorities or three main sources of legitimization of power.
          </p>
<p>
           1. Traditional authority: It is accepted by people out of habit. People accept the power of someone simply because it has been done so in the past. Traditional authority, therefore, rests on customs. It is not based on written laws. This authority is irrational and personal. For example, the authority of a king in a monarchy.
          </p>
<p>
           2. Charisma and authority: Here people accept the authority of a person due to extraordinary qualities of that individual. For example, Gandhi ji. This authority is neither customary nor is it based on written laws. It is both irrational and personal.
          </p>
<p>
           3. Legal rational authority: Here the power and privileges are clearly defined and limited by written rules or law.
           <br/>
           The actual power lies not in the person who wields it, but in the position that he/ she occupies. Eg. the authority of the Prime Minister in democracy.

           <br/>
           The desire for political unity of a nation expresses itself as the aspiration to form a state.
          </p>
<p>
           State: It is a community of persons, settled in a definite territory, having an organized government, and enjoying absolute independence from external control. It has the following elements:

<ul>
<li>
            Population: There can be no state without people as state is an association of people. Exact number of people essential to form a state cannot be fixed. However, just a few families can’t constitute a state. Population should be more or less numerous.
           </li>
<li>
            Territory: A group of people must occupy a clearly defined territory in order to constitute a state. A group of nomads cannot constitute a state.

This territory is under the supreme control of the state.
           </li>
<li>
            Government: It is the machinery or agency through which the state functions and exercises its will. It includes selected people to enact laws, implement them and enforce justice. It maintains official relations with other states. All members of the state are not part of the government. It includes only those officials, and departments who are elected, appointed or employed to determine and carry out the regulations of the state.
           </li>
<li>
            Sovereign: It is the absolute power of the state. State has full and independent control over its territory and population. It is independent of any external control.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           2. Nation-state: Nation states are those states in which the great mass of population are citizens who regard themselves as a part of a single nation.
           <br/>

          </p>
<ul>

           </li>
<li>
            Nation: A community with political aspirations not yet a state, not sovereign.
