<strong>
            Q.1. Write a note on
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            (a) What was meant by the ‘civilizing mission’ of the colonisers?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            (b) Huynh Phu So.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
            <br/>
</strong>
<strong>
            (a)
           </strong>
           Unlike other colonisers, the French colonisers did not aim only for economic exploitation of their colonies. The French colonising mission was also driven by the idea of a ‘civilising mission’. Just as the British had done in India, the French claimed that they would introduce modern, civilised life to the Vietnamese.
          </p>
<p>
           The French believed that like all other Europeans it was their duty to civilise the colonies even if this meant destruction to local cultures, religion and traditions.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           Kipling called it white man’s burden. It was thought that it might be possible only if the advanced countries established their colonies over the backward and uncivilised people.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            (b) Huynh Phu So :
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           After the occupation of Vietnam, the French tried to reshape the social and cultural life of the people. Vietnam’s religious beliefs were a mixture of Buddhism, Confucianism, and local practices. Christianity was intolerant of this easy-going attitude of the Vietnamese and viewed the Vietnamese tendency to revere the supernatural as something to be corrected.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           However, the religious beliefs among the peasantry were shaped by a variety of syncretic traditions i.e., aiming to bring together different beliefs and practices seeing their essential unity rather than difference.
          </p>
<p>
           These traditions combined Buddhism and local beliefs. The policy of the French gave rise to many movements. Some supported the French but others inspired movements against colonial rule.
          </p>
<p>
           One such movement was founded by Huynh Phu So. It was Hoa Hao. He performed miracles and helped the poor. His criticism against useless expenditure had a wide appeal. He also opposed the sale of child brides, gambling and the use of alcohol and opium. The French tried to suppress the movement. He was declared mad and was called the Mad Bonze. They sent him to a mental asylum. But the doctor who had to prove that he was insane became his follower. In 1941, even the French doctors declared that he was sane. The French authorities, however, exiled him to Laos. Many of his followers were sent to concentration camps.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           Political parties often drew upon their support but they could neither control nor discipline their followers. Yet the significance of such movement in arousing anti-imperialist sentiments should not be underestimated.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            Q.2. Explain the following –
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            (a) Only one-third of the students in Vietnam would pass the school-leaving examinations.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            (b) The French began building canals and draining lands in the Mekong delta.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            (c) The government made the Saigon Native Girls School take back the students it had expelled. [CBSE 2014(D)]
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Or
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Why did a major protest erupt in 1926 in the Saigon Native Girls School in Vietnam ? Explain. [CBSE 2014]
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Or
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Describe the incident that took place in 1926 in Saigon Native Girls School.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            [CBSE 2014]
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            (d) Rats were most common in the modern, newly built areas of Hanoi.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
            (a)
           </strong>
           This was largely because of a deliberate policy of failing students, particularly in the final year, so that they could not qualify for the better-paid jobs. Usually, as many as two-thirds of the students were failed, (b) The French began by building canals and draining lands in the Mekong delta to increase cultivation. The vast system of irrigation works – canals and earthworks – built mainly with forced labour, increased rice production, and allowed the export of rice to the international market. The area under rice cultivation went up from about 274,000 hectares in 1873 to around 1.1 million hectares in around 1900 and about 2.2 million in 1930. Vietnam exported two- thirds of its rice production and by 1931, had become the third largest exporter of rice in the world.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            (b)
           </strong>
           In 1926, a major protest erupted in the Saigon Native Girls School. A Vietnamese girl sitting in one of the front seats was asked to move to the back of the class, and allow a local French student to occupy the front bench. She refused. The principal, also a colon (French people in the colonies), expelled her. When angry students protested, they too were expelled, leading to a further spread of open protests. Seeing the situation getting out of control, the government forced the school to take the students back.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            (c)
           </strong>
           The French part of Hanoi was built as a beautiful and clean city with wide avenues and a well-laid-out sewer system, while the ‘native quarter’ was not provided with any modem facilities. The refuge from the old city drained straight but into the river or, during heavy rains or floods, overflowed into the streets. Thus, what was installed to create a hygienic environment in the French city became the cause of the plague. The large sewers in the modern part of the city, a symbol of modernity, were an ideal and protected breeding ground for the rats. The sewers also served as a great transport system, allowing the rats to move around the city without any problem. And rats began to enter the well-cared homes of the French through the sewage pipes.

<strong>
            Q.3. Describe the ideas behind the Tonkin Free School. To what extent was it a typical example of colonial ideas in Vietnam ? [CBSE 2009 (F), 2013 (O)]
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           Ideas behind Tonkin Schools :
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
             Spread of Western-style Education :
            </strong>
            These schools were started in 1907 to provide a Western-style education. This education included classes in science, hygiene and French (these classes were held in the evening and had to be paid for separately).
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             To consolidate their power :
            </strong>
            The French were faced with yet another problem in the sphere of education: the elites in Vietnam were powerfully influenced by Chinese culture. To consolidate their power, the French had to counter this Chinese influence. So they systematically dismantled the traditional educational system and established French schools for the Vietnamese.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Educated labour for administration :
            </strong>
            The French needed an educated local labour force.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             To demonstrate superiority of French culture :
            </strong>
            Many scholars believed that by learning the language, the Vietnamese would be introduced to the culture and civilisation of France. This would help create an ‘Asiatic France solidly tied to European France’. The educated people in Vietnam would respect French sentiments and ideals, see the superiority of French culture, and work for the French
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
            It was a typical example of colonial ideas as
           </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
             Civilising Mission :
            </strong>
            Like the British in India, the French claimed that they were bringing modern civilisation to the Vietnamese. They took for granted that Europe had developed the most advanced civilisation. So it became the duty of the Europeans to introduce these modern ideas to the colony even if this meant destroying local cultures, religions and traditions, because these were seen as outdated and prevented modem development.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Racial Discrimination policy :
            </strong>
            The French considered themselves as superior race. They started policy of discrimination even in schools also. The front rows in the schools were reserved for the French students only.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Justification of French rule :
            </strong>
            School textbooks glorified the French and justified colonial rule. The Vietnamese were represented as primitive and backward, capable of manual labour but not of intellectual reflection; they could work in the

             Failing the Vietnamese in the final year :
            </strong>
            Only the Vietnamese elite – comprising a small fraction of the population – could enroll in the schools, and only a few among those admitted ultimately passed the school­leaving examination. This was largely because of a deliberate policy of failing students, particularly in the final year, so that they could not qualify for the better-paid jobs.

           Chau and Trinh, both wanted to modernise Vietnam.
           <br/>
           In short, both Chau and Trinh were looking at the same end – a free sovereign modern Vietnam.

<li>
            The modern part of Hanoi was struck by bubonic plague. To fight the plague, French started Rat Hunt programme in 1902.

<li>
            The French hired Vietnamese workers to catch the rats and paid them for the same. This proved a failed attempt.
