<p>
<strong>
            Answer the following questions.
           </strong>
<br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Question 1:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           What was the author’s opinion about Mr Gessler as a bootmaker?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           The author was very impressed with Mr Gessler. He liked the boots made only on order and those boots perfectly fitted the customers. Their boots had the best materials and lasted long. He found the work mysterious and wonderful.
          </p>
<p>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Question 2:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Why did the author visit the shop so infrequently?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           The author visited the shop so infrequently because the boots made by Gessler brothers lasted too long.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Question 3:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           What was the effect on Mr Gessler of the author’s remark about a certain pair of boots?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Mr (Sessler at first found the remark unbelievable. He argued that the author might have got them wet. He was shocked. He told the author that he will either repair them or adjust the money in his bills.
          </p>
<p>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Question 4:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           What was Mr Gessler’s complaint against ‘big farms’?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Mr Gessler complained that the big firms didn’t value the money of the customers. They were capturing the markets from advertisements and not from the quality of their work. He was mostly out of work because of those firms and day by day the volume was getting reduced.
          </p>
<p>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Question 5:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Why did the author order so many pairs of boots? Did he really need them?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           The author felt bad for Mr Gessler who was really talented and made great boots. He ordered so many pairs to help the bootmaker. No, he didn’t really need them.

             Question 1:
            </span>
</strong>
<br/>
           Do you think Mr Gessler was a failure as a bootmaker or as a competitive businessman?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Mr Gessler was successful as a bootmaker because his customers were immensely satisfied with the boot he made.
           <br/>
           This perfectly fit them and lasted long. Yes, he was a failure as a competitive businessman.
           <br/>
           He didn’t have money like the big firms so couldn’t invest on advertisements. He lost his business to them. He took time in delivering the boots because he made them alone. He lost his customers because of the delay in delivery.
           <br/>
           He worked hard, striving for long hours. Whatever, he earned went on paying the rent for his shop and for buying leathers. He spent days of great penury.
          </p>
<p>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Question 2:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           What is the significance of the title? To who or to what does it refer?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           The title refers to the great quality boots Mr Gessler made. It is an ideal title for the lesson. It refers to the business practices followed these days where no one cares about quality.
           <br/>
           For Mr Gessler, quality was of optimum significance. He worked for long hours, didn’t allow anyone else to touch his boots. He lost on business, was spending days in poverty still the man didn’t compromise on quality.
          </p>

             Question 3:
            </strong>
</span>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
            Notice the way Mr Gessler speaks English. His
            <br/>
            English is influenced by his mother tongue. He speaks English with an accent.
           </li>
<li>
            When Mr Gessler speaks, p, t, k, sound like b,d,g. Can you say these words as Mr Gessler would say them?
            <br/>
            It comes and never stops. Does it bother me? Not at all. Ask my brother, please.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Mr Gessler used to speak English with a German accent. His English sounded funny and a bit difficult to understand.
           <br/>
           Mr Gessler would have spoken these lines as. Id comes and never sdobs. Does Id bodder me? Nod ad all. Ask my brodher blease.

             Question 4:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Speak to five adults in your neighbourhood. Ask them the following questions (in any language they are comfortable in). Then come back and share your findings with the class.
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Do they buy their provisions packed in plastic packets at a big store or loose, from a smaller store near their house?
           </li>
<li>
            Where do they buy their footwear? Do they buy branded footwear or footwear made locally? What reasons do they have for their preference?
           </li>
<li>
            Do they buy readymade clothes or buy cloth and get their clothes stitched by a tailor? Which do they think is better?
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
            Yes, they prefer buying their provisions loose from the smaller stores near their house.
           </li>
<li>
            They buy footwear for daily purpose from local shops. For office and part purpose they prefer buying it from branded shops.
            <br/>
            They don’t like spending too much on their regular footwear. So, they buy it from local shops.
            <br/>
            For office and party they want to look good and want the footwear to last long and comfortable. So, they are fine spending on it.
           </li>
<li>
            They do the both. At times they buy readymade clothes and at times get them stitched from the tailor. They find it easy to buy readymade clothes. They get the latest fashion and it saves time as well.

<strong>

</span>
<br/>
           Begin like this Last month my aunt decided to visit her parents. They live in some other city. In absence of my aunt my uncle had to do all the cooking. He is very forgetful and absent-minded. One day he puts vegetable on stove for cooking and at the same time he goes out to clean his bicycle.
           <br/>
           My uncle got involved in cleaning his bicycle so much that he completely forgot about the vegetables he had kept on the stove. One of his neighbour came to his place hurriedly telling about some burning smell coming from his kitchen. My uncle remembered about the vegetables he had kept on stove for cooking.
           <br/>
           He rushed to the kitchen and to save them from getting burnt he poured some oil over them immediately. Only at the time of eating he realised it was not cooking oil but machine oil. The vegetables were completely spoiled, my uncle had to throw them away.

<strong>
             Question 1:
            </strong>
</span>

<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>

           Quality is an important aspect of business. Elaborate
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Quality plays an important role in business. Every customer looks for quality in the products they buy. Everyone wants to buy an item that has high quality. If we keep the quality of our products high then our customers will visit us again. Popularity of our products also increases in the market. But in other hand if, we sell products of low quality then people might buy them once but will feel being cheated. They will never lose our trust and we will lose them as customer forever.
