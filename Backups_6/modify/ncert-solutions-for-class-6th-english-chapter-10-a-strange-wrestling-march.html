The ghost again tried his best to crush the stone but in vain. Meanwhile Vijay Singh took out the lump of salt from his pocket and crushed it easily. This time too, he proved himself victorious. Thus, by using the egg and the lump of salt he successfully outwitted the ghost.

<strong>

<br/>
<strong>
            Ans:
           </strong>
           The story of the trial of strength between a ghost and Vijay Singh cannot be true or believable. Nobody can see a ghost in human form. It does not live in a house or a cave. It does not collect wealth. It does not panic or run away in fear.The ghost in the stoiy was, only a dacoit who used to rob the rich and kill them

<strong>
            Ans:
           </strong>
           The ghost invited Vijay Singh to his cave. He vowed silently to kill the wres­tler. He offered Vijay Singh a comfortable bed to sleep on. Vijay Singh saw through the ghost’s trick. He lay awake and at mid night, he slipped off his bed. He put a bolster in his place on the bed. Early next morning the ghost hit the bolster with his club. He took his enemy for dead. But. Vijay Singh faced the ghost who panicked. He fled from the cave leaving behind all his wealth for Vijay Singh.
