           Question 4.
           <br/>
           On adding dilute sulphuric acid to a test tube containing a metal â€˜Xâ€™, a colourless gas is produced when a burning match stick is brought near it. Which of the following correctly represents metal â€˜Xâ€™?
           <br/>
           (A) Sodium
           <br/>
           (B) Zinc
           <br/>
           (C) Copper
           <br/>
           (D) Silver
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (A) Sodium
           <br/>
           Detailed Answer: The metal X is sodium. On reaction with sodium metal to the sulphuric acid, sodium replaces the hydrogen ion and forms sodium sulphate and hydrogen gas. When a lighted matchstick is brought near the mouth of the test tube containing hydrogen gas, it burns with a pop-up sound.

           Question 6.
           <br/>
           An element with atomic number will form a basic oxide.
           <br/>
           (A)7 (2,5)
           <br/>
           (B) 17 (28,7)
           <br/>
           (C) 142,84)
           <br/>
           (D) 11 (28,1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (D) 11 (28,1)
           <br/>
           Detailed Answer:
           <br/>
           Metals form basic oxide and can have 1 to 3 electrons in their outermost shell while non-metals can form acidic oxides and have 4 to 8 electrons in their outermost shell. Hence, element with atomic number 11 (electronic configuration 2, 8,1) is metal (Na) and it will form basic oxide.

           <br/>
           (b) Q â€“ Brown, R â€“ Brown
           <br/>
           The colours of both Q and R regions when tested with iodine solution appeared brown. This indicates that there was no starch in both regions. In both regions Q and R photosynthesis did not occur, since part Q of the leaf was covered by the cut part of the cork, while part R was exposed to KOH kept in the flask to absorb CO

           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           (for R), photosynthesis did not occur, thus starch was not formed and regions Q and R tested negative with iodine (A positive test for starch converts the leaf blue-black with iodine). (1)

           Question 12.
           <br/>
           A sportsman, after a long break of his routine exercise, suffered muscular cramps during a heavy exercise session. This happened due to:
           <br/>
           (A) lack of carbon dioxide and formation of pyruvate.
           <br/>
           (B) presence of oxygen and formation of ethanol.
           <br/>
           (C) lack of oxygen and formation of lactic acid.
           <br/>
           (D) lack of oxygen and formation of carbon dioxide.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (C) lack of oxygen and formation of lactic acid.
           <br/>
           Detailed Answer:
           <br/>
           During heavy exercise, the energy demand is high but the supply of oxygen to produce energy is limited. Therefore, anaerobic respiration takes places in the muscles cells to fulfill the energy demand. This anaerobic breakdown of glucose leads to the formation of lactic add in musdes. The accumulation of lactic add in musdes leads to muscle cramps.

           Aray of light is travelling from A to B and another ray is travelling from B to C.
           <br/>
           (a) In which of the two cases the refracted ray bends towards the normal?
           <br/>
           (b) In which case does the speed of light increase in the second medium? Give reasons for your answer.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) When light travels from an optically rarer medium to an optically denser medium, it moves towards the normal. Since n
           <sub>
            8
           </sub>
           &gt; n
           <sub>
            a
           </sub>
           hence the light ray will bend towards the normal on passing from medium A to B.
           <br/>
           (b) The speed of the light will increase when the light travels from B to C, Since n
           <sub>

           &lt; n

            8
           </sub>
           and v = (c/n), the speed of light ray will increase in the second medium.

<br/>
           In the case of an ideal solenoid, the magnetic field strength is maximum at point A and is minimum or zero at point B. This is because the magnetic field is strong, where magnetic field lines are crowded, and is weak, where magnetic field lines are far apart. At point C, the density of the field lines is less than that of point A but greater than that of point B. So, the order of the magnetic field at points A, B, and C is B

           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) 10000J because only 10 % of energy is available for the next trophic level.
           <br/>
           (b) No, since the loss of energy at each step is so great that very little usable energy will remain after 4 trophic levels.

           Question 30.
           <br/>
           What is the probability of a girl or a boy being born in a family? Justify your answer.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           There are 50% chances that a girl may be born and 50% chances that a boy may be bom.
           <br/>
           It can be explained as follows:
           <br/>
           (i) Most human chromosomes have a maternal copy and a paternal copy. We have 22 such chromosomes. One pair of chromosomes called sex chromosomes is odd in not always being a perfect pair. Women have a perfect pair of sex chromosomes, both called X. (XX)
           <br/>
           (ii)But men have a mismatched pair of sex chromosomes in which one is normal sized â€“ X chromosome while the other is a short one called Y chromosome. (XY)
           <br/>
           (iii) A child receives one chromosome from mother which is essentially X chromosome.
           <br/>
           (iv) A child who inherits an X chromosome from her father will be a girl, and one who inherits a Y chromosome from him will be a boy.

           <br/>
           (a) The solenoid behaves like a magnet.
           <br/>
           (b) The solenoid is a temporary magnet.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) A solenoid is a long coil of circular loops of insulated copper wire. Magnetic field lines are produced around the solenoid when a current is allowed to flow through it. The field lines produced by it are similar to the field lines produced by a bar magnet which can be seen in the figure.

           (b) The solenoid behaves like a temporary magnet which is formed by placing a soft iron core inside it. The magnetism of this magnet lasts so long as there is current flowing through it and loses its magnetic property when the current in the solenoid is stopped. It is also known as an electromagnet.

           Question 35.
           <br/>
           Given below are certain situations. Analyse and describe its possible impact on a person.
           <br/>
           (a) The fallopian tube of a female is plugged.
           <br/>
           (b) Ovaries are not functional.
           <br/>
           (c) The urethra is not functioning properly.
           <br/>
           (d) Testosterone is not produced by the testis.
           <br/>
           (e) Oestrogen and progesterone are not secreted by the ovaries.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (a) What are animal hormones? List their two characteristics.
           <br/>
           (b) Name the hormone,
           <br/>
           (i) which brings change in male humans during the beginning of adolescence.
           <br/>
           (ii) which coordinates the level of sugar in blood?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) If the fallopian tube of a female is plugged then the egg will not be able to reach the uterus. Therefore, fertilization will not take place.
           <br/>
           (b) If ovaries are not functional in the females then it will not produce ova or egg cells, which are necessary for the process of fertilization.
           <br/>
           (c) As urethra is a common passage for both sperm and urine. So, if the urethra is not functioning properly, it will affect the transport of sperm.
           <br/>
           (d) The testosterone also known as male sex hormone is produced by the testis. So if the testis does not produce testosterone, then it will not bring sexual maturation at puberty.
           <br/>
           (e) Oestrogen and progesterone are the female sex hormones. These bring about sexual character during puberty and also play a major role in menstruation. (1 Ã— 5)
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (a) Hormones are chemical substances, which control and coordinate the activities performed by organisms.
           <br/>
           Characteristics of Hormones:
           <br/>
           (i) They are poured directly into the bloodstream and are carried throughout the body by the circulatory system.
           <br/>
           (ii) They act only on the specific target organs.
           <br/>
           (b) (i) Testosterone produced by the testes regulates the changes in males during the adolescence period.
           <br/>
           (ii) Insulin (decreases blood sugar) and glucagon (increases blood sugar), secreted by the pancreas coordinate the sugar level in blood.

           (i) State what happens when switch A is connected to
           <br/>
           (a) Position 2
           <br/>
           (b) Position 3
           <br/>
           (ii) Find the potential difference across each lamp when lit.
           <br/>
           (iii) Calculate the current
           <br/>
           (a) in each Î© lamp when lit.
           <br/>
           (b) In each Î© lamp when lit.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) (a) 12 Î© lamps (only) ON.
           <br/>
           (b) 4 Î© lamps (only) ON
           <br/>
           (ii) 12 V for both sets of lamps because all of them are in parallel.
           <br/>
           (iii) (a) 12 Î© lamps are ON when the wire is connected to position 2.
           <br/>
           voltage across both 12 Î© lamps = 12 V
           <br/>
           V = IR (Ohmâ€™s law)
           <br/>
           I = \(\frac{V}{R}=\frac{12}{12}\) = 1A.
           <br/>
           (b) 4 Î© lamps are ON when the wire is connected to position 3.
           <br/>
           Voltage across both 4 Î© lamps = 12 V
           <br/>
           V = IR (Ohmâ€™s law).
           <br/>
           I = \(\frac{V}{R}=\frac{12}{4}\) = 3A.
          </p>
<p>
           OR
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) Show, with calculations, which type of lamp, 4.0 Î© or 12.Î©, has the higher power.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           P = V
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
           /R
           <br/>
           All lamps are in parallel and hence same V for all lamps.
           <br/>
           For 4 Î© lamps â†’ P = \(\frac{12 \times 12}{4}\) = 36W
           <br/>
           For 12 Î© lamps â†’ P = \(\frac{12 \times 12}{12}\) = 12W
           <br/>
           Hence 4 Î© lamps will have higher power.
          </p>

           (a) State what happens when switch A is connected to
           <br/>
           (i) Position 2
           <br/>
           (ii) Position 3
           <br/>
           (b) Find the potential difference across each lamp when lit.
           <br/>
           (c) Calculate the current
           <br/>

           (ii) in each 4 â„¦ lamp when lit.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Show, with calculations, which type of lamp, 4.0 â„¦ or 12 â„¦, has the higher power.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) (i) 12 â„¦ lamp (only) on
           <br/>
           (ii) 4 â„¦ lamps (only) on (1)
          </p>
<p>
           (b) 12V for both sets of lamps and all of them are in parallel. (1)
          </p>
<p>
           (c) (i) 12 â„¦ lamps are on when the wire is connected to position 2.
           <br/>
           The voltage across both 12 â„¦ lamps = 12 V
           <br/>
           V = IR
           <br/>
           I = \(\frac{V}{R}\)
           <br/>
           = \(\frac{12}{12}\)
           <br/>
           = 1A
           <br/>
           (ii) lamps are on when the wire is connected to position 3.
           <br/>
           The voltage across both 4 â„¦ lamps = 12 V
           <br/>
           V = IR
           <br/>
           I = \(\frac{V}{R}\)
           <br/>
           = \(\frac{12}{4}\)
           <br/>
           = 3A (2)
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Power, P = V
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
           /R
           <br/>
           All lamps are in parallel and hence same V for all lamps.
           <br/>
           For 4 â„¦ lamps, P = \(\frac{12 \times 12}{4}\) = 36W
           <br/>
           For 12 â„¦ lamps, P = \(\frac{12 \times 12}{12}\) = 12W
           <br/>
           Hence, 4 â„¦ lamps will have higher power. (2)
