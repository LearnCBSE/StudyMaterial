<p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           The presence of both a leading and a lagging strand is observed during DNA replication. This is because
           <br/>
           (a) RNA primers are not sufficient enough to facilitate replication of both strands
           <br/>
           (b) only one DNA template is available for reading at a time
           <br/>
           (c) DNA polymerase can catalyse synthesis of one strand at a time
           <br/>
           (d) DNA polymerase reads only in 5â€² â€“ 3â€² direction
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (d) Since, DNA polymerase reads only in 5â€² â€“ 3â€² direction, it can replicate the strand with 3â€² â€“ 5â€² orientation continuously, which is called the leading strand. On the strand with 5â€² â€“ 3â€² polarity, DNA replicates in fragmented manner. This is the lagging strand. Thus, both the leading and lagging strands are present together during DNA replication.

           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Transgenic animals are generally created for a variety of medical reasons except
           <br/>
           (a) for testing vaccine safety
           <br/>
           (b) for manufacturing of physiologically important proteins
           <br/>
           (e) stimulation of pathogenicity
           <br/>
           (d) for toxicity tests
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (c) Transgenic animals are created by introducing a foreign genes in animals. These are created for following benefits
           <br/>
           (i) Study of biological effects of new proteins.
           <br/>
           (ii) Understanding the role of genes in development of diseases.
           <br/>
           (iii) Testing safety of new drugs, vaccines or other proteins, chemicals, etc.
           <br/>
           They are never used in stimulation of pathogenicity.
           <br/>
           Hence, option (c) is incorrect.

           (a) Darwinâ€™s variations were small and directional
           <br/>
           (b) Fitness is the end result of the capability of an individual to get selected by nature
           <br/>
           (c) New species evolves from ancestral forms by the struggle for limited resources
           <br/>
           (d) Abrupt and drastic changes cause speciation
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (d) Statement given in option (d) is incorrect and can be corrected as
           <br/>
           The abrupt and drastic changes are called as mutation. These changes are inheritable and results in speciation. This was not a part of Darwinâ€™s theory of evolution.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Gel electrophoresis separates the fragments of DNA on the basis of size, shape, molecular weight, . etc. Since, DNA has negative charge, the fragments move toward the anode. The smaller fragments move faster due to lesser friction, while larger fragments move slowly. Thus, the location of 3 kb is correct, as it will present nearest to the anode, i.e. near to positive electrode and farthest from well.

           Question Nos. 13 to 16 consist of two statements, Assertion (A) and Reason (R). Answer these questions by selecting the appropriate option given below.
           <br/>
           (a) Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion
           <br/>
           (b) Both Assertion and Reason are true, but Reason is not the correct explanation of Assertion
           <br/>
           (c) Assertion is true, but Reason is false
           <br/>
           (d) Assertion is false, but Reason is true
          </p>
<p>
           Question 13.
           <br/>
           Assertion (A) : Our immune system always recognise the â€˜self cellsâ€™ and destroys the foreign proteins.
           <br/>
           Reason (R) : When the system fails to recognise the â€˜selfâ€™ from â€˜non-selfâ€™, it
           <br/>
           starts destroying the bodyâ€™s own proteins. This is known as autoimmunity.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (b) Both Assertion and Reason are true, but Reason is not the correct explanation of Assertion.
           <br/>
           Our immune system has the ability to distinguish between self and non-self cells. Because every cell in the body has the presence of antigens. These antigens are particular and differ from one organism to another.
          </p>
<p>
           Due to this, when the immune cells detect any other antigen a part from self antigen, they quickly initiate immune responses in the body.

           Question 14.
           <br/>
           Assertion (A) : The distance between two polynucleotide chains in DNA remains almost constant.
           <br/>
           Reason (R) : A purine is paired with pyrimidine with hydrogen bonds.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion.
           <br/>
           The distance between two polynucleotides is almost constant because the purines always paired with pyrimidine with hydrogen bonds, i.e. Adenine always form two hydrogen bonds with Thymine (A = T) similarly Guanine always form three hydrogen bonds with cytosine (G â‰¡ C ).
          </p>
<p>
           Question 15.
           <br/>
           Assertion (A) : Constant gene frequencies over several generations indicate an absence of evolutionary progress.
           <br/>
           Reason (R) : Evolution occurs when genetic equilibrium is absent.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion.
          </p>
<p>
           Constant gene frequencies (p
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
           + 2pq + q
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
           = 1) over several generations indicate that evolution is not taking place in the population.
          </p>
<p>
           For evolutionary progress, changes in gene frequencies is essential, this constant equilibrium is changed by random mating, mutation, gene flow, genetic drift and genetic recombination.
          </p>
<p>
           These processes introduce variations in a population which serves as raw material for evolution.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 16.
           <br/>
           Assertion (A) : Meiosis is the cell division which occurs in the sexually reproducing organisms.
           <br/>
           Reason (R) : Meiotic cell division results into two cells having exactly same genetic makeup.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (c) Assertion is true, but Reason is false. Reason can be corrected as
           <br/>
           In meiosis, the resultant cells do not have exactly same genetic makeup due to the process of crossing over.

           (i) What is the role of enzyme Z in the above experiment?
           <br/>
           (ii) Will the outcome of this experiment be successful? Give your opinion along with your answer.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Enzyme Z joins the foreign DNA to plasmid.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) The restriction enzymes cut the DNA strands in the centre of their palindromic restriction sites. This creates single-stranded unpaired bases, i.e. sticky ends.
           <br/>
           These ends can form hydrogen bonds with their complementary cut counter parts. For RDT, this is necessary to form a recombinant molecule. To achieve this both the vector DNA and DNA/gene of interest is cut with same restriction enzymes which is not done in this experiment. Hence, this experiment will not yield successful results.

           <br/>
           Discuss one example based on your day to day observations, showing how loss of one species may lead to the extinction of another.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) A is natality or immigration.
           <br/>
           B is mortality or emigration.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Natality is the rate of production of new individuals per unit of population per unit time.
           <br/>
           Immigration is permanent inward movement of individuals into a habitat.
           <br/>
           Both these processes add to the size of population.
           <br/>
           Mortality is the number of deaths per unit time.
           <br/>
           Emigration is the permanent outward movement of individuals from their habitat to elsewhere. Both these processes decrease the size of a population.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Co-extinction is the extinction of two mutually related or inter-related species, for instance a fast fish extinction leads to the extinction of all those parasites exclusively found on it. Another example is plant pollinator where extinction of one leads to the extinction of other.

           <br/>
           (i) The diagram showing elephantiasis which is caused by Wuchereria bancrofti.
          </p>
<p>
           No, this is a vector mediated infection. When mosquitoes carrying the immature larvae called microfilariae bites a person, these larvae enter the body and develop in the lymph nodes and it does not transmit by direct contact with infected person.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Preventive measures are
           <br/>
           (a) Maintain hygiene in surroundings.
           <br/>
           (b) Mosquito breeding grounds should be destroyed, since these are vectors which transmit this disease.

           Question 23.
           <br/>
           Explain the levels of biodiversity at genetic, specific and ecological levels with the help of one example each.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Genetic diversity A single species shows diversity at the genetic level over its distributional range. For example, the genetic variation showed by the plant Rauwolfia vomitoria growing in the different Himalayan ranges might be in terms of the potency and concentration of reserpine.
          </p>
<p>
           Species diversity It is the diversity at the species level or the measure of the variety of species and their relative abundance with the region. For example, the Western Ghats have a greater amphibian species diversity than the Eastern Ghats.
          </p>
<p>
           Ecological diversity At the ecosystem level, India shows diversity with its deserts, rainforests, mangroves, coral reefs and alpine meadows.

           Question 26.
           <br/>
           Explain enzyme replacement therapy to treat adenosine deaminase deficiency. Mention two disadvantages of this procedure.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Adenosine deaminase deficiency is a genetic disorder. The disorder is caused due to the deletion of the gene for adenosine deaminase, the enzyme crucial for the immune system to function.
          </p>
<p>
           Adenosine deaminase deficiency in patients can be treated by enzyme replacement therapy. In this treatment, patients are regularly injected with the functional ADA enzyme.
          </p>
<p>
           Disadvantages of this process
           <br/>
           (i) It does not completely eradicate the disease
           <br/>
           (ii) The requirement of repeated doses of the enzyme makes it expensive.

           (b) Name any two fields where PCR is used.
           <br/>
           (ii) What is the denaturation process?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) By introducing cry I Ac and cry II Ab genes, the host will become resistant to infestation by bollworms, e.g. Bt cotton.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) The Bt gene derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis codes for the Cry protein, which normally exists in an inactive form. As soon as the target insect feeds on the Bt cotton, the toxic protein produced in the plants, gets converted into its active form due to alkaline pH of the gut of insect.
           <br/>
           The activated protein then binds to the surface of insectâ€™s midgut and creates pores that cause swelling, lysis and eventually death of the insect.

           Question 28.
           <br/>
           Flowering plants have developed many devices to discourage self-pollination and to â€˜ encourage cross-pollination. Explain three such devices.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The mechanisms/processess that plants use to avoid self-pollination are known as outbreeding devices.
          </p>
<p>
           The three outbreeding devices that flowering plants have developed to discourage self-pollination are
           <br/>
           (i) Unisexuality : (Dicliny) Flowers are unisexual, so that self-pollination is not possible. These plants may be monoecious (bearing both male and female flowers, e.g. maize) or dioecious (bearing male and female flowers on different plants, e.g. mulberry, papaya).
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Dichogamy Anthers and stigmas mature at different times in a bisexual flower for preventing self-pollination.
           <br/>
           (a) Protandry : Anthers mature earlier than stigma of the same flower. The pollen thus become available to stigmas of the older flowers, e.g. sunflower, Salvia.
           <br/>
           (b) Protogyny : Stigmas mature earlier, so that they get pollinated before the anthers of the same flowers develop pollen grains, e.g. Mirabilis jalapa, Gloriosa, Plantago.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) The third device to prevent self-pollination is self-incompatibility. It is a genetic mechanism that prevents self-pollen from fertilising the ovules by preventing pollen germination or pollen tube growth in the pistil. All these methods encourage cross-pollination thus, causing genetic variations among them.
          </p>
<p>
           In flowering plants cross-pollination is preferred because it brings variation which helps the plants to defend against diseases and increase their survival rate.

           Study the figure of a floating hydrophyte plant that grows in water bodies.
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 12 Biology Set 4 with Solutions 10" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-153753" height="299" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-12-Biology-Set-4-with-Solutions-10.png" width="251"/>
<br/>
           (i) On the basis of your knowledge about pollination, identify the mechanism of pollination in this plant.
           <br/>
           (ii) This type of pollination mechanism is quite rare, limited to around 30 genera. The plants exhibiting this mechanism must have some special
           <br/>
           characteristics. Describe these characteristics. (Any 2)
           <br/>
           (iii) If a plant has pollen grains, small, light dry, dusty and non-sticky and winged, while stigma â€“ large, hairy and feathery, will they use a similar mechanism for exchanging gametes?
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (iii) If a plant has to get pollinated by insect, what characteristics should it exhibit?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) The plant is Vallisneria, where the flowers are borne underwater. For pollination, water is required as the agency/medium. This mechanism is known as hydrophilly.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Specific features associated with water pollinated plants are
           <br/>
           (a) stigma are long and sticky.
           <br/>
           (b) pollen grains are long, ribbon like and coated by a mucilaginous covering.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) A plant with small, light, dry, non-sticky pollens and large, hairy, feathery stigma are adapted to get pollinated by wind. This mechanism is known as anemophily.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (iii) (a) Insect pollinated flowers should be large, colourful and fragrant.
           <br/>
           (b) Flowers have nectar glands, which secrete nectar to attract pollinators for feeding.

           Question 30.
           <br/>
           In order to build a longitudinal dataset a record of adult finches Geospiza fortis living on one of the Galapagos islands was created. The data collected was associated with the variations in beak shape of birds. The records taken between 1981 â€“ 2020 are shown in the graph.
           <br/>

<br/>
           (i) What lead to the diversity in beak shape among the finches?
           <br/>
           (ii) The graph as a whole does not represent any evolutionary changes in the beaks since time interval is too small, where evolutionary progress can take thousands of years to occur. Is the above observation correct? Discuss your opinion on this.
           <br/>
           (iii) Galapagos finches affort an excellent example of adaptive radiation. Comment.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (iii) â€˜Homology results in divergenceâ€™.
           <br/>
           Elaborate.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) The diversity in the beak shape is most probably due to changes in environment which lead to natural selection and gene flow among species.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) The graph indicate evolutionary change. It has been verified that evolution can occur with surprising speed based on selection pressures. The selection in case of finches was strong and new populations evolved within a matter of generations.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Galapagos finches affort an excellent example of adaptive radiation where an organism adapts to new ecological contexts. It is assumed that a stock of ancestral finches reached the islands from the mainland in the absence of much competition, evolved to fill many of the empty ecological niches during which their beaks changed in size and morphology as an adaptation towards different diets.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (iii) In divergent evolution, a same basic organ becomes adapted by specialisation to perform different functions in order to adapt to different environmental conditions in their habitat. Such organs are called as homologous.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           Addiction starts with periodic or repeated consumption of a drug which was initially prescribed for the treatment of a medical condition. However, the effect of these drugs, make people with dependent on them. Sometimes people start using drugs for fun, under peers pressure or during extremely stressed periods. People usually become dependent on drugs because of the affect they have on brain. They imitate brain chemicals or induce the brain to release larger amounts of naturally occurring chemicals.
          </p>
<p>
           Treatment of any addiction is called deaddiction. In order to help my friend to wean off from drug abuse, first I will talk to him. We will try to discuss the problems or situations in his life, which are pushing him towards drug use. Gradually parents, teachers can get involved. Along with this therapy can also help him with deaddiction or counselling.

           (i) Based on the graph, it appears that there is a selective pressure on the species under study to change according to the environmental changes. Provide an example in support of the above observation.
           <br/>
           (ii) Phenotypes are raw material for natural selection. Why so?

           Or
           <br/>

<br/>
           (i) Give the possible genotypes and phenotypes of the individual 1, 2, 3 and 4.
           <br/>
           (ii) Which antigen(s) will be present on the plasma membranes of RBCs of individual 5 and 10?
           <br/>
           (iii) Among the individuals in generations-II and III, who can be used as
           <br/>
           (a) donor for any recipient?
           <br/>
           (b) recipient for any donor. Give reason for your answer.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) The graph represents the selection of modification . or change in favour of one extreme while eliminating the other. This can be verified by studying the example given below Industrial melanism It refers to the evolution of dark body colour in animal species that live in habitats blackened by industrial soot. The occurrence of industrial melanism is closely associated with the progress of the industrial revolution in Great Britain during the 19th century. The peppered moth (Bistort betularia) existed in two varieties, i.e. light-coloured (white) and dark coloured (black). Before the emergence of industrialisation, the white moth were numerous than dark moth in Britain.
           <br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-153759" height="212" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-12-Biology-Set-4-with-Solutions-15.png" width="294"/>
<br/>
           However, after industrialisation, i.e. in 1920, the condition was reversed. This was because the white moth were easily spotted by predators on soot covered tree trunks, so there population decreased due to increased predation and the population of black moths increased. We can also say that black moths got naturally selected.
           <br/>
           However, no variant was completely wiped out.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Phenotypes indirectly adapts a population to its environment by selecting and maintaining favourable genotypes in their gene pool. And the process of natural selection acts on the phenotype along with the physical, biochemical and behavioural traits of an organism. Thus, it can be said that phenotypes are raw material for natural selection.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           (i) Possible genotypes and phenotypes of individual 1,3 and 4 are as follows

           <br/>
           (b) Recipient for any donor blood group are 5,12 and 13. This is because AB individuals can produce both the A and B antigens.

           Question 33.
           <br/>
           Trace the changes occurring in the oogonia during the transition of a primary follicle to Graafian follicle.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Starting with the zygote, trace the appearance of different stages in the embryo development in dicot plants.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The germinal epithelial cells divide repeatedly until many diploid oogonia are formed. The oogonia grow to form primary oocytes. Each primary oocyte then gets surrounded by a layer of granulosa cells and then called the primary follicle.
          </p>
<p>
           The primary follicles get surrounded by more layers of granulosa cells and called secondary follicles. The secondary follicle soon transforms into a tertiary follicle which is characterised by a fluid-filled cavity called antrum.
          </p>
<p>
           The primary oocyte within the tertiary follicle undergoes meiotic division to become a secondary oocyte and a first polar body (haploid). The tertiary follicle further changes into the mature follicle or Graafian follicle that ruptures to release the secondary oocyte (ovum) from the ovary by the process called ovulation.
           <br/>

<br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           The first stage in the development of a plant zygote is a pre-determined mode of development (embryogeny). It gives rise to an organised mass of cells called the embryo, that has the potentiality to form a complete plant. Most zygotes divide only after certain amount of endosperm is formed to assure proper nutrition is provided to the developing embryo.
          </p>
<p>
           In the majority of angiosperms, the zygote (fertilised egg) divides by an asymmetric mitotic division and generates two cells with two different fates.
           <br/>
           (i) The smaller daughter cell with dense cytoplasm is situated towards the chalazal pole. It is called
           <br/>
           terminal cell or apical cell or embryonal cell
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Another comparatively larger daughter cell situated towards the micropylar cell, is called basal cell. This cell divides transversely and gives rise to suspensor cells. The zygote gives rise to the proembryo and subsequently to the globular, heart-shaped and mature embryo.
          </p>
<p>
           Though the seeds differ greatly, the early stages of embryo development (embryogeny) are similar in monocots and dicots.
