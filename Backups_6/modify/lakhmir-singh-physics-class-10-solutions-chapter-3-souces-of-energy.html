<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Solution :
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Renewable source of energy can be used again and again endlessly, where as non-renewable source of energy cannot be renewed once used.
           <br/>
           Ex. Renewable sources of energy are wind energy, ocean energy.
           <br/>
           Non-renewable sources of energy are coal, fossil fuel.

             Question 17:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Coal is said to be formed from the wood of trees. Why then is coal considered to be a non-renewable source of energy whereas wood is a renewable source of energy ?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Solution :
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Coal is a non-renewable source of energy because it has accumulated in the earth over a very. very long time, and if all the coal gets exhausted, it cannot be produced quickly in nature.
           <br/>
           Wood is considered as a renewable source of energy because if trees are cut to obtain wood, then more trees will grow in due course of time.

</span>
<br/>
           Write a short note on the pollution caused by burning fossil fuels.
           <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Solution :
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Burning of fossil fuels leads to the production of many acidic gases like sulphur-dioxide and nitrogen dioxides. These gases causes acid rain which damages trees, plants and buildings, reduces fertility of soil, and poses danger to aquatic life. The burning of fossil fuels puts a poisonous gas carbon monoxide in air. It also produces large amount of CO2 gas which damages the environment in the long run by increasing the greenhouse effect. Also, burning of fossil fuels produces smoke and a lot of ash.

<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Solution :

<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Solution :
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Concave and plane mirrors are used for making solar cooker because concave mirror converges a large amount of sun’s rays at a point that is required for high heating and plane mirror reflects the rays of light in the form of a strong beam of sunlight on the top of the box that is required for moderate heating.

</span>
<br/>
           A large coal-fired power station produces 2000 MW of electrical energy. A wind turbine with 33 m blades can produce 300 kW.
           <br/>
           (a) How many turbines would be needed to replace the power station ?
           <br/>
           (b) Why, in actual practice, this number of turbines could not replace the coal-fired power station ?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Solution :
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           (a) Electrical energy produced by coal-fired plant = 2000MW = 2000x106W
           <br/>
           Electrical energy produced by wind turbine = 300kW = 300x103W
           <br/>
           No. of wind turbine required = 2000×106/300×103 = 6666.6
           <br/>
           So, 6667 wind turbines would be needed to replace the power station.
           <br/>
           (b) In actual practice, this no. of wind turbines could not replace the coal-fired power plant because the efficiency of wind turbines keeps changing due to changes in wind speed but the efficiency of steam turbines used in coal-fired power stations remains the same.

           <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Solution :
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Charcoal is prepared by burning wood in a limited supply of air, so that water and other volatile materials present in it get removed.

<br/>
           During high tide, when the level of water in the sea is high, sea-water flows into the reservoir of the barrage and turns the turbines. The turbines then turn the generator to produce the electricity. And during the low tide, when the level of sea-water is low, the sea-water stored in the barrage reservoir is allowed to flow out into the sea. This flowing water also turns the turbines and generates electricity.
           <br/>
           (b) Tidal energy is not likely to be a potential source of energy because there are very few sites around the world which are suitable for building tidal barrages, and the rise and fall of sea-water during high and low tides is not enough to generate electricity on a large scale.

<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Solution :
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Sea-waves energy can be harnessed by by the following ways:
           <br/>
           1. By setting up floating generators in the sea which would move up and down with the sea-waves and their movement would drive the generators to produce electricity.
           <br/>
           2. By letting the sea-waves move up and down inside large tubes so that when the waves move up, the air in the tubes is compressed and this compressed air can then be used to turn a turbine of a generator to produce electricity.

           What is meant by ocean thermal energy ? Explain how ocean thermal energy can be used to generate electricity.
           <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Solution :
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           The energy available due to the difference in the temperature of water at the upper surface and the deeper layers of ocean is known as ocean thermal energy.
           <br/>
           Ocean thermal energy is used to generate electricity in an Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion power plant (OTEC power plant). A temperature difference of 20oC or more between the surface water and deeper water is needed for the operation of these plants. The warm surface water of ocean is used to boil a liquid like ammonia or chlorofluorocarbon. The high pressure of liquid vapours is used to turn the turbine of a generator and produce electricity.

<strong>
             Solution :
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Limitations of energy that can be harnessed from the sea:
           <br/>
           1. There are very few sites around the world which are suitable for building tidal barrage for harnessing tidal energy. Moreover, the rise and fall of sea-water during high and low tides is not enough to generate electricity on a large scale.
           <br/>
           2. The harnessing of sea-waves energy is a viable proposition only at those places where sea-waves are very strong.
           <br/>
           3. Though the energy potential from the sea is very large but its large scale exploitation is difficult at the moment.

           A biogas plant consists of a wall-shaped, underground tank called digester, which is made of bricks, and has a dome shaped roof D. The dome acts as a gas-holder. There is a gas outlet S at the top of the dome having a valve V. There is a sloping inlet chamber I connected to a mixing tank M and a rectangular outlet chamber O connected to the overflow tank F.
           <br/>
           Cow dung and water are mixed in equal proportions in the mixing tank M to prepare the slurry. This slurry is fed into the digester tank through the inlet chamber I to fill the tank upto the cylindrical level. Then, the cow-dung undergoes anaerobic degradation with the evolution of biogas which collects in the dome. The pressure of biogas on the slurry forces the spent slurry to go into the overflow tank F through outlet chamber O, from where it is removed.

<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Solution :
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           (a) Geothermal energy is the heat energy from hot rocks present inside the earth.
           <br/>
           (b) Hot rocks present inside the earth are the source of heat contained in geothermal energy.
           <br/>
           (c) Extremely hot rocks present below the surface of earth heat the underground water and turn it into steam. As more and more steam is formed between the rocks, it gets compressed to high pressures. This high pressure steam is brought up through pipes and is used to run the turbine of a generator to produce electricity.

           (d) Advantage of geothermal energy:
           <br/>
           (i) It is very economical to use.
           <br/>
           (ii) It does not cause any pollution.
           <br/>
           (e) Disadvantage of geo thermal energy:-

           The process in which the heavy nucleus of a radioactive atom(such as uranium) splits up into smaller nuclei when bombarded with low energy neutrons, is called nuclear fission.
           <br/>
           E.g., When uranium-235 atoms are bombarded with slow moving neutrons, the heavy uranium nucleus breaks up to produce two medium-weighted atoms and 3 neutrons, with the emission of tremendous amount of energy.

</strong>
</span>
           (a) The process in which two nuclei of light elements (like that of hydrogen) combine to form a heavy nucleus (like that of helium), is called nuclear fusion.
           <br/>
           When deuterium atoms are heated to an extremely high temperature under extremely high pressure, then two deuterium nuclei combine together to form a heavy nucleus of helium, and a neutron is emitted. A tremendous amount of energy is liberated in the process.

           In a nuclear power plant, the fission of uranium-235 is carried out in a reactor R. Uranium-235 rods are inserted in a graphite core which acts as a moderator to slow down the neutrons. Boron rods B absorb excess neutrons and controls the rate of reaction. Liquid sodium or carbon dioxide gas, which is pumped continuously through pipes embedded in reactor by using a pump P, is used as a ‘coolant’ to transfer the heat produced to heat exchanger for converting water into steam. The hot steam at high pressure goes into a turbine chamber and makes the turbine rotate. The shaft of the generator also rotates and drives a generator connected to it.

             Question 49:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           A nuclear power plant is working normally. What would you do if the reactor core suddenly got too hot ?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Solution :
            </strong>

<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Solution :
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           The control rods should be withdrawn a little more from inside the reactor. This will increase the rate of nuclear fission process and hence more heat.

<br/>
           Explain why, in a nuclear reactor, the chain reaction stops if the control rods are fully inserted into the graphite.
           <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Solution :
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           The control rods absorb all the neutrons, stopping the nuclear chain reaction.
