<p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Atul and Neera were partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio of 3 : 2. They admitted Mitali as a new partner. Goodwill of the firm was valued at ₹ 2,00,000. Mitali brings her share of goodwill premium of ₹ 20,000 in cash, which is entirely credited to Atul’s capital account. Calculate the new profit sharing ratio. (Delhi 2019)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Firms goodwill = ₹ 2,00,000
           <br/>
           Premium for goodwill brought in by new partner Mitali = ₹ 20000
           <br/>
           So, Mitali s share = \(\frac { 20000 }{ 200000 }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ 10 }\)
           <br/>
           Premium for goodwill is entirely credited to Atul’s capital account means only Atul sacrifice.
           <br/>
           So, Arid’s sacrificing ratio = \(\frac { 1 }{ 10 }\)
           <br/>
           ∴ Atuls new share = \(\frac{3}{5}-\frac{1}{10}=\frac{6-1}{10}=\frac{5}{10}\)
           <br/>
           Neera’s new share = \(\frac{2}{5} \times \frac{2}{2}=\frac{4}{10}\)
           <br/>
           Mitali’s new share = \(\frac { 1 }{ 10 }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ 10 }\)
           <br/>
           New Ratio = 5 : 4 : 1

           Amit and Beena were partners in a firm sharing profits and losses in the ratio of 3 : 1 Chaman was admitted as a new partner for \(\frac { 2 }{ 5 }\)th share in the period. Chaman acquired \(\frac { 2 }{ 5 }\)th of his share from Amit. How much share did Chaman acquire from Beena? (CBSE 2018)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Chaman’s share = \(\frac { 1 }{ 6 }\)
           <br/>
           Share acquired from Amit = \(\frac{2}{5} \times \frac{1}{6}=\frac{2}{30}\)
           <br/>
           Share acquired from Beena = Chaman’s share – Share acquired from Amit
           <br/>
           Share acquired from Beena = \(\frac{1}{6}-\frac{2}{30}=\frac{5-2}{30}=\frac{3}{30}\)

           <br/>
           Calculation of B’s Sacrifice

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Old ratio between Rajeev and Sanjeev = 3 : 2
           <br/>
<img alt="Reconstitution of Partnership Firm Admission of a Partner Class 12 Important Questions and Answers Accountancy Chapter 3 Img 6" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-147578" height="232" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Reconstitution-of-Partnership-Firm-Admission-of-a-Partner-Class-12-Important-Questions-and-Answers-Accountancy-Chapter-3-Img-6.png" width="293"/>
</p>
<p>
           (ii) Old ratio between Anita and Sunita = 3 : 2
           <br/>
           Vinita is admitted for \(\frac { 1 }{ 4}\)th share.
           <br/>
           Remaining share = 1 – \(\frac { 1 }{ 4}\) = \(\frac { 3 }{ 4}\) which will be
           <br/>
           shared among Anita and Sunita in the ratio of 2 : 1. Accordingly,
           <br/>
           Anita’s new share = \(\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{2}{3}=\frac{2}{4}\)
           <br/>
           Sunita’s new share = \(\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{1}{3}=\frac{1}{4}\)
           <br/>
           ∴ New profit sharing ratio = 2 : 1 : 1
           <br/>
           Sacrificing Ratio = Old Share – New Share
           <br/>
           Anita = \(\frac{3}{5}-\frac{2}{4}=\frac{12-10}{20}=\frac{2}{20}\)
           <br/>
           Sunita = \(\frac{2}{5}-\frac{1}{4}=\frac{8-5}{20}=\frac{3}{20}\)
           <br/>
           ∴ Sacrificing ratio = 2 : 3

           Question 20.
           <br/>
           (i) Rohan and Mohan are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio of 5 : 3 respectively. They admit Bhim as a partner for \(\frac { 1 }{ 7}\)th share in the profit. The new profit sharing ratio will be 4 : 2 : 1. Calculate the sacrificing ratio of Rohan and Mohan.
           <br/>
           (ii) Amla and Kamla are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio of 4 : 1 respectively. They admitted Bimla as a new partner for \(\frac { 1 }{ 4}\)th share in the
           <br/>
           profits, which she acquired wholly from Amla. Determine the new profit sharing ratio of the partners. (Delhi (C) 2014)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Old ratio between Rohan and Mohan = 5 : 3
           <br/>
           New ratio after Bhim’s admission = 4 : 2 : 1
           <br/>
           Sacrificing Ratio = Old Share – New Share
           <br/>
           Rohan = \(\frac{5}{8}-\frac{4}{7}=\frac{35-32}{56}=\frac{3}{56}\)
           <br/>
           Mohan = \(\frac{3}{8}-\frac{2}{7}=\frac{21-16}{56}=\frac{5}{56}\)
           <br/>
           ∴ Sacrificing ratio = 3 : 5
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Old ratio between Amla and Kamla = 4 : 1
           <br/>
           Bimla is admitted for \(\frac { 1 }{ 4}\)th share, which she gets wholly from Amla. Accordingly,
           <br/>
           New share of Amla = \(\frac{4}{5}-\frac{1}{4}=\frac{16-5}{20}=\frac{11}{20}\)
           <br/>
           Share of Kamla = \(\frac { 1 }{ 5}\); Share of Bimla = \(\frac { 1 }{ 4}\)
           <br/>
           ∴ New ratio = \(\frac{11}{20}: \frac{1}{5}: \frac{1}{4}\) = 11 : 4 : 5

           Question 21.
           <br/>
           On 1st April, 2010 Sahil and Charu entered into partnership for sharing profits in the ratio of 4 : 3. They admitted Tanu as a new partner on 1st April, 2012 for \(\frac { 1 }{ 5}\)th share which she acquired equally from Sahil and Charu. Sahil, Charu and Tanu earned profits at a higher rate than the normal rate of return for the year ended 31st March, 2013. Therefore, they decided to expand their business. To meet the requirements of additional capital they admitted Puneet as a new partner on 1st April, 2013 for \(\frac { 1 }{ 7}\)th share in profits which he acquired from Sahil and Charu in 7 : 3 ratio. Calculate
           <br/>
           (i) New profit sharing ratio of Sahil, Charu and TanuTor the year 2012-13.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Calculation of New Profit Sharing Ratio of Sahil, Charu and Tanu for the year 2012-13
           <br/>
           Tanu is admitted for \(\frac { 1 }{ 5}\) th share
           <br/>
           Tanu acquired profit share from Sahil = \(\frac{1}{5} \times \frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{10}\)
           <br/>
           Tanu acquired profit share form Charu = \(\frac{1}{5} \times \frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{10}\)
           <br/>
           Sahil’s New Share = Old Share – Sacrifice Share
           <br/>
           = \(\frac{4}{7}-\frac{1}{10}=\frac{40-7}{70}=\frac{33}{70}\)
           <br/>
           New profit sharing ratio will be = \(\frac{33}{70}: \frac{23}{70} \div \frac{1}{5}\)
           <br/>
           = \(\frac { 33:23:14 }{ 70 }\) or 33 : 24 : 14
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Calculation of New Profit Sharing Ratio
           <br/>
           Old ratio = 33 : 23 : 14
           <br/>
           Puneet is admitted for \(\frac { 1 }{ 7 }\)th share
           <br/>
           Which he acquired from Sahil and Cham in 7 : 3 ratio
           <br/>
           Puneet acquired share from Sahil = \(\frac{1}{7} \times \frac{7}{10}=\frac{7}{70}\)
           <br/>
           Puneet acquired share from Charu = \(\frac{1}{7} \times \frac{3}{10}=\frac{3}{70}\)
           <br/>
           Sahil s new share = \(\frac{33}{70}-\frac{7}{70}=\frac{26}{70}\)
           <br/>
           Charu’s new share = \(\frac{23}{70}-\frac{3}{70}=\frac{20}{70}\)
           <br/>
           New Ratio = \(\frac{26}{70}: \frac{20}{70}: \frac{14}{70}: \frac{1}{7}\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ \(\frac{26}{70}: \frac{20}{70}: \frac{14}{70}: \frac{10}{70}\)

           Question 22.
           <br/>
           Vinay and Naman are partners sharing profit in the ratio of 4 : 1. Their capitals were ₹ 90,000 and ₹ 70,000 respectively. They admitted Prateek for 1/3 share in the profits. Prateek brought ₹ 1,00,000 as his capital. Calculate the value of firm’s goodwill. Compartment 2tn8
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Prateek’s Capital for – share = ₹ 1,00,000
           <br/>
           Firm’s Total Capital = 1,00,000 × 3 = ₹ 3,00,000
           <br/>
           On the basis of Prateek’s Capital,
           <br/>
           Firm Actual Capital = 90000 + 70000 + 100000 = ₹ 2,60,000
           <br/>
           Firm’s goodwill = 300000 – 2,60000 = ₹ 40,000
          </p>
<p>
           Question 23.
           <br/>
           A, B, C and D were partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio of 4 : 3 : 2 : 1. On 1st January, 2015, they admitted E as a new partner for \(\frac { 1 }{ 10 }\)th share in the profits. E brought ₹ 10,000 for his share of goodwill premium which was correctly recorded in the books by the accountant. The accountant showed goodwill at ₹ 1,00,000 in the books. Was the accountant correct in doing so? Give reason in support of your answer. (Delhi 2015)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           No, the accountant is not correct because according to AS-26, internally generated goodwill shall not be recognised as an asset because it is not an identifiable resource controlled by the entity that can be measured reliably at cost.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 24.
           <br/>
           When the new partner brings cash for goodwill, the amount is credited to which account? (Delhi (C) 2015)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When the new partner brings cash for goodwill, the amount is credited to premium for goodwill account.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 25.
           <br/>
           Under what circumstances will the premium for goodwill paid by the incoming partner not be recorded in the books of accounts? (Delhi (C) 2014)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When the incoming partner pays his share of goodwill privately to the sacrificing partners, outside the business, then no entry is passed in the books of the firm.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 26.
           <br/>
           State the need for treatment of goodwill on admission of a partner. (Delhi 2010)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When a new partner is admitted, his share in future profits of the firm is equal to the sacrifice of profit by an existing partner or partners of the firm. The amount he pays to compensate this sacrifice, is in the form of goodwill. Therefore, it is important to treat goodwill at the time of admission of a partner.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 27.
           <br/>
           A, B, C and D were partners in a firm sharing profits and losses equally. E was admitted as a new partner for \(\frac { 1 }{ 3 }\)rd share in the profits of the firm which he acquires equally from C and 3 D. On E’s admission the goodwill of the firm was valued at ₹ 3,00,000. Calculate the new profit sharing ratio on E’s admission. Also pass necessary journal entry on E’s admission, assuming that he failed to bring his share of goodwill in cash. (All India 2019)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           E’s Share = \(\frac { 1 }{ 3 }\)rd which he acquires equally from C and D.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           5 Years Average Profit = \(\frac{4,00,000+3,00,000+2,00,000+50,000+(50,000)}{5}\) = ₹ 108000

</p>
<p>
           The normal rate of return is 12% per annum. Average profit of the firm for the last four years was ₹ 30,000. Calculate Saurabh’s share of goodwill. (comportment 2018)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Capital Employed = Amit’s Capital + Kartik’s Capital + Reserve = 90000 + 50000 + 20000 = ₹ 1,60,000
           <br/>
           2 12 f Normal Profit = Capital Employed x Normal Rate of Return = 100000 × \(\frac { 12 }{ 100 }\) = ₹ 19,200
           <br/>
           Average Profit = ₹ 30,000
           <br/>
           Super Profit = Average Profit – Normal Profit = 30000 – 19200 = ₹ 10,800
           <br/>
           Firms Goodwill = Super Profit x Number of Years Purchase = 10000 x 4 = ₹ 43,200
           <br/>
           Saurabh’s Share of Goodwill = 43200 x \(\frac { 1 }{ 3 }\) = ₹ 14,400

           <br/>
           2014- 15 4,75,000 – 56,250 = 4,18,750
           <br/>
           2015- 16 6,70,000 – 56,250 = 6,13,750
           <br/>
           2016- 17 7,45,000 – 56,250 – 15,000 = 6,73,750

           1. Calculation of Ajay’s Share of Goodwill
           <br/>
           (a) New firm’s capital on the basis of Ajay’s capital and his profit share = 5,00,000 x \(\frac { 5 }{ 1 }\) = ₹ 25,00,000

<br/>
           Working Note:
           <br/>
           Average profit = \(\frac{10,000+7,000+8,500+7,500}{4}\) = ₹ 8,250
           <br/>
           Goodwill = Average Profit x Number of Years’ Purchase
           <br/>
           = 8,250 x 2.5
           <br/>
           = ₹ 20,625
           <br/>
           B’s share = 20,625 x \(\frac { 4 }{ 15 }\) = ₹ 5,500 which will be distributed among W and R in their sacrificing ratio, i.e. 3 : 2.

           1. Calculation of Sacrificing Ratio
           <br/>
           Sacrificing Ratio = Old Share – New Share
           <br/>
           Abha = \(\frac{3}{5}-\frac{5}{10}=\frac{6-5}{10}=\frac{1}{10}\), Bimal = \(\frac{2}{5}-\frac{3}{10}=\frac{4-3}{10}=\frac{1}{10}\)

           2. Calculation of New Capitals
           <br/>
           Chintu’s share = \(\frac { 1 }{ 5 }\)
           <br/>
           Capital brought in by Chintu for \(\frac { 1 }{ 5 }\)th share = ₹ 80,000
           <br/>
           Finn’s capital = 80,000 x \(\frac { 5 }{ 1 }\) = ₹ 4,00,000
           <br/>
           Abha’s capital = 4,00,000 x \(\frac { 5 }{ 10 }\) = ₹ 2,00,000
           <br/>
           Banal’s capital = 4,00,000 x \(\frac { 3 }{ 10 }\) = ₹ 1,20,000
           <br/>

<br/>
           Working Notes
           <br/>
           1. Firm’s goodwill = ₹ 4,00,000
           <br/>
           Nidhi’s share of goodwill = 4,00,000 x \(\frac { 1 }{ 4 }\) = ₹ 1,00,000 to be distributed among Sanjana and Alok in sacrificing ratio.
          </p>
<p>
           2. Sanjana’s capital after adjustment = ₹ 5,90,000
           <br/>
           Alok’s capital after adjustment = ₹ 1,60,000
           <br/>
           = ₹ 7,50,000
           <br/>
           to be in profit sharing ratio
           <br/>
           Sanjana = 7,50,000 x \(\frac { 3 }{ 5 }\) = 4,50,000 – 5,90,000 = ₹ 1,40,000 cash withdrew
           <br/>
           Alok = 7,50,000 x \(\frac { 2 }{ 5 }\) = 3,00,000 – 1,60,000 = ₹ 1,40,000 cash brought in

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Working Notes:
           <br/>
           1. Calculation of Sacrificing Ratio
           <br/>
           A sacrifice = \(\frac{3}{5}-\frac{5}{10}=\frac{6-5}{10}=\frac{1}{10}\); B sacrifice = \(\frac{2}{5}-\frac{3}{10}=\frac{4-3}{10}=\frac{1}{10}\)
           <br/>
           Sacrificing ratio = 1 : 1
          </p>
<p>
           2. \(\frac { 2 }{ 10 }\)th share capital = ₹ 64,000
           <br/>
           Firm’s capital = 64,000 x \(\frac { 10 }{ 2 }\) = ₹ 3,20,000
           <br/>
           A’s new capital = 3,20,000 × \(\frac { 5 }{ 10 }\) = ₹ 1,60,000
           <br/>
           B’s new capital = 3,20,000 × \(\frac { 3 }{ 10 }\) = ₹ 96,000
