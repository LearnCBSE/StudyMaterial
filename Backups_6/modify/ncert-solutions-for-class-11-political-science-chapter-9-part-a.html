           <br/>
           (c) Judiciary has defined which aspects of the Constitution can be termed as the basic structure and which cannot.
           <br/>

           <br/>
           (e) This theory has increased the powers of the judiciary and has come to be accepted by different political parties and the government.
           <br/>
           Answer:

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Special majority is required in the different manner:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Half of the total strength of the house, who are in favour of the amendment bill.
           </li>
<li>
            Two-third of those supporters who participate in voting.
           </li>
<li>
            Both the houses of parliament must pass the bill separately also.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           The above mentioned majorities are required because:
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<ul>
<li>
            To take some opposition parties into confidence due to majority.
           </li>
<li>
            On the issues of distribution of powers, some articles are needed to be consulted with the states.
           </li>
<li>
            Through wide consensus and limited participation of states, constitution can be amended.
           </li>
<li>
            To maintain partial flexibility and rigidity, consent of half of the states and simple majority of state legislature is sufficient.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Many amendments to the Constitution of India have been made due to different interpretations upheld by the Judiciary and the Parliament. Explain with examples.
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            The first amendment act of 1951, made changes in the constitution due to some flows in the working of constitution and those were to be remedied.
           </li>
<li>
            Under Article 19, Right to Freedom of speech and expression was held by some courts to be very comprehensive, not to take any action against any individual.
           </li>
<li>
            Many laws made on abolition of Zamindari System were declared Ultra Vires by courts, hence, constitution was amended.
           </li>
<li>
            In the case of Keshavananda Bharti, Parliament’s power to amend the constitution was checked and limited them by instructing not to violate the basic structure of constitution as well as parliament can amend if clashes arise between the judiciary and the government.
           </li>
<li>
            In 1971, by 24th amendment parliament got the power to amend the constitution including the fundamental rights.
           </li>
<li>
            42nd amendment (1976) was most controversial as amendment were made in the background of internal emergency as well as imposed some restrictions on the power of judicial review of the court.
           </li>
<li>
            44th amendments cancelled most of the changes which were affected by 38th, 39th, 42nd amendments, i.e. changes in Preamble to the seventh schedule, other 53 Articles, etc.
           </li>
<li>
            Sometimes, judicial interpretations also changed the understanding of constitution, i. e. the supreme court had held that reservation in jobs and educational institutions must not exceed 50% of the total seats.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Question 10.
           <br/>
           If amending power is with the elected representatives, judiciary should NOT have the power to decide the validity of amendments. Do you agree? Give your reasons in 100 words.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           No, I don’t agree on the view because:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            During the period of 1970-1980, whatsoever amendments were made, these created a legal and political controversy, only interference of judiciary tackled them.
           </li>
<li>
            During the period 1971-1976, the ruling party attempted to subvert the constitution by 42nd amendment Act. Again, judiciary intervened and protected the basic structure of the constitution.
           </li>
<li>
            A constitutional legal issue raises the question on the supremacy of parliament but the constitution has given the powers to every organ of government, hence, judiciary enjoys the power to decide the validity of amendments.

           Passage 1.
           <br/>
           Read the passage NCERT Textbook, page 204) given below carefully and answer the questions that follow:
          </p>
<p>
           For some articles of the Constitution, special majority is not sufficient. When an amendment aims to modify an article related to distribution of powers between the States and the central government, or articles related to representation, it is necessary that the States must be consulted and that they give their consent. We have studied the federal nature of the Constitution. Federalism means that powers of the States must not be at the mercy of the central government. The Constitution has ensured this by providing that legislatures of half the States have to pass the amendment bill before the amendment comes into effect. Apart from the provisions related to federal structure, provisions about fundamental rights are also protected in this way. We can say that for some parts of the Constitution, greater or wider consensus in the polity is expected. This provision also respects the States and gives them participation in the process of amendment. At the same time, care is taken to keep this procedure somewhat flexible even in its more rigid format: consent of only half the States is required and simple majority of the State legislature is sufficient. Thus, the amendment process is not impracticable even after taking into consideration this more stringent condition.

          </p>
<p>
           A number of amendments are a product of different interpretations of the Constitution given by the judiciary and the government of the day. When these clashed, the Parliament had to insert an amendment underlining one particular interpretation as the authentic one. It is a part of the democratic politics that various institutions would interpret the Constitution and particularly the scope of their own powers in a different manner. Many times, the Parliament did not agree with the judicial interpretation and therefore, sought to amend the Constitution to overcome the ruling of the judiciary. In the period between 1970 and 1975 this situation arose frequently.

           <br/>
           1. Amendments are the products of different interpretations of the Constitution given by the judiciary and the government of the day.
