<br/>
           (a) Buckminsterfullerene is an allotrope of carbon containing clusters of 60 carbon atoms joined together to form spherical molecules. It burns on heating to form carbon dioxide and nothing is left behind. This shows that it is made up of carbon only like diamond and graphite.
           <br/>
           (b) Diamond used for making cutting tools but graphite is not because diamond is a very hard substance and graphite is a soft substance.
           <br/>
           (c) Graphite is used for making dry cell electrodes but diamond is not b ecause graphite is a good conductor of electricity whereas diamond is a bad conductor of electricity.

             Question 29:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Catenation is the ability of an atom to form bonds with other atoms of the same element. It is exhibited by both carbon and silicon. Compare the ability of catenation of the two elements. Give reasons.
           <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Solution :
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Carbon forms strong bonds among themselves and with other elements and this makes the carbon compounds stable whereas silicon shows catenation property due to which it forms compounds with hydrogen having chains of up to 7 or 8 silicon atoms; but due to weak bonds, these compounds are unstable.

<strong>
             Solution :
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           (a)Diamonds can be made artificially by subjecting pure carbon to very high
           <br/>
           pressure and temperature. The synthetic diamonds are small whereas natural
           <br/>
           diamonds are big.

           (b)(i) Diamond is hard whereas graphite is soft.
           <br/>
           (ii)Diamond is a non-conductor of electricity whereas graphite is a good conductor of electricity. The difference in the physical properties of diamond and graphite arises because
           <br/>
           of the different arrangements of carbon atoms in them.

<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Solution :
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           (a) The most unique property of carbon atom is its ability to combine itself, atom to atom to form long chains. This property of self combination is useful to us because it gives rise to an extremely large number of carbon compounds (or organic compounds).
           <br/>
           (b) A diamond crystal is a giant molecule of carbon atoms. Each carbon atom in the diamond crystal is linked to four other carbon atoms by strong covalent bonds. The four surrounding atoms are at the four vertices of a regular tetrahedron. This rigid structure of diamond makes it a very hard substance.
           <br/>
           The structure of graphite is very different from that of diamond. A graphite crystal consists of layers of carbon atoms or sheets of carbon atoms and these layers are held together by weak Van der Waals forces. Due to this sheet like structure, graphite is a comparatively soft substance.

           (c) When a candle is lighted, the wax melts, rises up the wick and gets converted into vapours. In a candle, there is no provision for the proper mixing of oxygen (of air) for burning wax vapours. So, the wax vapours bum in an insufficient supply of oxygen (of air) which leads to incomplete combustion of wax. This incomplete combustion of wax produces small unburnt carbon particles. These solid carbon particles rise in the flame, get heated and glow to give out yellowish light. This makes the candle flame yellow and luminous.

<strong>
             Solution :

<br/>
           Ethene decolourises bromine water because ethene is an alkene. And all alkenes and alkynes are unsaturated compounds which decolourise bromine water. On the other hand, ethane being an alkane is a saturated compound which does not decolourise bromine water.

<br/>
           Litmus test: Some blue litmus solution is added to the organic compound (to be tested). If the blue litmus solution turns red, it shows that the organic compound is acidic in nature and hence it is a carboxylic acid.

<strong>
             Solution :

<br/>
           (b) Red litmus paper turns blue in soap solution and no change occurs on blue litmus paper because soap is basic in nature.
           <br/>
           (c) Denatured alcohol is ethyl alcohol which has been made unfit for drinking purposes by adding small amounts of poisonous substances like methanol, pyridine, copper sulphate etc. This is done to prevent the misuse of industrial alcohol for drinking purposes or black marketing (as it is supplied duty free for industrial purposes by the government).

<strong>
             Solution :

</span>
<br/>
           (a) Sodium metal test: Add a small piece of sodium metal to the organic liquid (to be tested), taken in a dry test tube. If bubbles (or effervescence) of hydrogen gas are produced, it indicates that the given organic liquid is an alcohol.
           <br/>
           (b) Harmful effects of drinking alcohol:
           <br/>
           (i) Alcohol slows down the activity of the nervous system and brain due to which the judgement of a person is impaired and his reaction becomes slow.
           <br/>
           (ii) Heavy drinking of alcohol on a particular occasion leads to staggered movement, slurred speech and vomiting.
           <br/>
           (c) Unlike ethanol, drinking methanol, even in a small quantity can be fatal leading to permanent blindness and even death. Methanol damages the optic nerve causing permanent blindness in a person. This happens because methanol is oxidised to methanal in the liver of a person. This methanal reacts rapidly with the components of the cell causing coagulation of their protoplasm. Due to this, the cells stop functioning normally.

<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Solution :
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           (a) Air holes of a gas burner have to be adjusted b ecause blackening of vessels show that the air holes of the gas stove are getting blocked and hence the fuel is not burning completely (due to insufficient supply of oxygen).
           <br/>
           (b) Some of the detergents (synthetic) are not bio-degradable, that is they cannot be decomposed by micro organisms like bacteria and hence cause water pollution.

<br/>
           (a) On adding 5% alkaline potassium permanganate solution drop by drop to some warm ethanol, we would observe that the purple color of potassium permanganate starts disappearing; the product formed by this process; ethanoic acid can turn blue litmus red.

             Question 35:

</span>
<br/>
           (a) Explain the process of preparation of soap in laboratory.
           <br/>
           (b) Why is common salt (sodium chloride) added during the preparation of soap ?
           <br/>
           (c) Why is soap not suitable for washing clothes when the water is hard ?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Solution :
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           (a) Soap can be prepared in the laboratory as follows:
           <br/>
           1. Take about 20 ml of castor oil (cottonseed oil, linseed oil or soya bean oil) in a beaker.
           <br/>
           2. Add 30 ml of 20% sodium hydroxide solution to it.
           <br/>
           3. Heat the mixture with constant stirring till a paste of soap is formed.
           <br/>
           4. Then add 5 to 10 grams of common salt (sodium chloride).
           <br/>
           5. Stir the mixture well and allow it to cool. On cooling the solution, solid soap separates out.
           <br/>
           6. When the soap sets, it can be cut into pieces called ‘soap bars’.
           <br/>
           (b) Common salt is added to the mixture to make the soap come out of solution. Though most of the soap separates out on its own but some of it remains in solution. Common salt is added to precipitate out all the soap from the aqueous solution.
           <br/>
           (c) When soap is used for washing clothes with hard water, a large amount of soap in water is reacting with the calcium and magnesium ions of hard water to form an insoluble precipitate called scum, before it can be used for the real purpose of washing.

<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Solution :
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           (a) (i) Single bond: Methane, CH
           <sub>
            4
           </sub>
           . They are quite unreactive hence they undergo substitution reaction with chlorine in presence of sunlight.

           </sub>
           . They undergo addition reaction in the presence of a catalyst like nickel or palladium.
           <br/>
           (b) A detergent is the sodium salt of long chain benzene sulphonic acid which has cleansing properties in water. Ex: Sodium n-dodecyl benzene sulphonate.
           <br/>
           (c) Detergents are better cleansing agents than soaps because they do not form insoluble calcium and magnesium salts with hard water, and hence can be used for washing even with hard water.

<br/>
           Activity: Take a boiling tube and put about 0.5 g of sodium carbonate in it. Add 2 ml of dilute ethanoic acid to the boiling tube (through a thistle funnel). We will observe that brisk effervescence of carbon dioxide gas is produced. Let us pass this gas through lime water taken in a test tube. We will find that lime water turns milky. Only carbon dioxide gas can turn lime water milky. So, this experiment proves that when ethanoic acid reacts with sodium carbonate, then carbon dioxide gas is evolved.

<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Solution :
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           (a) A soap is the sodium salt (or potassium salt) of a long chain carboxylic acid (fatty acid) which has cleansing properties in water.
           <br/>

<br/>
           (b) A soap molecule has two parts: the long chain organic part and the ionic part containing the -COO
           <sup>
            –
           </sup>

           group. It has to be remembered that this is not an ion, the atoms are all covalently bonded, the electrical charges show how the charges get polarized in the group. A soap molecule has a tadpole like structure shown below:
           <br/>
           (c) Cleaning action of soap has been explained with the help of the image below:
           <br/>
           Soaps are molecules in which the two ends have differing properties, one is hydrophilic, that is it dissolves in water, while the other end is hydrophobic, that is it dissolves in hydrocarbons. When soap is at the surface of water, the hydrophobic ‘tail’ of soap will not be soluble in water and the soap will align along the surface of water with the ionic end in water and the hydrocarbon ‘tail’ protruding out of water.
           <br/>
<img alt="Carbon-And-Its-Compounds-Lakhmir-Singh-class-10-Chemistry-Solutions-49-3-1" height="160" loading="lazy" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7611/16692049088_0267e2bd2a_o.png" width="355"/>
<br/>
           Inside water, these molecules have a unique orientation that keeps the hydrocarbon portion inside the water. This is achieved by forming clusters of molecules in which the hydrophobic tails are in the interior of the cluster and the ionic ends are on the surface of the cluster. This formation is called a micelle. When a dirty cloth is put in water containing dissolved soap, then soap in the form of a micelle is able to clean. The hydrocarbon ends of the soap attach to the oily dirt particles and entrap them at the centre of the micelle. the ionic ends in the micelles remain attached to water. When the dirty cloth is agitated in soap solution, the oily dirt particles entrapped by soap micelles get dispersed in water and the cloth gets cleaned.
