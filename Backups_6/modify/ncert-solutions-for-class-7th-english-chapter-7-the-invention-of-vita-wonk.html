</span>
<br/>
           Can anyone’s age be a minus number? What does ‘minus 87’ mean?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           No, age cannot be in minus because we all start growing up from the moment we are born. ‘Minus 87’ means the man is 87 years back to his actual age.

            </strong>
</span>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
            What trees does Mr Wonka mention? Which tree does he say lives the longest?
           </li>
<li>
            How long does this tree live? Where can you find it?
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:

</span>
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<ol>
<li>
            Mr Wonka mentions fir, oak, cedar and Bristlecone pine trees lives the longest.
           </li>
<li>
            Bristlecone pine lives for over 4000 years and one can find them upon the slopes of Wheeler Peak in Nevada, USA.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Question 2:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           How many of the oldest living things can you remember from Mr Wonka’s list? (Don’t look back at the story!) Do you think all these things really exist, or are some of them purely imaginary?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Mr Wonka has mentioned some very oldest things.
           <br/>
           He said he had collected a pint a pint of sap from a 4000 years Bristlecone pine tree, toe-nail clippings from a 168 years old Russian Farmer, an egg laid by a 200 years old tortoise, the tail of 51 years old horse, whiskers of a 36 years old cat called Crumpets, a flea that lived on Crumpets for 36 years, tail of a 207 years old rat, the black teeth of a 97 years old Grimalkin and knucklebones of a 700 years old Cattaloo.
           <br/>
           Very few of these things would have really existed, a majority of them are purely imaginary.
          </p>
<p>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Question 3:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Why does Mr Wonka collect items from the oldest things? Do you think this is the right way to begin his invention?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Mr Wonka wanted to create an item that will make people older so he collected items from the oldest things. This is in fact a foolish way to begin an invention.
          </p>
<p>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Question 4:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           What happens to the volunteer who swallows four drops of the new invention? What is the name of the invention?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           The Oompa-Loompa volunteers was 20 years old before swallowing the drops, he became 75 years old after it. The invention is name Vita-Wonk.

            <br/>
            It is found in abundance in Northern America with over 90 species found in United States and 160 in Mexico. Oak wood has a wide application because of its resistance to fungal and insect attack.

            Cedar trees are found in abundance all across the world. Cedar woods have a wide application like used to make pencils. Australian red cedar is highly valued and is used for making furniture and shipbuilding.

<strong>
             Question 2:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<strong>
            Find out something interesting about age or growing old and write a paragraph about it. Following are a few topics as suggested as examples.
           </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
            The age profile of a country’s population- does it have more young people than old people or vice versa? What are the consequences of this?
           </li>
<li>
            How can we tell how old a tree, a horse, or a rock is?
           </li>
<li>
            What is the ‘life expectancy’ of various living things and various population (how long can they reasonably expect to live)?
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           All living beings start ageing from the moment they are born. The best part with the process of growing old is that we are able to witness many changes. India is one of the most populous nations in the world. In India we have more of youth population than old people.
           <br/>
           It increases the productivity and earning capacity in the society. We can guess the age of a tree by counting the rings in its trunk. The age of rock and horse can be identified by carbon dating process. Microorganisms have the shortest life cycle.
           <br/>
           Insects too live a short life. Animals like elephant and tortoise live more than 100 years. Life expectancy of human is around 85 years.

<strong>
             Question 1:

<strong>

           Vita-Wonk had gone wrong. After taking it many people have grown younger to an extent that their ages have gone in minus. All such people have disappeared and will be back only after they spend all those minus years being invisible. To alter these changes Mr Wonka decided to invent a new drug which will help people to grow older.

<br/>
           Mr Willy Wonka was a strange man. He used to make all strange inventions. He had a subordinate called Charlie. There was Oompa- Loompa volunteers on whom he used to carry out the testing of his inventions.
           <br/>
           He had an Inventing Room where he carried out all such mysterious works.
           <br/>
           He had earlier invented Wonka-Vite that had made people younger to an extent that their ages have gone into minus and they have become invisible.
           <br/>
           He then invented Vita-Wonk after collecting ancient items from across the world which could help people grow older.

            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Describe the process of invention of Vita-Wonk.
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Mr Willy Wonka travelled across the globe in his Great Glass Elevator to collect items for Vita-Wonk. He collected samples from some of the oldest living creatures in the world. He mixed these items, boiled and bubbled them several times in his inventing room and then invented a one tiny cupful of an oily black liquid. He tested this on a 20 years old Oompa-Loompa volunteer and within minutes it turned into a 75 years old creature. This was how Vita-Wonk was discovered.

           <br/>
           “All over the world, Charlie,” Mr Wonka went on
           <br/>
           “I tracked down very old and ancient animals and
           <br/>
           took an important little bit of something from each
           <br/>
           one of them—a hair or an eyebrow or sometimes it
           <br/>
           was no more than an ounce or two of the jam scraped
           <br/>
           from between its toes while it was sleeping. I tracked
           <br/>
           down the whistle-pig, the Bobolink, the skrock, the
           <br/>
           Pollyfrog, the Giant Curlicue, the Stinging Slug and
           <br/>
           the Venomous Squerkle who can spit poison right
           <br/>
           into your eye from fifty yards away. But there’s no
           <br/>
           time to tell you about them all now, Charlie.

<strong>
             Solution:

<br/>
           Mr Wonka tells Charlie that he had observed and studied many of very old and ancient animals and collected some parts of their bodies. But he didn’t have time to tell in detail about his expedition.
