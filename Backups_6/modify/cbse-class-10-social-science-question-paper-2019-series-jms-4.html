           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The English Government wanted to suppress the native press because the vernacular newspapers had become assertively nationalist. They feared that if their freedom of press is not curtailed, it might encourage the masses to rise again against the colonial rule.
           <br/>
           In 1878, the Vernacular Press Act was passed which provided the Government with extensive rights to censor reports and editorials in the vernacular press.

<p>
           Question 8.
           <br/>
           Describe the role of Romanticism in developing nationalist feelings among Europeans during nineteenth century. [1 × 3 = 3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Role played by romanticism in developing nationalist feelings among Europeans during nineteenth century.
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Role of culture was important in creating the idea of the nation. Art, poetry, music etc. helped in developing and expressing nationalist feelings. Romanticism was a cultural movement that led to the development of nationalist sentiment.
           </li>
<li>
            Romantic artists and poets criticized the glorification of reason and science and instead focussed on emotions and intuition.
           </li>
<li>
            Romantics such as the German philosopher Herder claimed that true German culture was to be discovered among the common people – das volk. It was through folk songs, folk poetry and folk dances that the true spirit of the nation was popularized.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Question 9.
           <br/>
           “Issue of caste discrimination began to be written about in many printed tracts and essays in India in the late nineteenth century.” Support the statement with two suitable examples. [1 × 3 = 3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Two examples:
           <br/>
           (i) Jyotiba Phule, the Maratha pioneer of ‘low caste’ protest movements, wrote about the injustices of the caste system in his Gulamgiri (1871). B.R. Ambedkar in Maharashtra and E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker in Madras, better known as Periyar, wrote powerfully on caste and their writings were read by people all over India.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) A mill worker at Kanpur called Kashibaba, wrote and published Chhote Aur Bade Ka Sawal in 1930 to show the links between caste and class exploitation. Bangalore Cotton Mill workers set up libraries to educate themselves following the example of Bombay workers.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 10.

           “Multi-purpose projects and large dams have been the cause of many new social movements.” Highlight the concerns related to such movements. [3 × 1 = 3]
           <br/>
           Or, “Traditional harvesting system is a useful system to conserve and store water.” Highlight the importance of this system with two examples. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Multi-purpose projects and large dams have been the cause of many new social movements like the ‘Narmada Bachao Andolan’ and the ‘Tehri Dam Andolan’, etc
           </li>
<li>
            Regulating and damming of rivers has affected their natural flow causing poor sediment flow. This has resulted in rockier stream beds.
           </li>
<li>
            Resistance to these projects has primarily been due to the large-scale displacement of local communities.
           </li>
<li>
            Local people often have had to give up their land, livelihood and their meager access and control over resources for the greater good of the nation.
           </li>
<li>
            Many settlements and agricultural lands are submerged under water.
           </li>
<li>
            The social landscape has been transformed. It has increased the gap between rich landowners and landless poor.
           </li>
<li>
            Dams have created conflicts between people wanting different uses and benefits from the same water resources.
           </li>
<li>
            In Gujarat, the Sabarmati basin farmers were agitated.
           </li>
<li>
            Inter-state water disputes are also becoming common with regard to the sharing of costs and benefits of these multipurpose projects.
            <br/>
            Or
            <br/>
            Water harvesting systems are considered safe both socio-economically and environ-mentally:
           </li>
<li>
            They help to fulfill the water needs of the people.
           </li>
<li>
            They help in irrigation and in recharging ground water.
           </li>
<li>
            They are reliable sources of drinking water when all other sources dry up.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Different rain water harvesting systems practised in India:
          </p>
<p>
           (i) In the semi-arid and arid regions of Rajasthan, all houses had underground tanks or tankas for storing drinking water. The tanks were connected to the sloping roofs of the houses through a pipe. Rain falling on the rooftops would travel down the pipe and was stored in these underground tankas.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) In the western Himalaya’s diversion channels called ‘guls’ or ‘kuls’ are built to utilize rain water for agriculture.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) In arid and semi-arid regions of Rajasthan agricultural fields were converted into rain fed storage structures. Rainwater was allowed to stand and moisten the soil. These structures are called ‘Khadins’ and ‘Johads’.

           Highlight any three differences between Kharif cropping season and Rabi cropping season. [3 × 1 = 3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Main features of ‘Rabi crop season’:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Rabi crops are sown in winter from October to December.
           </li>
<li>
            Harvested in Summer from April to June.
           </li>
<li>
            Important crops are wheat, barley, mustard, peas, gram etc.
           </li>
<li>
            Rabi crops are grown mainly in states from the north and north-western parts such as Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.
           </li>
<li>
            Climatic conditions: Availability of precipitation during winter months due to western temperate cyclones help in successful growth.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Main features of ‘Kharif crop season’:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Kharif crops are sown with the onset of monsoon (June-July).
           </li>
<li>
            These are harvested in September-October.
           </li>

           Question 12.
           <br/>
           Evaluate the strengths and limitations of local self-government in a democracy. [3 × 1 = 3]
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Evaluate the power sharing system in India. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Strengths:
           <br/>
           (i) Local self governments make it possible for the people at the local level to directly participate in decision making. This helps to inculcate a habit of democratic representation. Thus constitutional status for local government has helped to deepen democracy in our country.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Local self-governments also have helped to increase women’s voice and representation in our democracy.
          </p>
<p>
           Limitations:
           <br/>
           (i) While elections are held regularly and enthusiastically, Gram Sabhas are not held regularly.
           <br/>
           (ii) Most State Governments have not transferred significant powers to the Local Governments nor have they given them adequate resources.
           <br/>
           Or
          </p>
<p>
           It was believed for a long time that all power of a government must vest in one person or a group of persons located at one place to take quick decisions and enforce them. These notions have changed with the emergence of democracy because the principle of democracy is that ‘ people are the source of all political power. Therefore, with the emergence of democracy, it was felt that power should be distributed among as many citizens as possible. Power sharing has also emerged in opposition to the notion of undivided political power.
          </p>
<p>
           Forms of power-sharing:
          </p>
<p>
           (i) Power is shared among different organs of government, such as the legislature, f executive and judiciary. This is horizontal distribution of power because it allows s different organs of government, placed at the same level to exercise different ’ powers. A system of checks and balances ensures that in such a distribution none of the organs can exercise unlimited powers. Example: In India the judiciary has an independent status. The Supreme Court is the apex court of justice. The Parliament is the legislative body and the Executive is the implementing body.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Power can be shared among governments at different levels — a general government for the entire country and governments at provincial or regional level. This is the federal form of government. The Constitution clearly lays down the powers of different levels of government. This federal division of power involving higher and lower levels of government is also called the vertical division of power.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Power may also be shared among different social groups, such as religious and linguistic groups. Example: ‘Community government’ in Belgium is a good example of this arrangement. The government is elected by people belonging to one language community—Dutch, French and German speaking, no matter where they live.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) Power-sharing arrangement can also be seen in the way political parties, pressure groups and movements control or influence those in power. In contemporary democracies, this takes the form of competition among different parties who form alliances to contest elections. Example: In India, there were three major alliances in 2004 parliamentary elections the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) and the Left Front.
          </p>
<p>
           (v) In India, there is also a three-fold distribution of legislative powers divided between the centre and state in the form of Union List, State List and Concurrent List. Residuary subjects are legislated by centre.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 13.
           <br/>
           Why is one party system not good for democracy? [1 × 3 = 3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In uni-party system there is only one party in the political system. People are not allowed to criticise the government and form their own new parties. Voters do not have any choice at the time of elections. However, this system is against the principle of democracy which allows everybody to express his opinion. The uni-party system is like dictatorship where people have to follow all the policies of the government.
           <br/>
           People do not enjoy full rights and freedom. They are not allowed the freedom of thought and expression and the freedom to criticise the government policies. China has one party system.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 14.
           <br/>
           “Complaints are treated as testimony to the success of democracy.” Support the statement with examples. [1 × 3 = 3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Democracy provides scope for complaints through:
           <br/>
           (i) Freedom of speech and expression, carrying out of agitations and struggles through different methods by different sections of people. A democratic government is the only government that constantly improves itself. Complaints therefore help in improving a democracy. It is then that a democracy strengthens and deepens itself.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Complaints make a democratic government accountable and in the process ensure better decision-making.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) A democratic government is legitimate and this makes ordinary citizens value their democratic rights and take a position that democracy can address all social, economic and political problems. Critical evaluation of the policies of the government by the electronic media and newspapers also results in a healthier and vibrant democracy.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 15.
           <br/>
           “Average income is useful for comparison but it may hide disparities.” Support the statement with suitable arguments. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Total income is not a useful measure for comparison between countries. Since countries have different populations, comparing total income does not tell what an average person is likely to earn. Hence, we use average income which is total income of the country divided by total population.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) The defect of average as a measure is that it does not show the distribution. (dispersion) of income between the rich and the poor.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Per capita income doesn’t tell us anything about the distribution of income.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) Per capita income doesn’t measure various facilities and services that influence quality of life, For e.g. health facilities, education facilities, equal treatment, etc.
          </p>
<p>
           (v) Two countries may have the same average income but in one country almost every family may enjoy more or less the same kind of income, whereas in the other, some may be very rich and others very poor. The disparity between rich and poor is an important feature that the average measure (per capita income) does not consider.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 16.
           <br/>
           Explain any three reasons for the banks and cooperative societies to increase their lending facilities in rural areas. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Importance of formal sources of credit in the Economic Development:
           <br/>
           (i) Supervision. The formal sources work under the supervision of the RBI. The RBI monitors that the banks actually maintain cash balance and give loans to small cultivators and farmers too.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Lower rate of interest. The rate of interest of the formal sector is decided by the RBI. So normally, the interest rates are very low.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Cheap credit. Formal sources provide cheap credit. Credit at affordable rate is available through formal sources. Terms and conditions of credit through formal sources are regulated by government.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 17.
           <br/>
           Assess any three advantages of globalisation. [1 × 3 = 3]
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Assess any three advantages of multinational corporations. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           People with education, skill and wealth have benefitted by globalization:
           <br/>
           (i) Greater competition among producers (both local and foreign) has been advantageous to consumers, particularly the well-off section. Rich people enjoy improved quality and lower prices for several products and enjoy a higher standard of living.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) MNCs have increased their investments in India over the past 20 years in industries such as cellphones, automobiles, electronics, soft drinks, fast food and banking services.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) New jobs have been created in all these industries and services.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) Top Indian companies have benefitted from the increased competition. They have invested in newer technology and production methods.
          </p>
<p>
           (v) Some Indian companies have gained from successful collaborations with foreign companies. Globalization has enabled some companies to emerge as multinationals.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Globalisation is the process of rapid integration or inter-connection among countries. Over the last 20-30 years, these has been a tremendous increase in globalisation with the increase in the number of MNCs.
          </p>
<p>
           (i) MNCs set up production centres worldwide where cheap labour is available, markets are near and government policies are favourable.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) They supply produced goods to different countries.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Countries of the world have come closer due to increased movement of people between countries.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) MNCs provide money for additional investments for faster production.
          </p>
<p>
           (v) MNCs bring with them the latest technology and know-how for enhancing and improving the production process.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 18.
           <br/>
           India has to import crude oil. What problems do you anticipate for the country looking at the question of sustainability of development? [3 × 1 = 3]
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Distinguish between open unemployment and disguised unemployment. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           India does not produce enough or have adequate stock of crude oil of its own.
           <br/>
           It has to import it from oil producing countries. Looking at the increasing price of the crude oil, soon it may become a great financial burden on the country. In addition to this burden, due to fast industrialisation, the demand for crude oil is also likely to increase. The experts say that the global stock of crude oil may last only for 43 years more due to the increasing consumption. This makes sustainability of Indian growth difficult.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Structural or Open Unemployment: The working force in India is very large. It wants to work but the existing capital structure is unable to absorb them. The mismatch of available capital and the size of the labour force creates persistent Unemployment both in agriculture and industry. We lack resources to improve agriculture and industry to provide employment to our labour force. This causes Unemployment, called the Structural or Open Unemployment. Here, the worker is ready to work but he is unable to get any work.
          </p>
<p>
           Disguised Unemployment: Farmers in India use primitive resources of production in agriculture due to poverty and lack of ownership rights present in the existing tenure system. For example, if we use modern methods of cultivation, a situation can be created when only two persons of a family can complete the work in the farm instead of three. But lack of modem methods and poverty create a situation that three persons work when the same work can be performed by two persons. These factors cause disguised unemployment. It cannot be measured.
           <br/>
           It can be eradicated by carrying out massive land reforms.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Indentured labours were the bonded labourers under contract work for employers for specific amount of time.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Hundreds of thousands of Indian labourers went to work on plantations, in mines, roads and railway projects around the world. They were hired and promised return travel to India after five years of work.

           Question 20.
           <br/>
           Why did Mahatma Gandhi start the ‘Civil Disobedience Movement’? How did this movement unite the country? Explain. [2 + 3 = 5]
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Why did Mahatma Gandhi launch the ‘Non-Cooperation Movement’? How did this movement unite the country? Explain. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Non-fulfillment of demands made by Gandhiji on behalf of all the members of the Congress led ffo the launching of the Civil Disobedience Movement in 1930.
           <br/>
           Gandhiji’s ‘Dandi March’ marked the beginning of the Civil Disobedience Movement. Gandhiji started his march with 78 volunteers from his ashram at Sabarmati to the Gujarat coastal town of Dandi. On 6th April, Gandhiji reached Dandi and ceremonially violated the law, manufacturing salt by boiling sea water.
          </p>
<p>
           Features of Civil Disobedience Movement:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            People were now asked not only to refuse cooperation with the British but also to break colonial laws.
           </li>
<li>
            Foreign cloth was boycotted and people were asked to picket liquor shops.
           </li>
<li>
            Peasants were asked not to pay revenue and chaukidari taxes.
           </li>
<li>
            Students, lawyers and village officials were asked not to attend English medium schools, colleges, courts and offices.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Civil Disobedience Movement’ united the country –
           <br/>
           (i) Gandhiji led the salt march from Sabarmati Ashram to Dandi with his followers starting the Civil Disobedience Movement.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Thousands in different parts of the country broke the salt law, manufactured salt and demonstrated in front of government salt factories.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) In the countryside, the rich Patidars of Gujarat and Jats of Uttar Pradesh were active in the movement. As rich communities were very hard hit by the trade depression and falling prices, they became enthusiastic supporters of the Civil Disobedience Movement.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) As the depression continued and cash invoice dwindled, the small tenants found it difficult to pay the rent. They wanted the unpaid rent to the landlords to be remitted and thus they joined the movement.
          </p>
<p>
           (v) Merchants and industrialists supported the movement by giving financial assistance and also by refusing to buy and sell the imported goods.

           Mahatma Gandhi felt that British rule was established in India with the cooperation of the Indian people. If the Indians would refuse to cooperate, British rule would collapse.
          </p>
<p>
           (i) According to Gandhiji, non-cooperation could become a movement by unfolding in stages. It would begin with the surrender of titles that the government awarded, and a boycott of civil services, army, police, courts and legislative councils, schools and foreign goods. Then if the Government used repression, a full civil disobedience campaign would be launched.

           (i) In Awadh, the peasants’ movement led by Baba Ramchandra was against talukdars and landlords who demanded extremely high rents and a variety of other cesses, from the peasants. Peasants were forced to work in landlords’ farms without any payment (begar). Peasants had no security of tenure, they were regularly evicted so that they could acquire no right over the leased land. The demands of the peasants were: reduction of revenue, abolition of begar and social boycott of oppressive landlords.

<p>
           (ii) In the Gudem Hills of Andhra Pradesh, a militant guerrilla movement spread in the early 1920s against the closure of forest areas by the colonial government, preventing people from entering the forests to graze their cattle, or to collect fuelwood and fruits’. They felt that their traditional rights were being denied.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) For plantation workers in Assam, freedom meant the right to move freely in and out of the confined space in which they were enclosed. Under the Inland Emigration Act of 1859, plantation workers were not permitted to leave tea gardens without permission which was hardly granted. When they heard of the Non-Cooperation Movement, thousands of workers defied the authorities and left for their homes.

           Question 22.
           <br/>
           Explain the importance of means of transport as a prerequisite for the development of a country. [ 5 × 1 = 5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Transport plays an important role in the economy. Because of transport raw materials reach the factory and finished products reach to the consumer. The pace of development of a country depends upon the production of goods and services as well as their movement over space. Today the world has converted into a large village with the help of efficient and fast moving transport:
           <br/>
           (i) Good transport helps in quick carrying of raw materials from remote areas to the production centre and allows distribution of goods efficiently.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Transport helps in the development of communication. Various means of communication help us in interacting with other people in all the parts of the world. It has brought the world closer.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Transport like railways helps us in conducting various activities like business, sight seeing, pilgrimages, etc.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) Pipelines are used for transporting crude oil and natural gas to refineries and factories.
          </p>
<p>
           (v) Water provides the cheapest means of transport and is useful for international trade.
          </p>
<p>
           (vi) Air transport provides the fastest, most comfortable mode of transport.
          </p>
<p>
           (vii) Thus, it is dear that there are many advantages of transportation and communication. These means help in the development of the country. So they are rightly called the lifelines of a nation and its economy.

           Question 23.
           <br/>
           What was the Feminist Movement? Explain the political demands of the Feminist Movement in India. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Feminist Movements are radical women’s movements aiming at attaining equality for women in personal and family life and public affairs. These movements were organised and’,Agitated to raise channels for enhancing the political and legal status of women and improving their educational and career opportunities.
          </p>
<p>
           Political demands of the Feminist Movement in India:
           <br/>
           The one way to ensure that women related problems get adequate attention in India is to have more women as elected representatives. To achieve this, it is legally binding to have a fair proportion of women in the elected bodies. Panchayati Raj in India has reserved one- third seats in Local Government bodies for women.
          </p>
<p>
           In India the proportion of women in legislature has been very low. The percentage of elected women members in Lok Sabha is not even 10 per cent and in State Assemblies less than 5 per cent. India is behind several developing countries of Africa and Latin America. Women organizations have been demanding reservations of at least one-third seats in Lok Sabha and State Assemblies for women.
           <br/>
           And it was only, in March 2010, that the Women’s Reservation Bill was passed in the Rajya Sabha ensuring 33 per cent reservation to women in Parliament and State Legislative bodies.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 24.
           <br/>
           Explain the role of Political Parties in a democracy. [5]
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Explain the necessity of Political Parties in a democracy. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           To fill political offices and exercise political power, political parties perform a series of functions, which are the following:
           <br/>
           (i) Parties contest elections. Elections are fought mainly among candidates put up by political parties. In some countries like the USA, members and supporters of a party choose its candidates. In India, top party leaders choose candidates for contesting elections.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Parties put forward different policies and programmes. Political parties in a democracy, group together similar opinions to provide a direction in which government policies can be formulated.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Parties make laws for a country. Laws are debated and passed in the legislature. Since most of the members belong to a party, they go by the party leadership than personal opinions.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) Parties that lose elections play the role of the opposition. Opposition parties voice their views by criticising government for its failure or wrong policies.
          </p>
<p>
           (v) Parties shape public opinion. They raise and highlight issues and resolve people’s problems. Many pressure groups are the extensions of political parties.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           We can understand the necessity of political parties by imagining a situation without parties. Every candidate in the election will be independent. Therefore, no major policy changes will be made. Elected representatives will be accountable to their constituency but no one will be responsible for the smooth running of the country.
          </p>
<p>
           As societies become large and complex, they need an agency to gather views on various issues and to present them to the government. There is need to bring various representatives together so that a responsible government can be formed.
           <br/>
           A mechanism is needed to support or restrain the government to make policies, justify or oppose them. Political parties fulfil the needs of a representative government and are thus – a necessary condition for a democracy. Modem democracies cannot exist without political parties.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 25.
           <br/>
           Highlight the contribution of public sector in the economic development for a country. [5 × 1 = 5]

           </li>
<li>
            The public sector provides various services and facilities like construction of roads, bridges, railways, irrigation through dams, etc. where heavy spending is required,
           </li>
<li>
            A large number of activities are a primary responsibility of the government like schools, hospitals, housing, safe drinking water, etc.
           </li>
<li>
            Certain activities are meant to be supported by the government, like providing electricity to small scale industries at low prices, supply of food to the poor, etc. It encourages development of small, medium and cottage industries.
           </li>
<li>
            It ensures availability of goods and services at moderate rates and also contributes to community development through creation and expansion of infrastructure.

          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Tertiary sector has become the largest producer in India because various kinds of services such as hospitals, educational institutions, post and telegraph services, police stations, courts, village administrative offices, transport, banks, insurance companies etc. are required.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Even development of agriculture and industry leads to the development of services such as transport, trade and storage etc.

           <br/>
           Various forms of caste in politics:
           <br/>
           (i) When governments are formed, political parties usually take care that representatives of different castes and tribes find a place in it.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) When parties choose candidates, they keep in mind the composition of the electorate and accordingly choose candidates from different castes so as to muster necessary support to win elections.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Political parties make appeals to caste sentiments to gain support. Some political parties are known to favour some castes.
          </p>
<p>

           <br/>
           Highlight any five ways to increase employment in India. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) The government/banks can provide loans at cheap rates to the small farmers to improve their irrigational facilities like constructing a well so that they can irrigate their land well and get two to three crops a year instead of one. Thus more people can be employed in the same field.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Promote and locate industries and services in semi-rural areas where a large number of people may be employed. For example, setting up a dal mill, opening a cold storage, starting or promoting honey collection, etc.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Promoting small-scale industries, small-scale manufacturing units, agro-processing industries and providing loans for the same.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) If more dams are built and canal water is provided to all the small farmers, then a lot of employment can be generated in the agricultural sector.
          </p>
<p>
           (v) If more money is spent on transportation and storage, then not only small farmers will be benefitted but many more people can be employed in transport and storage sector.
          </p>
<p>
           (vi) Investing more in tourism and opening of new IT services employing more youth in these sectors.
