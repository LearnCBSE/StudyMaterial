<li>
            Jody’s father had been bitten by a rattlesnake.
           </li>
<li>
            Jody’s father killed the doe or she dear. He used her heart and liver to draw out the snake’s poison. In this way the doe saved Penny’s life.
           </li>
<li>
            Jody’s father had killed the doe. Without the mother-deer, the fawn was likely to starve to death in the forest. So Jody wanted to bring the young fawn home.
           </li>
<li>
            The spots on the fawn’s body made Jody know that it was a male.

</p>
<ol>
<li>
            Jody picked up the fawn into his arms and proceeded to home. After some dis­tance, he kept the fawn down and took rest. Later on, the fawn followed him. Thus he brought the fawn back home.

<li>
            Jody dipped his fingers in the milk. Then he left the fawn suck his fingers. He did so several times. Finally, the fawn drank off all the milk from the gourd.

<li>
            The fawn didn’t know how to raise its feet to climb the steps.

</span>
<br/>
           Jody looked after the faWh like a mother. He made it drink milk with his fingers dipped in milk. This is how a mother feeds her baby. Jody was glad that he had found the fawn.

<br/>
           Jody’s mother turned her nose when she heard that he was going to bring back the fawn. She gasped with surprise because she didn’t want to see an animal in her home.

             Question 2:
            </span>
<br/>
            Look at these two sentences.
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           He
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            tumbled
           </span>
           backward.
          </p>
<p>
           It
           <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            turned
           </span>
           its head.
          </p>
<p>
           The first sentence has an intransitive verb, a verb without an object. The second sentence has a transitive verb. It has a direct object. We can ask: “What did it turn?” You can answer. “Its head. It turned its head.”
           <br/>
           Say whether the verb in each sentence below is transitive or intransitive. Ask yourself a “what’ question about the verb, as in the example above. (For some verbs, the object is a person, so ask the question ‘who’ instead of ‘what’).

</span>
<br/>
           Most of the animals are our friends. Dogs, horses, elephants, cows are a few such animals that serve us. But man has been killing codfish or the whales for oil. Tigers are killed for their skin and bones. This is not fair. But there is no harm if any of them are killed strictly to save human life, properly and agriculture.
           <br/>
           However, killing animals is a crime. It is wrong to kill wild life for their hide or for pleasure.

           The young ones of cats, dogs and some birds attract us as does a human child. When I was a child, I wanted to adopt a kitten or a puppy as pet. I found a good breed puppy at my doorstep one day. But it created a commotion in the house. My mother got irritated at the veiy presence of pets in the house. They bite and bark, enter the kitchen or sit on our beds and make things dirty. But I assured her that I would look after my puppy and train it. The loyal dog would act as security guard and a playmate. My parents finally relented and let me have the poor puppy as a pet.

           I have taken a kitten as my pet. It is female with silky fur and skin. She keeps me busy. My mother does not take interest in my pet. She curses the little one for doing mischief, for moving about in the house, for making the bed and floor dirty. The kitten enters the kitchen and drinks up milk. She is naughty and disobedient also. She is most unlike a dog which is loyal, obedient and strong. Still I like my pet because it is lively, playful and frisky.

</strong>
           Human life is dependent on nature (that’s why we call her Mother Nature). We take everything from nature to live our lives. Do we give back anything to nature?

<br/>
            (i)
           </strong>
           Man and nature are complementary to each other. Man for ages has been using forests, minerals and chemicals for his survival. Earth and nature are our lifelines. They help us directly or indirectly. Take for example the paper we print, our books and newspapers. They are products of trees. We get fruits, flowers and fodder from nature. We get water and air free from nature. It is unfortunate that we are over using the limited resources and are also polluting them.
          </p>
<p>
           Nature is our Mother. We must not use up anything to the extent that it is not restored naturally. By cutting down trees or killing whales we are, in a way, depriving our children of their share. Let us give back to nature for the benefits we get from it.

             Question 3:
            </span>
<br/>
</strong>
           In This is Jody’s Fawn, Jody’s father uses a “home remedy’ for a snake bite. What
           <br/>
           should a person now do if he or she is bitten by a snake? Are all snakes poisonous?

             Answer:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Snakes are the most dreaded of wild creatures. This is why we use sticks to kill them. There are many poisonous snakes. Green snakes or water snakes are not poisonous. Still we cannot be sure of it. So we don’t take a chance. We call in a snake charmer to draw the cobra out of the house. A snake-bite can kill the victim in a few minutes. But the victim can be saved if he gets the first aid in the form of blood-letting and anti-venom serum. The cure for snake bite is prepared front the snake’s poison.
          </p>
<p>
           In case I am bitten by a poisonous snake, the first thing I would do is to put a band tightly over the bitten part. Then I shall use a blade or knife to make a small cut on the bitten part, and press the poisonous blood out. Then I shall go to hospital for medical help. I shall not go to sleep until I feel better and safe.

           Jody, the small boy, tells his father that he had left the fawn alone and defenceless to die. So it is their moral duty to save the innocent and hungry young one of the doe.

             Question 5:
            </span>

</strong>
           Why did Jody see only vultures and kites feeding on the dead body of the doe?

             Answer:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           The sand showed large footprints of tigers or leopards but they did not eat up the dead doe. The reason was that the big cats killed an animal themselves to eat its flesh. Vultres and kites are birds of prey. They also feed on the dead bodies.

           The fawn shook with fear as Jody drew near. It lifted its nose and scented the

           Jody decided to give away his share of milk to the fawn. He poured the milk into a small pot. Then he dipped his fingers in the milk and put them into its mouth. The fawn sucked slowly until the milk vanished.

           The story highlights two things. It is not fair to kill an animal for its use as a cure. Secondly, one should have pity and love for the animals.

             Question 1:

<br/>
</strong>
           How did Jody persuade his father to go to the forest to bring back the fawn?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
             Answer:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Jody was a small, brave and sensitive boy. He was with his father when he (his father) was bitten by a rattlesnake. His father quickly killed a doe and used its heart and liver to draw out the snake’s poison. Jody was happy to see that his father got a new life but at the same time he was worried for the little fawn who was left alone without its mother. He wanted to bring back the fawn. He requested his father to allow him to go to the forest to find the fawn. He told him that he didn’t need to drink milk because he was now a big boy. He would give the milk to the fawn. He also said that it was ungrateful to leave the fawn to starve. His father was in a fix. He couldn’t say “no’ to his son. And finally allowed him (Jody) to go to the forest to find the fawn.

           How did Jody feed the little fawn?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
             Answer:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Jody poured milk into a small gourd. He dipped his fingers in the milk and thrust them into the fawn’s soft wet mouth. It sucked greedily. When he withdrew them, it bleated frantically and butted him. He dipped his fingers again and as the fawn sucked, he lowered them slowly into the milk. The fawn blew and sucked and snorted. It stamped its small hoofs impatiently. As long as he held his fingers below the level of the milk, the fawn was content.
