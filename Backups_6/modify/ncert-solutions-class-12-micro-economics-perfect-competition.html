            Question 3. What is the relation between market price and average revenue of a price taking firm (i.e. perfectly competitive firm)? [1 Mark]
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           The average revenue (AR) of a firm is defined as total revenue per unit of output sold. Let a firm’s output be Q and the market price be P, then TR equals P x Q. Hence,
           <br/>
           \(AR=\frac { TR }{ Q } =\frac { P\quad \times \quad Q }{ P } =P\)
           <br/>
           In other words, for a price-taking firm, average revenue equals the market price.

<strong>
            Question 1. Explain feature of homogeneous product. [AI2004, 11; CBSE 07, 09C] Or
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Explain the implication of : homogeneous product.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
            Products sold in the market are homogeneous, i.e., they are identical in all respects like quality, colour, size, weight, design, etc.
           </li>
<li>
            The products sold by different firms in the market are equal in the eyes of the buyers.
           </li>
<li>
            Since, a buyer cannot distinguish between the product of one firm and that of another, he becomes indifferent as to the firms from which he buys.
           </li>
<li>
            The implication of this feature is that since the buyers treat the products as identical they are not ready to pay a different price for the product of any one firm. They will pay the same price for the products of all the firms in the industry. On the other hand, any attempt by a firm to sell its product at a higher price will fail.
            <br/>
            To sum up, the “homogeneous products” feature ensures a uniform price for the products of all the firms in the industry.

<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Yes, this statement is true.
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            As we know, in Perfect competition, homogeneous goods are produced. So, industry cannot charge different price from different firms.
           </li>
<li>
            So, industry will give that price to the firm where industry is in equilibrium, i.e., where Demand = Supply. Any movement from that point would be unstable.

            In the given diagram, price and revenue is measured on vertical axis and units of commodity on horizontal axis.

            Question 3. Explain features of perfect knowledge about the market.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
            Perfect Knowledge means both buyers and sellers are fully informed about the market.
           </li>
<li>
            The firms have all the knowledge about the product market and the input markets. Buyers also have perfect knowledge about the product market.
           </li>
<li>
            Let us first take the product market. The implication of perfect knowledge about the product market is that any attempt by any firm to charge a price higher than the prevailing uniform price will fail. The buyers will not pay because they have perfect knowledge. A uniform price prevails in the market.
           </li>
<li>
            Regarding the knowledge about the input markets the implicit assumption is that each firm has an equal access to the technology and the inputs used in the technology.
           </li>
<li>
            No firm has any cost advantage. Cost structure of each firm is the same.
           </li>
<li>
            Since there is uniform price and uniform cost in case of all firms, and since profit equals revenue less cost, all the firms earn uniform profits.
           </li>
</ol>

<strong>
            Question 4. What is the relationship between TR, AR and MR under perfect competition?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
            In the perfect competition, a firm is a price taker.
           </li>
<li>
            It has to sell its product at the same price as given (determined) by the industry. Consequently, price = AR = MR.
           </li>
<li>
            Hence, a firm’s AR and MR curve will be a horizontal straight line parallel to X axis.
           </li>
<li>
            Since price remains the same, i.e., MR is constant, therefore, TR increases at the Constant rate as increase in the output sold.
           </li>
<li>
            As the result of, TR curve facing a competitive firm is positively sloped straight line. Again, because at zero output Total Revenue is zero therefore, TR curve passes through the origin O as shown in the given figure.

<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
            AR curve of a firm under perfect competition is parallel to X-axis because in perfect competition homogeneous product are produced, that is why price remains constant and as we know AR = TR/Q = PX Q/Q = Price. So, AR remains constant.
           </li>
<li>
            As, AR is on Y-axis, that is why AR curve remains constant and parallel to X-axis.

<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer: Large number of sellers—:
           </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
            The words large number’ simply states that the number of sellers is large enough to render a single seller’s share in total market supply of the product insignificant,
           </li>
<li>
            Insignificant share means that if only one individual firm reduces or raises its own supply, the prevailing market price remains unaffected.
           </li>
<li>
            The prevailing market price is the one which was set through the intersection of market demand and market supply forces, for which all the sellers and all the buyers together are responsible. (iv) One single seller has no option but to sell what it produces at this market determined price. This position of an individual firm in the total market is referred to as price taker. This is a unique feature of a perfectly competitive market.

            Answer: Large number of sellers—:
           </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
            The words ‘large number’ simply states that the number of sellers is large enough to render a single seller’s share in total market supply of the product insignificant.
           </li>
<li>
            Insignificant share means that if only one individual firm reduces or raises its own supply, the prevailing market price remains unaffected.
           </li>
<li>
            The prevailing market price is the one which was set through the intersection of market demand and market supply forces, for which all the sellers and all the buyers together are responsible. (iv) One single seller has no option but to sell what it produces at this market determined price. This position of an individual firm in the total market is referred to as price taker. This is a unique feature of a perfectly competitive market.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
            Large number of buyers—:
           </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
            The words ‘large number’ simply states that the number of buyers is large enough, that an individual buyer’s share in total market demand is insignificant, the buyers cannot influence the market price on his own by changing his demand.
           </li>
<li>
            This makes a single buyer also a price taker.
            <br/>
            To sum up, the feature “large number” indicates ineffectiveness of a single seller or a single buyer in influencing the prevailing market price on its own, rendering him simply a price taker.
           </li>
</ol>

<p>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
            Buyers and sellers are free to enter or leave the market at any time
            <br/>
            they like. New firms induced by large profits can enter the industry whereas losses make inefficient firms to leave the industry.
           </li>
<li>
            The freedom of entry and exit of firms has an important implication. This ensures that no firm can earn above normal profit in the long run. Each firm earns just the normal profit, i.e., minimum necessary to carry on business.
           </li>
<li>
            Suppose the existing firms are earning above normal profits, i.e. positive economic profits. Attracted by the positive profits, the new firms enter the industry. The industry’s output, i.e. market supply, goes up. The prices come down. New firms continue to enter and the prices continue to fall till economic profits are reduced to zero.
           </li>
<li>
            Now suppose the existing firms .are incurring losses. The firms start leaving. The industry’s output starts falling, prices going up, and all this continues till losses are wiped out. The remaining firms in the industry then once again earn just the normal profits.
           </li>
<li>
            Only zero economic profit in the long run is the basic outcome of a perfectly competitive market.

<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
            A competitive market is a market in which there are many buyers and many sellers of an identical product so that each has a negligible impact on the market price.
           </li>
<li>
            Another type of market is a monopoly in which there is only one seller.
           </li>
<li>
            There are also other markets that fall between perfect competition and monopoly i.e. monopolistic competition.

            Question 2. What is the relationship between a perfectly competitive firm’s marginal cost curve and its short-run supply curve? [ 1 Mark]
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           The marginal cost curve of a perfectly competitive firm is the firm’s short- run supply curve at the point where price is equal to or greater than average variable cost. To determine its quantity supplied the firm equates the price of its product with its marginal cost.

            Answer:
           </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
            The supply curve of the firm tells us the quantity of the product that a firm is willing and able to produce and sell at each possible price.
           </li>
<li>
            The firm will produce and supply an output at the point at which Price is equal to Marginal cost. The derivation of the supply curve is explained with the help of the given figure.

</li>
<li>
            The SMC of the firm is given. Let us initially assume that the market price is OP
            <sub>
             1
            </sub>
            . The firm will produce and supply an output of OX
            <sub>
             1
            </sub>
            because at e1, price = MC. (OX
            <sub>
             1
            </sub>
            is the equilibrium output supplied, as MC = MR and MC cuts MR from below).
           </li>
<li>
            Suppose the market price rises to OP
            <sub>
             2
            </sub>
            , then the firm will produce and sell OX
            <sub>
             2
            </sub>
            level, because at e
            <sub>
             2
            </sub>
            level price = MC = MR.
           </li>
<li>
            Similarly, as market price increases to OP
            <sub>
             3
            </sub>
            , quantity supplied increases to OX3. However, the firm will not supply any quantity if the price falls below OP.
           </li>
<li>
            At OP price, the firm will produce and sell OX output. For any price below OP the firm will not produce and sell anything. The supply will be zero units. Having the above information, the supply schedule can be determined as,

</li>
<li>
            If the market price falls below the minimum of the SAVC, the supply curve jumps to the small segment (OP) on the vertical axis at which there is zero supply. Therefore, two discontinuous [(OP) + (e’S)] pieces define the short run supply curve for the perfectly competitive firm.
