            So You Want to be a Cartoonist
           </strong>
</p>
<p align="justify">
           What writers struggle to express through numerous newspaper columns, the cartoon manages in a pointed one-liner. Little wonder then, that the first thing most of us like to see when we pickup a newspaper is the cartoon. Simple though it may seem, making a cartoon is an art that requires a combination of hard work, training and a good sense of humour. Cartoonists say that the cartoons that make us laugh the most are in fact the cartoons that are hardest to make. Even celebrated cartoonists like R.K.Laxman admit that making a cartoon is not a piece of cake. Laxman says he has to wait for over six hours, which includes spending a lot of time scanning newspapers and television channels before any idea strikes him.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p align="justify">
           So how does one become a cartoonist? Which of us has the talent to make it? How can we master the rib-tickling strokes and the witty one-liners? How can we make people smile or laugh? There are few colleges or schools for cartoonists. Most cartoonists come from art colleges, while some learn the craft on their own. Most established cartoonists are of the view that no institute can teach you to make a cartoon. “You can pick up the craft, you may learn to sketch and draw in institutes, but no one can teach anyone how to make a good cartoon,” says Uday Shanker, a cartoonist with Navbharat Times. While basics, like drawing and sketching can be learnt in an art college, and are important skills, these alone, do not make a good cartoonist. Because it’s a question of one’s creativity and sense of humour; two qualities one simply may not have. The advice established cartoonists give is that just because you can sketch, don’t take it for granted that you will become a cartoonist.

           Unseen Passage for Class 9 | Well Rescued
          </h3>
<p align="justify">
           Ulhas Mandlik, 35, a power-loom owner from Ichalkaranji, Maharashtra, and his mother were homeward-bound one evening when heavy rain forced them to take shelter beneath a bridge. Not far away, a small group of labourers huddled together under a part of the cement housing above a 16 metre deep well used to pump water for irrigation.
          </p>
<p align="justify">
           Suddenly, Mandlik and his mother heard the labourers scream. When the two got to the well, they were told that a five year old boy named Hariya had fallen in through a side opening in the structure. Ignoring his mother’s fears, Mandlik quickly knotted together lengths of flimsy rope belonging to the labourers and asked them to lower him into the dark well. “I hope the rope holds,” he thought. As he descended, Mandlik noticed the metal rungs on the wall of the well. He grabbed hold of one and started climbing down, when he saw the boy clinging to a pipe running up the well’s centre. Grabbing the child, Mandlik started to climb praying that the old rungs wouldn’t give away and plunge them both into the churning water below. Their luck held and within a few minutes, Mandlik clambered to ground level and handed over Hariya to his sobbing father.
          </p>
<p align="justify">
           The man fell at Mandlik’s feet and offered him some money as a reward. Refusing the cash, Mandlik took Hariya and his family to a nearby eatery and offered them steaming tea to warm them up. Several organisations have honoured Mandlik for his bravery and presence of mind on that wet day three years ago. “I am happy I was at the right place at the right time,” he says,” and was able to return a little boy to his family.”

           Unseen Passage for Class 9 | Atithi Devo Bhavah
          </h3>
<p align="justify">
           New Delhi: Atithi Devo Bhavah. To make visitors to the city feel welcome during the Commonwealth Games, India Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) is set to train taxi and auto drivers, CISF personnel posted at monuments, dhaba owners, hotel staff etc. Participants will be taught English as well as courtesy and ways to communicate with tourists. At present, there is a shortage of trained guides in the city and with Commonwealth Games drawing close, the issue has to be addressed promptly.
          </p>
<p align="justify">
           With hundreds of historical sites to visit and each monument boasting its own unique history, foreign nationals are often left to fend for themselves and depend on tourist books and brochures for information. Language is another problem. Quite a contrast to facilities offered in tourist sites in western countries, where trained guides-proficient in several languages-are easily available to aid visitors apart from group-guided trips at regular intervals. Although the Archeological Survey of India (ASI) plans to introduce audio guide services in five languages at some world heritage sites our experts point that not a single monument or tourist place in the city has an interpretation centre where tourists can come and get all information pertaining to a particular site. ASI is also in the process of bringing out more brochures and guides for foreign visitors in the city. Experts say such facilities are crucial if the government wants to promote Delhi as a ‘heritage city’. Various agencies like INTACH are also involved in the plans.
          </p>
<p align="justify">
           Under ITDC’s plans, etiquette training for the Games will also be provided to residents who offer rooms to foreigners under Delhi government’s bed and breakfast scheme. “House-owners will be given hospitality related training and a brief of Indian tourism scenario. Most visitors generally question their hosts on information about the city so they will be provided information on the golden triangle- Delhi, Agra and Jaipur as well as where tourists should go visiting in Delhi,” said an official.

           Q1: What are the initiatives to be taken up by the India Tourism Development Corporation to make the visitors feel welcome during the Commonwealth Games?
           <b>
<br/>
</b>
           (i) training of drivers, CISF personals, dhaba owners and hotel staff.

           <br/>

           (iv) constructing more bed and breakfast homes.

<p align="justify">
           Q2: How have the western countries managed to offer aid and better facilities to their tourists?

<br/>

           Unseen Passage for Class 9 | Surgical Instruments Designed Due to Necessity
          </h3>
<p align="justify">
           Necessity, they say, is the mother of invention. And Indian doctors have been quite creative when hamstrung by few or no tools to perform specific surgeries. They simply design it themselves at one-fourth the price they are sold abroad. In fact, some of their innovations are priced at as much as hundreds of dollars abroad.
          </p>
<p align="justify">
           Take 47-year-old Dr Burjor P Banaji, pioneer of Lasik surgery in India. He’s invented over a dozen surgical instruments. When this senior eye surgeon at  Max Eye Care started Lasik, there were few surgeons doing it worldwide and no specific instruments were available either. “As I want things super-perfect, I designed a whole slew of instruments that made my surgery more efficient,” says Banaji. The most popular instruments are Banaji Lasik Shield and Banaji Lasik Spatula and Canulae. “It was simple. I had the designs in my head. Putting them down on paper was the simplest thing,” he says. Instruments manufacturers and large multinationals in the US snapped them up. “They would send me computer generated drawings which I would correct and send back. Their level of execution was astounding. Within two weeks of the designs being finalised, the instruments were in the world market.”
          </p>
<p align="justify">
           His instruments are priced at hundreds of dollars each in the US, and are also sold in Switzerland, South America, Korea, Eastern Europe, Africa and Japan. They’re available in India at a fraction of the price.

           Unseen Passage for Class 9 | Alfred Hitchcock
          </h3>
<p align="justify">
           Alfred Hitchcock was a man with vivid imagination, strong creative skills and a passion for life. With his unique style and God-gifted wit he produced and directed some of the most thrilling films that had the audience almost swooning with fright and falling off their seats with laughter. Alfred Hitchcock was greatly influenced by American films and magazines. At the age of 20, he took up a job at the office of Paramount Studio, London. Using imagination, talent and dedication, he made each of his endeavours a success. He took great pleasure in working in the studio and often worked all seven days a week. He moved to the USA in 1939 and got his American citizenship in 1955. Here, he produced many more films and hosted a weekly television show. No matter from where his ideas came, whether a magazine article, a mystery novel or incident, his films had the typical “Hitchcock touch”-where the agony of suspense was relieved by interludes of laughter! Hitchcock was knighted in 1980.

           Unseen Passage for Class 9 | Free Advice
          </h3>
<p align="justify">
           I was overwhelmed with gratuitous advice. Well-meaning yet ignorant friends thrust their opinions into unwilling ears. The majority of them said I couldn’t do without meat in the cold climate. I would catch consumption. Mr Z went to England and caught it on account of his foolhardiness. Others said I might do without flesh but without wine I could not move. I would be numbed with cold.
          </p>
<p align="justify">
           One went so far as to advise me to take eight bottles of whisky, for I should want them after leaving Aden. Another wanted me to smoke, for his friend was obliged to smoke in England. Even medical men, those who had been to England told the same tale. I replied that I would try my best to avoid all these things, but if they were found to be absolutely necessary I did not know what to do. I may here mention that my aversion to meat was not so strong then as it is now. I was even betrayed into taking meat about six or seven times at the period when I allowed my friends to think for me. But in the steamer, my ideas began to change. I thought I should not take meat on any account. My mother, before consenting to my departure, had exacted a promise from me not to take meat. So, I was bound not to take it, if only for the sake of the promise. The fellow passengers in the steamer began to advise us (the friend who was with me and myself) to try it. —
