           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In our country, election campaigns take place for a two-week period between the announcement of the final list of candidates and the date of polling. During this period, the candidates contact their voters, political leaders address election meetings and political parties mobilise their supporters.
          </p>
<p>
           This is also the period when newspapers and television news are full of election related stories and debates. But, election campaign is not limited to these two weeks only. Political parties start preparing for elections months before they actually take place.

           How does the polling take place?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The final stage of an election is the day when the voters cast or ‘poll’ their vote. That day is usually called the election day. Every person whose name is on the voters’ list can go to a nearby ‘polling booth’, situated usually in a local school or a government office. Once the voters go inside the booth, the election officials identify them, put a mark on their finger and allow then to cast their vote. An agent of each candidate is allowed to sit inside the polling booth and ensure that the voting takes place in a fair way.

           Question 1.
           <br/>
           What are the challenges to free and fair elections in India?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The elections in India are basically free and fair. But, a few candidates may win purely based on money power and unfair means. These challenges exist not just in India but also in many established democracies. These deeper issues are a matter of concern for those who believe in democracy. The challenges to free and fair elections in India are as follows.
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Candidates and parties with a lot of money may not be sure of their victory but they do enjoy a big and unfair advantage over smaller parties and independents.
           </li>
<li>
            In some parts of the country, candidates with criminal connection have been able to push others out of the electoral race and to secure a ‘ticket’ from major parties.
           </li>
<li>
            Some families tend to dominate political parties; tickets are distributed to relatives from these families.
           </li>
<li>
            Very often elections offer little choice to ordinary citizens, for both the major parties are quite similar to each other both in policies and practice.

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           How can you say that the outcome of elections is a final test of free and fair elections? Explain
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           One final test of the free and fair of election has in the outcome itself. If elections are not free or fair, the outcome always favours the powerful. In such a situation, the ruling parties do not lose elections. Usually, the losing party does not accept the outcome of a rigged election.
           <br/>
           The outcome of India’s elections speaks for itself:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            The ruling parties routinely lose elections in India both at the national and state level. In fact, in every two out of the three elections held in the last fifteen years, the ruling party lost.
           </li>
<li>
            In the US, an incumbent or ‘sitting’ elected representative rarely loses an election. In India, about half of the sitting MPs or MLAs lose elections.
           </li>
<li>
            Candidates who are known to have spent a lot of money on ‘buying votes’ and
            <br/>
            those with known criminal connections often lose elections.
           </li>
<li>

<p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           What do you mean by Voter’s List? What is its significance?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) In a democratic election, the list of those who are eligible to vote is prepared much before the election and given to everyone. This list is officially called the Electoral Roll and is commonly known as the Voters’ List.
           <br/>
           (ii) The significance of Voter’s List is as follows:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            This is an important step for it is linked to the first condition of a democratic election. Everyone should get an equal opportunity to choose representatives.
           </li>
<li>
            In our country, all the citizens aged 18 years and above can vote in an election. Every citizen has the right to vote, regardless of his or her caste, religion or gender.
           </li>
<li>
            It is the responsibility of the government to get the names of all the eligible voters put on the Voter’s List. As new persons attain voting age, names are added to the voters’ list. Names of those who move out of a place or those who are dead are deleted.
           </li>
<li>
            A complete revision of the list takes place every five years. This is done to ensure that it remains up to date. In the last few years a new system of Election Photo Identity Card (EPIC) has been introduced. The government has tried to give this card to every person on the voters’ list. But the card is not yet compulsory for voting. For voting, the voters can show many other proofs of identity like the ration card or the driving licence.

           The role of the Election Commission in conducting the free and fair elections is as follows.
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Election Commission takes decisions on every aspect of conduct and control of elections from the announcement of elections to the declaration of results.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>

           </li>
<li>
            In India, the poor, illiterate and underprivileged people vote in larger proportion as compared to the rich and privileged sections. This is in contrast to western democracies.
           </li>
<li>
            Common people in India attach a lot of importance to elections. They feel that through elections, they can bring pressure on political parties to adopt policies and programmes favourable to them.
           </li>
<li>
            The interest of voters in election-related activities has been increasing over the years. During the 2004 elections, more than one-third voters took part in a campaign-related activity.
           </li>
<li>
            More than half of the people identified themselves as being close to one or the other political party. One out of every seven voters is a member of a political party.

<li>
            Elections should be conducted in a free and fair manner.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Can elections be considered as competition ?
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Elections can be considered as a competition. It is a political competition. The competition is among political parties. At the constituency level, it is a competition among several candidates. If there is no competition, elections will become pointless.
          </p>
<p>
           An electoral competition also has many demerits . It creates a sense of disunity and ‘factionalism’ in every locality. Different political parties and leaders often level allegations against one another. Parties and candidates often use dirty tricks to win elections.
          </p>
<p>
           Some good people who may wish to serve the country do not enter this arena because of this unhealthy competition.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           What is our system of elections?
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Elections for the Lok sabha are held every 5 years. After five years the term of all the elected representatives comes to an end. The Lok Sabha stands ‘dissolved’.
          </p>
<p>
           Elections for the Lok Sabha are held in all constituencies on the same day or within a few days. This is called a general election. Sometimes election is held only for one constituency to fill the vacancy caused by death or resignation of a member. This is called a by election.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           What are electoral constituencies?
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           India is divided into different areas for purposes of elections. These areas are called electoral constituencies. We follow an area based system of representation. The voters who live in a particular constituencies elect one person to represent their constituencies.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           How many constituencies do we have in India?
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           India is divided into 543 constituencies for Lok Sabha elections. The representative elected from each constituency is called a Member of Parliament.
          </p>
<p>
           Similarly, each state is divided into a number of Assembly constituencies, depending on its population and it size.The elected representative of the Assembly constituencies are called the Member of Legislative Assembly or an MLA.
           <br/>
           Each Parliamentary constituency has several Assembly constituencies .
          </p>
<p>
           Question 6.
           <br/>
           What are Reserved Constituencies ?
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Reserved Constituencies are constituencies that are set aside for certain weaker sections of the society.
           <br/>
           Weaker sections of the society may not stand a good chance to get elected to the Lok Sabha and the State Legislative Assemblies. They may not have the required resources, education and contacts to contest and win elections against others. Those who are influential and resourceful may prevent them from winning elections.
          </p>
<p>
           As our Constitution entitles every citizen to elect its representative, Reserved Constituencies are a necessity.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 7.
           <br/>
           Who can vote and who cannot vote in India ?
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           In India , all the citizens above the age of 18 can vote in an election. They have the right to vote, regardless of their caste, religion or gender.
          </p>
<p>
           The government gets the names of all the eligible voters and prepares the voters’ list. As new persons attain voting age names are added to the voters’ list. Names of those who move out of a place or those who are dead are deleted. A complete revision of the list takes place every five years.
           <br/>
           Criminals and persons with unsound mind are denied the right to vote.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 8.
           <br/>
           What should a citizen do if he or she wants to contest the elections?
           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           Every person who wishes to contest an election has to fill a ‘nomination form’ and pay a ‘security deposit’. They are requested to present a declaration. The legal declaration has to have the following details:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Details of any serious criminal cases pending against them. (If applicable).
           </li>
<li>
            Details of the assets and liabilities they have and that of their family members.
           </li>
<li>
            Educational qualifications.
            <br/>
            This information will be made public. This provides an opportunity to the voters to voice their objections, if any, and make the right decision during elections.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Question 9.
           <br/>

<ul>
<li>
            The Ballot Paper: A ballot paper is a sheet of paper on which the names of the contesting candidates along with their party name and symbols are listed. The voters indicate whom they want to vote for by putting a stamp on the ballot paper.
           </li>
<li>
            Electronic Voting: Electronic voting machines (EVM) are used to record votes. The machine shows the names of the candidates and the party symbols. The voter has to press the button corresponding to the name of the person he wants to vote. Then the vote gets registered automatically.
            <br/>
            Independent candidates too have their own symbols, allotted by election officials. Voting is conducted in total secrecy.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Question 10.
           <br/>

           <br/>

           </li>
</ul>

           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           In the Lok Sabha, 79 seats are reserved for the Scheduled Castes and 41 for the Scheduled Tribes. This number is proportionate to their population. This reservation does not lessen the legitimate share of any other social group.

<li>
            It implements the Code of Conduct and punishes any candidate or party that violates it
           </li>
<li>
            During the election period, the EC can order the government to follow some guidelines, to prevent use and misuse of governmental power to enhance its chances to win elections, or to transfer some government officials
           </li>
<li>
            When on election duty, government officers work under the control of the EC and not the government.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
