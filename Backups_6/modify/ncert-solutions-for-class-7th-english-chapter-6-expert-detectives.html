</span>
<br/>

</ul>
<p>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
            Mr Nath used to eat two chapattis, some dal and a vegetable.
           </li>
<li>
            He used to eats in the morning and evening.

<strong>
             Question 2:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Why does Maya think Mr Nath is a crook? Who does she say the Sunday visitor is?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Maya thinks that Mr Nath is a crook because he doesn’t talk to anyone and has no friends. She believes that his scars are result of shoot-out with police.
           <br/>
           He doesn’t work anywhere and sits at home all the day and there are no visitors at his place except the Sunday morning guest.
           <br/>
           He is not bothered about his meals and pays the money in cash. She thinks that the Sunday visitor is his partner in the crime. He keeps the money from the loot and comes to give Mr Nath his share.
          </p>
<p>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Question 3:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Does Nishad agree with Maya about Mr Nath? How does he feel about him?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           No, Nishad doesn’t agree with Maya about Mr Nath. He feels bad for Mr Nath because he thinks that he is a poor and lonely man.
           <br/>
           He also feels that he is a generous man because he gives tips to Ramesh regularly. He is determined to find why he is so thin and lonely.

<strong>
             Question 1:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Who do you think Mr Nath is? Write a paragraph or two about him.
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Mr Nath is a lean and thin person. He might have met with some serious accident with fire which has resulted in many scars on his face. People are scared about him for those scars which give his face an ugly impression.
           <br/>
           He realises the same and that is why he prefers living along and avoids going out. He talks less, but is a well-mannered person and is polite towards everyone.
           <br/>
           He is regularly consulting Maya and Nishad’s mother, who is a doctor. May be he is not keeping well and that could be the reason behind his gaunt appearance.
           <br/>
           He has a brother who visits him every Sunday to find out about his health. Mr Nishad is not much interested about nitty-gritty’s of life and prefer eating same simple food daily.
          </p>
<p>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Question 2:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           What else do you think Nishad and Maya will find out about him? How? Will they ever be friends? Think about these questions and write a paragraph or two to continue the story.
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Nishad and Maya would have found out that the Sunday visitor is Mr Nath’s brother.
           <br/>
           Mr Nath used to work for a big private company and has left the job for while because he was not keeping well.
           <br/>
           He is suffering from some liver ailment and will be undergoing a surgery soon.
           <br/>
           Nishad succeeds in befriending him and goes to his house every evening to play with him. He finds Mr Nath a caring and loving person.
           <br/>
           He becomes a frequent visitor to his place. Maya regrets about her earlier thoughts about Mr Nath.
           <br/>
           She feels sorry about it. Nishad takes her along one day and the they all become friends.

<strong>

</span>
<br/>
           Describe Nishad as a child.
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Nishad as a child was kind and considerate. He kept in mind all the good things his mother and Ramesh told him about Mr Nath and formed his opinion based on them. He was upset with Mr Nath being so lean and thin. He thought that the man might be starving so he went to his place and gave him a bar of chocolate.
           <br/>
           He refused calling him a crook even after being insisted several times by his sister and decided to befriend him because he liked him.

<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Maya collected the following facts
           <br/>
           His name was Mr Nath and they must find out his first name. Other tenants at Shankar House called him mad, strange and unfriendly.
           <br/>
           He didn’t speak with anyone and lacked manners. He never received any letters and has been living as tenant in Room No 10 in Shankar House. He didn’t use to work anywhere and was at his room the whole day. All the kids and some of the grown up people in Shankar House were scared of him.
           <br/>
           He had no visitors except the same man on every Sunday. Ramesh used to get his food from the restaurant downstairs and Mr Nath was not much bothered about it. He used to pay him immediately and also used to give tips.

<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Question 1:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Nishad decides to trust Mr Nath. Do you think we should trust others, why so?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           We should trust others. We should not doubt people around us unless there is a strong reason for it. People might be behaving in a way which might appear strange to us, but they might be trying to hide their pains and grief though that.
           <br/>
           We should not make judgement about people without properly knowing about them. Trust is the first step towards making any relation. We should have trust on our friends and family members.
          </p>
<p>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Question 2:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           We should be friendly towards our neighbours. Why so?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Our neighbours live near our homes. We meet them daily. They come to our help during bad times and in good times. We share our joys with them. We become friends with our neighbours who are of our age. We play with them and share our things with them. We should be friendly with them and cooperative towards them.
           <br/>
           It is the responsibility of every human being to be good towards society. We should be good towards our neighbours and must help them in time of their needs.

           him. “He’s probably got millions of rupees stashed

           <br/>
           When they returned, Nishad told me he’d been to see
           <br/>
           Mr Nath and I felt most annoyed that I hadn’t been
           <br/>
           there. Seven had been quite upset about Mr Nath’s
           <br/>
           gaunt appearance and was sure that he was starving.
           <br/>
           He told me that he knocked loudly on Mr Nath’s
           <br/>
           door that evening and said, “Open the door quickly,
           <br/>
           Mr Nath.”
