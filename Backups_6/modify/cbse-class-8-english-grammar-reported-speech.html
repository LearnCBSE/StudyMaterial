            NCERT Solutions for Class 8 English

           . Here we have given CBSE Class 8 English Grammar Reported Speech.
          </p>
<h2>
           CBSE Class 8 English Grammar Reported Speech
          </h2>
<p>
           1. There are two different ways in which we can report the words of a speaker :
           <br/>
           (a) Direct Speech or Direct Narration.
           <br/>
           (b) Indirect Speech or Indirect Narration.
          </p>
<p>
           2. (a) Direct Speech contains the actual words of the speaker ; as—
           <br/>
           Sarla said, “My father has a roaring business in Mumbai.”
           <br/>
           He said to me, “I am feeling unwell today.”
           <br/>
           In these sentences, actual words of the speaker are given within inverted commas without any change.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           (b) Indirect Speech gives the substance of the speaker’s actual words and not the exact words spoken by him or her ; as—
           <br/>
           Sarla said that her father had a roaring business in Mumbai.
           <br/>
           He told me that he was feeling unwell that day.
          </p>
<p>
           3. The actual words of the speaker, given within ‘inverted commas’ are called the Reported Speech. In the same way, the Verb which introduces the Reported Speech is called the Reporting Verb.
           <br/>
           In the sentence above ‘said’ is the Reporting Verb and ‘My father has a roaring business in Mumbai’ is the Reported Speech.
           <br/>
           Reporting Verb and Reported Speech. Look at the following sentences :
           <br/>
           Radha says, “I shall finish my home-work today.”
           <br/>
           Sushma said to Pushpa, “Show me your dolls.”
           <br/>
           The verbs ‘says and said’ in the above sentences are ‘Reporting Verbs’.
           <br/>
           The exact words of the speaker given within the inverted commas are ‘Reported Speech’.
          </p>
<p>
           4. Here are some distinctive points regarding the Direct Speech and Indirect Speech : In the Direct Speech
           <br/>
           1. The Reported Speech is put within Reported (Inverted) Commas.
           <br/>
           2. The Reported Speech and the Reporting Verb are separated by a Comma.
           <br/>
           3. The first word of the Reported Speech begins with a capital letter.
          </p>
