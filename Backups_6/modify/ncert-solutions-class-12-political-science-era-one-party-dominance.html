             Answer:

</span>
           The Congress Party became a social and ideological coalition for it merged different social groups alongwith their identity holding different beliefs:
           <br/>
           1. It accommodated the revolutionary, conservative, pacifist, radical, extremist and moderates and the rights and the left with all other shades of the centre.
           <br/>
           2. Congress became a platform for numerous groups, interests and even political parties to take part in the national movement.

           <br/>
           (a) In pre-independence days, many organisations and parties with their own constitutions and organisational structures were allowed to exist within the Congress.

<span style="color: #339966;">
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
             Answer:
            </strong>
</span>
           No, the prevalence of one party dominance system did not affect adversely the democratic nature of Indian politics because:
           <br/>
           1. The key role of Congress in the freedom struggle gave it a head start over others.
           <br/>
           2. The Congress accommodated diversified interests, religion, beliefs and aspirations to strengthen democracy.
           <br/>
           3. Despite being taken place of free and fair elections, Congress won elections in the same manner again and again.
           <br/>
           4. Congress party consisted of various factions inside itself, based on ideological considerations who never taught together or went out of Congress.
           <br/>
           5. Hence, on the basis of above mentioned criterion, it can be concluded that Congress strengthened ideals of democracy and held unity and integrity of the country.

            </strong>
</span>
           There was a difference between one party domination in India and Mexico. In Mexico, this was a one party system only not dominance because:
           <br/>
           1. In India, the Congress party dominated on behalf of popular consensus but Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) (in Spanish) ruled on behalf of perfect dictatorship.
           <br/>
           2. In India, free and fair elections took place, where the losing of election was also fair but it Mexico, elections were based on malpractices, dominated by PRI.

             Answer:
            </strong>
</span>
           The first general election was the first big test of democracy in a poor and illiterate country. Till then democracy had existed only in the prosperous countries. By that time many countries in Europe had not given voting rights to all women. In this context India’s experiment with universal adult franchise appeared very bold and risky. India’s general election of 1952 became a landmark in the history of democracy all over the world. It was no longer possible to argue that domocratic elections could not be held on conditions of poverty or lack of education. It proved that democracy could be practised anywhere in the world. The next two general elections strengthened democratic set-up in India.

</span>
           India is not the only country to have dominance of one party but we have some other examples also for the same. But the dominance of one party in India does not compromise democratic spirit of constitution whereas other nations have compromised it:
           <br/>
           1. In countries like China, Cuba and Syria are permitted to be ruled by one party only by the constitutional provisions.
           <br/>
           2. Myanmar, Belarus, Egypt also experience one party system due to legal and military measurer.
           <br/>
           3. In India, Congress dominates on behalf of free and fair elections based on democracy where the losing of other party is also fair.

           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            This coalition-like character of the Congress gave it an unusual strength. Firstly, a coalition accommodates all those who join it. Therefore, it has to avoid any extreme position and strike a balance on almost all issues. Compromise and inclusiveness are the hallmarks of a coalition. This strategy put the opposition in a difficulty. Anything that the opposition wanted to say, would also find a place in the programme and ideology of the Congress. Secondly, in a party that has the nature of a coalition, there is a greater tolerance of internal differences and ambitions of various groups and leaders are accommodated. The Congress did both these things during the freedom struggle and
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            continued doing this even after Independence. That is why, even if a group was not happy with the position of the party or with its share of power, it would remain inside the party and fight the other groups rather than leaving the party and becoming an ‘opposition’.

<strong>
            The socialists believed in the ideology of democratic socialism which distinguished them both from the Congress as well as from the Communists. They criticised the Congress for favouring capitalists and landlords and for ignoring the workers and the peasants. But the socialists faced a dilemma when in 1955 the Congress declared its goal to be the socialist pattern of society. Thus it became difficult for the socialists to present themselves as an effective alternative to the Congress. Some of them, led by Rammanohar Lohia, increased their distance from and criticism of the Congress party. Some others like Asoka Mehta advocated a limited cooperation with the Congress.

           There was a difference between one party domination in India and Mexico. In Mexico, this was a one party system only not dominance because:
           <br/>
           1. In India, the Congress Party dominated on behalf of popular consensus but Institutional Revolu-tionary Party (PRI) (in Spanish) ruled on behalf of perfect dictatorship.
           <br/>
           2. In India, free and fair elections took place, where the losing of election was also fair but in Mexico, elections were based on malpractices, dominated by PRI.
           <br/>
           In our opinion one party dominance¬like India is better because this sort of dominance:
           <br/>

           first general elections in 1952 as non-Congress parties which succeeded to gain only a taken of representation in Lok Sabha and State Assemblies. These parties maintained a democratic character of the system:
           <br/>
           1. These offered a criticism based on principles to keep ruling party under check.
