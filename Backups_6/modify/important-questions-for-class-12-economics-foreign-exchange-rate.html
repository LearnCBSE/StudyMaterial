            8. How does giving incentives for exports influence foreign exchange rate? Explain
           </strong>
<strong>
            (Delhi 2014)
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           The incentives for exports boosts exports for the country. As a result of increase in exports the supply of foreign currency in the country increases. With demand remaining the same, this results in a fall in the exchange rate implying currency appreciation.

           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           When government increase the import duty of gold, the import of gold will fall. This reduces the demand for foreign currency. With the supply of foreign currency remaining same, the foreign exchange rate would fall.
           <br/>
           This implies appreciation of rupees.

           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           Domestic currency appreciates when there is a fall in foreign exchange rate, the domestic economy can now buy more quantity of goods and services from foreign countries with the same amount of domestic currency. As a result imports rise.
           <br/>
           e.g. When Rs. Â / $ exchange rate falls from 55 to 50, it leads to currency appreciation and this will help in buying more and more units of foreign goods as a result demand for foreign goods will rise. i.e. imports will rise.

<strong>
            14.Explain the effect of depreciation of domestic currency on exports. (All India 2013)
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           Domestic currency depreciates when there is a rise in foreign exchange rate. Depreciation has an expansionary effect on Aggregate Demand and output. Depreciation increases the demand for domestically produced goods by reducing their relative price. This will lead to increase in exports and hence fall in imports, as now foreign country can buy greater units in the domestic country with same amount of their currency.

<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           Foreign exchange rate is determined by the market forces of demand and supply in foreign exchange market. The point where demand and supply of foreign exchange meet, gives the equilibrium rate of exchange as shown in figure and quantity of foreign exchange.

<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>

           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           Increase in foreign direct investment will result in more supply of foreign exchange therefore, due to excess supply, price of foreign exchange will fall. i.e. exchange rate falls which leads to appreciation of domestic currency.

            There is an inverse relationship between foreign exchange rate and demand for foreign exchange. Explain why? (Delhi 2009c)
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           Exchange rate of foreign currency is inversely related to the demand. When price of a foreign currency rises, it results into costlier imports for the country. As imports become costlier, the demand for foreign products also reduce. This leads to reduction in demand for that foreign currency and vice-versa.

<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           Rise in exchange rate of foreign currency refers to appreciation of foreign currency in relation to domestic currency. When there is rise in foreign exchange rate (Say from Rs. 55 per$ to Rs. 60 per $), it leads to depreciation of domestic currency and rise in exports leading to rise in supply of foreign exchange supply.

<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           Foreign exchange rate shares an inverse relationship with the demand for that currency, with a fall in the price of foreign exchange, value of domestic currency increases (i.e. appreciation of domestic currency) and that means foreign goods become cheaper and their domestic demand (i.e. imports) increases. The rising domestic demand for foreign goods implies higher demand for foreign exchange which increased from OC1 to OQ

<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           The supply of foreign currency is directly proportional to the price of foreign exchange. When the price of a foreign currency falls, it leads to cheaper imports and costlier exports as it leads to appre ciation of domestic currency. The exporters are discouraged due to costlier exports. This results lesser inflow or supply of foreign currency in the economy. As a result supply of foreign exchange decreases from OQ

            22. Give the meaning of foreign exchange rate. How it is determined under flexible exchange rate system? (All India 2011)
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
<strong>
            Foreign exchange rate
           </strong>
           Foreign exchange rate refers to the rate at which one currency can be exchanged for the other currency in foreign exchange market, e.g. if Rs. 58 is paid to buy one US dollar, then Rs./$ exchange rate will be 58 i.e. Rs.58 per dollar.
           <br/>
           Flexible rate of exchange is also called free rate of exchange, as it is freely determined by the market forces of supply and demand of foreign exchange in the international market. If the demand for foreign exchange rises, its value will also rise and if demand for foreign exchange falls, its value will also fall.
           <br/>
<img alt="important-questions-for-class-12-economics-foreign-exchange-rate-TP1-3MQ-22" height="178" loading="lazy" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5673/22987985552_4ac382a64b_o.png" width="252"/>
<br/>
           Similarly, supply of foreign exchange also influences the exchange rate. Greater the supply, lower the rate of exchange. The point at which demand for foreign exchange and supply of foreign exchange meets, gives the equilibrium rate of exchange at OR. Any rate above equilibrium would lead to excess supply and any exchange rate below equilibrium would lead to excess demand.

<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           (i) when the price of a foreign currency rises, the imports become costlier and exports become cheaperÂ so the value of imports will fall with time, hence the demand for foreign exchange will fall.
           <br/>
           (ii) When domestic companies want to buy foreign assets and with the rise in price of foreign currency the price of the assets also increases. Hence, the demand for foreign exchange falls.

           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           When the value of domestic currency increases in relation to a foreign currency due to demand and supply forces in a free market, it is termed as appreciation of the domestic currency.
           <br/>
           Depreciation of the domestic currency occurs when the value of domestic countryâs currency decreases in relation to the foreign currency.
           <br/>
           For example, Increase in exchange rate is currency depreciation and decrease in exchange rate is currency appreciation.
           <br/>
           (i) When Rs./$ exchange rate falls from 55 to 50 , it is termed as appreciation of domestic currency (i.e. Indian rupee) â
           <br/>
           (ii) When Rs./$ exchange rate rises from 50 to 55, it is termed as depreciation of domestic currency .

            32. How is foreign exchange rate is determined in the market?(All India 2009)
           </strong>
<br/>
           Foreign exchange rate is determined by the market forces of demand and supply in foreign exchange market. The point where demand and supply of foreign exchange meet, gives the equilibrium rate of exchange
          </p>
<p>
<img alt="important-questions-for-class-12-economics-foreign-exchange-rate-TP1-4MQ-32" height="192" loading="lazy" src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/637/22378664744_7a7ec92f15_o.png" width="237"/>
           In the above figure, D stands for the demand for foreign exchange and 5 curve represents the supply of foreign exchange for different values of R i.e. rate of exchange. Point E is the equilibrium point, where D =5, so R will be the rate of exchange. If the rate of exchange is arbitrarily fixed other than R, there wi 11 be a situation of either excess demand or excess supply of foreign exchange, so R is the rate of exchange which is obtained from the equilibrium point E. Any disequilibrium will be adjusted automatically by the forces of demand and supply of foreign exchange to attain equilibrium.

            33. Give the meaning of foreign exchange and foreign exchange rate. Giving reason, explain the relation between foreign exchange rate and demand for foreign exchange. (All India 2012)
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
<strong>
            Foreign exchange
           </strong>
           Foreign exchange rate is determined by the market forces of demand and supply in foreign exchange market. The point where demand and supply of foreign exchange meet, gives the equilibrium rate of exchange as shown in figure and quantity of foreign exchange.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            Foreign exchange rate
           </strong>
           Foreign exchange rate refers to the rate at which one currency can be exchanged for the other currency in foreign exchange market, e.g. if Rs. 58 is paid to buy one US dollar, then Rs./$ exchange rate will be 58 i.e. Rs.58 per dollar.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            Relation between foreign exchange rate and demand for foreign exchange
           </strong>
           There is an inverse relationship between the foreign exchange rate and demand for foreign exchange, with the rise in foreign exchange rate, demand for foreign exchange falls and vice-versa.
           <br/>
<img alt="important-questions-for-class-12-economics-foreign-exchange-rate-TP1-6MQ-33" height="173" loading="lazy" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5706/22987985172_afcf802a92_o.png" width="232"/>
<br/>
           In the above figure, D curve represent the demand for foreign currency. When exchange rate is high (R1), demand for the foreign currency falls (Q1,). On the other hand, when exchange rate is low (R
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           ), demand for the foreign currency rises Q
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           . The demand curve for the foreign currency is always downward sloped and signifies an inverse relationship between demand and exchange rate i.e. price of foreign exchange.
