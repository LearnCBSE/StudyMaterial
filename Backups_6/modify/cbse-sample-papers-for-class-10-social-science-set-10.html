           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Africa attracted Europeans for several reasons. These reasons are enumerated as follows:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Europeans were attracted towards Africa due to its vast minerals and land resources.
           </li>
<li>
            Crop production and plantation opportunities in Africa also attracted them.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           The three aspects of life in which women are discriminated against in our country are
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Education The literacy rate among women is only 54 percent as compared with 76 percent among men. When it comes to higher education, a smaller proportion of girls, in comparison to the boys, are allowed to go for higher studies. This is because parents prefer to spend their resources on their son’s education.
           </li>
<li>
            Sex ratio In many parts of India, parents find ways to abort the girl child in a will to have a son. This has led to a decline in the child sex ratio (number of girl children per thousand boys) in the country to merely 1919.
           </li>

           <br/>
           The Reserve Bank of India supervises the Banking system due to the following reasons:

<ul>
<li>
            The RBI monitors that the banks maintain a minimum cash balance.
           </li>
<li>
            The RBI ensures that the banks give loans not just to profit-making businessmen and traders but also to small cultivators, small-scale industries, and small borrowers.
           </li>
<li>
            Banks have to submit information to the RBI on how much they are lending, to whom, at what interest rates, etc.

           (i) Identify the country that most probably has a well-developed healthcare system but a lesser average education than India.
           <br/>
           (ii) What do the terms life expectancy and mean years of schooling indicate concerning human development?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Nepal has a well-developed healthcare system but a lesser average education than India. The life expectancy of Nepal is 70.6 and the mean year of schooling of people aged 25 and above is 4.9. So, the life expectancy in Nepal is higher than in India which indicates a well-developed healthcare system in the country while the mean year of schooling in Nepal is lower than in India.
           <br/>
           (ii) Life expectancy at birth indicates the healthcare status of the country. Good healthcare facilities in the country show a higher life expectancy.
          </p>
<p>
           The mean year of schooling indicates the literacy level of the country. The higher the education facilities provided to the public, the higher the mean year schooling which results in higher education status of the country.

           Question 30.
           <br/>
           The first clear expression of nationalism came with the French Revolution in 1789. Elucidate.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           What was the status of people in Europe during economic hardships in the 1830s?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           France was a full-fledged territorial state in 1789 under the rule of an absolute monarchy. The estate general, renamed as General Assembly, became an elected body.
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            The revolution proclaimed that it was the people who would henceforth constitute the nation and shape its destiny. A new French flag, the Tricolour, was chosen to replace the former royal standard.
           </li>
<li>
            A centralised administrative system was put in place, and it formulated uniform laws for all citizens within its territory. Internal customs duties and dues were abolished and a uniform system of weights and measures was adopted.
           </li>
<li>
            Regional dialects were discouraged and French, as it was spoken and written in Paris, became the common language of the nation.
           </li>
<li>
            The revolutionaries further declared that it was the mission and the destiny of the French nation to help other people of Europe to become independent nations.
           </li>
<li>
            With the outbreak of revolutionary wars, the French armies began to carry the idea of nationalism abroad. Thus, France became a nation-state, and the world got a clear expression of nationalism through the French Revolution.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           OR
           <br/>
           In the 1830s, the employment rate in the economy was lower. People migrated from rural areas to urban areas in search of jobs. Small producers faced stiff competition due to imported cheap machines which were produced in England. where industries were much more advanced. Textile industry faced a major setback as the production used to be carried out in small workshops or homes. The regions of Europe where the aristocracy was still prevalent had peasants who struggled from burden of feudal dues and obligations. The economy suffered from widespread poverty on account of price inflation and bad harvest season.

           Question 31.
           <br/>
           “Dynastic succession is one of the most serious challenges before the political parties.” Examine the statement. (5)
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Discuss the influence of political parties on the government. (5)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Dynastic succession is defined as a desire of few to concentrate political powers in their own hands.
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            It is one of the most serious challenges before the political parties because most political parties do not practice open and transparent procedures for their functioning.
           </li>
<li>
            there are few ways for an ordinary worker to rise to the top in a party.
           </li>
<li>
            in many parties, the top positions are always controlled by members of one family. This practice is unfair to other members of that party and is also bad for a democracy.
           </li>
<li>
            people who do not have adequate experience or popular support come to occupy positions of power.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           or
           <br/>
           Political parties are called the government in disguise due to the following reasons
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            In most democracies, elections are fought mainly among the candidates put up by political parties.
           </li>
<li>
            Parties put forward different policies and programmes and the voters choose from them.
           </li>

            Parties play a decisive role in making laws for a country They shape public opinions to raise and highlight issues.
           </li>
<li>
            Parties torn and run governments.
           </li>
<li>

           Question 32.
           <br/>
           Why was the cotton textile industry concentrated in the cotton growing belt in the early years? Explain.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Classify the pollution created by industries.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Cotton textile industry was concentrated in the cotton growing belt in the early years because:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Availability of raw cotton: Good quality raw cotton was easily available in the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat.
           </li>
<li>
            Moist climate: The moist and humid climate helped in the growth of cotton.
           </li>
<li>
            Transport: A good network of roads and railways helped in procuring raw materials and distribution of finished products.
           </li>
<li>
            Port facilities: The nearness to Mumbai port helped in the export of finished cotton products.
           </li>
<li>
            Cheap labour: Cheap labour was abundantly available in these states.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           OR
           <br/>
           Industries pollute the environment by polluting air, water and land. They also cause noise pollution. They have increased pollution and resulted in a degraded environment. The pollution created by industries can be classified as:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Land pollution: It is caused by dumping of non-biodegradable solid waste from industries in landfill sites.
           </li>
<li>
            Air pollution: Industries cause air pollution by the emission of gases from industrial complexes and power generation units. Leakage of poisonous gases and chemicals from chemical industries and burning of fossil fuels in big and small factories also leads to air pollution.
           </li>
<li>
            Water pollution: It is caused when industrial effluents both organic and inorganic are discharged into rivers or other water bodies. Some other common pollutants of the water pollution are fertilisers, pesticides, dyes, soaps, etc.
           </li>
<li>
            Noise pollution: Undesirable noise pollution from industries like construction, running of generators to generate power, electrical drill, etc., is responsible for disturbing our environment.
           </li>
<li>
            Thermal pollution: It occurs when hot water from factories and thermal plants is drained into rivers and ponds before cooling.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Question 33.
           <br/>
           Sumit visited a bank to take a home loan. However, the bank might not be willing to lend credit to him. What could be the
           <br/>
           possible reasons behind it? (5)
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Explain with an example how the terms of credit can be unfavourable for the small farmer. Also suggest some sources by which small farmers can get cheap credit. (3+2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The banks might not be willing to lend certain borrowers like Sumit due to the following reasons
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            A few people fail to provide the required set of documents to get a loan.
           </li>
<li>
            Some people have not repaid previous loans. Such borrowers are come in the defaulter’s list.
           </li>
<li>
            Banks might not be willing to lend them further.
           </li>
<li>
            The banks might not be willing to lend entrepreneurs who are going to invest in the business with high risks.
           </li>
<li>
            The banks might not be willing to lend those people who earn irregular incomes o have no fixed salary because in such cases chances of repayment of the loan are very less.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Or
           <br/>
           The terms of credit can be unfavourable for the small farmer, for exan,pe, if a farmer borrows money from the bank and during the harvest season his crops are ruined, then he shall not be able to repay the loan to the bank. He might have to sell a part of his land to repay the amount. In, such condition he will further fall into the debt trap The small farmers can get cheap credit from the different sources like banks, agricultural cooperatives, and Self-Help Groups (SHGs).

           <br/>
           Gutenberg was the son of a merchant and grew up on a large agricultural estate. From his childhood, he had seen wine and olive presses. Subsequently, he learned the art of polishing stones, became a master goldsmith, and also acquired the expertise to create lead molds used for making trinkets. Drawing on this knowledge, Gutenberg adapted existing technology to design his innovation. The olive press provided the model for the printing press, and moulds were used for casting the metal types for the letters of the alphabet. By 1448, Gutenberg perfected the system. The first book he printed was the Bible. About 180 copies were printed and it took three years to produce them. By the standards of the time this was fast production.

           The Chemical industry in India is fast growing and diversifying. It contributes approximately 3 percent of the GDP It is the third largest in Asia and occupies the twelfth place in the world in terms of its size. It comprises both large and small-scale manufacturing units.
          </p>
<p>
           Rapid growth has been recorded in both inorganic and organic sectors. Inorganic chemicals include sulphuric acid (used to manufacture fertilizers, synthetic fibers, plastics, adhesives, paints, dyes stuffs), nitric acid, alkalis, soda ash (used to make glass, soaps and detergents, paper), and caustic soda. These industries are widely spread over the country Organic chemicals include petrochemicals, which are used for manufacturing of synthetic fibers, synthetic rubber, plastics, dyestuffs, drugs, and pharmaceuticals.
          </p>
<p>
           Organic chemical plants are located near oil refineries or petrochemical plants. The chemical industry is its own largest consumer. Basic chemicals undergo processing to further produce other chemicals that are used for industrial applications, agriculture, or directly for consumer markets.
           <br/>

           Question 36.
           <br/>
           Read the given extract and answer the following questions.
           <br/>
           Belgium and Sri Lanka both are democracies. Yet, they dealt with the question of power-sharing differently. In Belgium, the leaders have realized that the unity of the country is possible only by respecting the feelings and interests of different communities and regions. Such a realization resulted in mutually acceptable arrangements for sharing power. Sri Lanka shows us a contrasting example. It shows us that if a majority community wants to force its dominance over others and refuses to share power, it can undermine the unity of the country.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 36.1
           <br/>
           How was the power-sharing arrangement in Belgium different from that of in Sri Lanka?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In Belgium, the leaders amended the constitution four times to enable everyone to live together within the same country, whereas in Sri Lanka, the Sinhala community adopted majoritarian measures to establish its supremacy over the Sri Lankan Tamils.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 36.2
           <br/>
           Explain why power sharing is desirable.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Prudential Reason: Power sharing ensures the stability of political order. Moral Reason: A democratic rule involves sharing power with those affected by its exercise, and who have to live with its effects.
