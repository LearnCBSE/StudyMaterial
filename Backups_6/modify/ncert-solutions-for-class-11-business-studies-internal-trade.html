<strong>
            Question 1. What is meant by internal trade?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Internal trade refers to the buying and selling of goods and services within the domestic territory of a country. It is known as internal trade. In other words, the process of exchanging goods and services within the national boundaries of a country is called internal trade. Purchases of goods from a local shop, a mall or an exhibition are all examples of internal trade. The government does not levy customs or import duties on goods and services that are produced within the country for meeting the domestic demand.
           <br/>
           Internal trade can be classified into the following two categories:
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
             Retail Trade:
            </strong>
            It refers to the buying and selling of goods in small quantities for final consumption.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Wholesale Trade:
            </strong>
            It refers to the buying and selling of goods in bulk, i.e., the exchange of large quantities of goods meant for resale in local markets.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
            Question 2. Specify the characteristics of fixed shop retailers.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           As the name suggests, fixed-shop retailers are retailers who have permanent establishments. It means that they sell goods and services from fixed shops and do not move from place to place to serve customers. For example, retailers functioning from fixed establishments in the local grocery market.
           <br/>
           The following are some of the characteristics of fixed-shop retailers:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Fixed-shop retailers operate on a large scale and have huge resources at their disposal compared with itinerant traders. However, among fixed-shop retailers, there are retailers who operate on a small scale or a large scale.
           </li>
<li>
            They generally deal in more than one product—that is, their range of goods varies from consumer durable goods to non-durable goods.
           </li>
<li>
            Fixed-shop retailers provide services such as free home delivery and supply of goods on credit to their customers.
           </li>
<li>
            They have a greater credibility in the eyes of consumer as they can be traced if the product is found to be defective or there is any other problem.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
            Question 3. What purpose is served by wholesalers providing warehousing facilities?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Wholesalers purchase goods in bulk from manufacturers, store them and distribute them to retailers in small quantities for further resale. This bulk purchase of goods enables manufacturers to undertake production on a large scale without worrying about storage facilities. By offering warehouses close to the centres of distribution, wholesalers provide what is known as ‘place utility’. Wholesalers not only provide warehousing facilities such as collection, storage and protection of goods but also facilitate marketing and distribution, creating ‘time utility.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            Question 4. How does market information provided by wholesalers benefit the manufacturers?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Wholesalers provide a variety of information to both manufacturers and customers. To manufacturers, they provide information about:
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<ol>
<li>
            The tastes and preferences of customers
           </li>
<li>
            Conditions prevailing in the market
           </li>
<li>
            Level of competition in the market and
           </li>
<li>
            Types of goods and features demanded by consumers.
            <br/>
            This information helps manufacturers to cater to the changing needs of consumers.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
            Question 5. How do the wholesalers help the manufacturer in availing the economies of scale?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Wholesalers often purchase goods in bulk quantities from manufacturers. Once a purchase is made, the wholesalers distribute the goods in small quantities to retailers for further resale. However, during this process, they provide manufacturers with a variety of warehousing facilities such as collection, storage, marketing and distribution of goods. These services reduce the burden on manufacturers by creating time and place utility, thus enabling them to produce goods on a large scale and benefit from the economies of scale.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            Question 6. Distinguish between single line stores and specialty stores. Can you identify such stores in your locality?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Single-line stores are small shops that deal in only one product. For example, garments or shoes. However, single-line stores offer a wide variety of the product. For instance, a single-line store that deals in garments will have a wide variety of clothes in all sizes for men, women and children.
           <br/>
           On the other hand, specialty stores deal only in a particular type of product from a selected product line. For example, men’s clothing. Such stores generally sell all the brands of the product in which they specialise. For instance, if a store specialises in men’s clothing, then it will have all the brands of men’s garments.
           <br/>
           On the basis of these features, we can identify the different types of stores in a locality—whether they are single-line stores or specialty stores.
           <br/>
           Single line stores are more frequently found in local retail markets while specialty stores are found in wholesale markets.
          </p>

            Question 7. How would you differentiate between street traders and street shops?

            Answer:
           </strong>
           Wholesalers offer a wide variety of services to manufacturers. The following are examples of such services:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>

This bulk purchase made by wholesalers enables manufacturers to undertake production on a large scale without worrying about storage facilities. Thus, wholesalers facilitate large-scale production.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             They provide storage facilities:

            When wholesalers purchase goods in bulk quantities from manufacturers, they store these goods in their god owns or warehouses, reducing manufacturers burden of finding proper storage .
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             They collect market information:
            </strong>
            Wholesalers provide different kinds of information to manufacturers, such as information about the tastes and preferences of customers, prevailing market conditions, level of competition in the market and type of goods demanded by consumers. This in turn helps manufacturers to produce goods according to the market needs.
           </li>
</ol>

             II. Long Answer Type Questions

<strong>
            Question 1. Itinerant traders have been an integral part of internal trade in India. Analyse the reasons for their survival in spite of competition from large scale retailers.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Itinerant traders are retailers who do not have a fixed place of operation. That is, they do not have a shop from where they sell their products. They are also known as mobile traders as they keep moving from place to place in order to sell their products. They are generally found on street sides, and they shift their place of operation in search of more customers. They usually sell low-priced and non-standard goods.
           <br/>
           The reasons that itinerant traders survive in spite of the tough competition from large-scale retailers can be attributed to the following factors:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            It is very easy to set up a small scale retail shop. One person with limited funds himself can start business. He need not associate other persons and no formalities are necessary.
           </li>
<li>
            A small scale retail shop can be located anywhere. It can provide goods of daily use near the place of consumers. They are not required to travel to big markets.
           </li>
<li>
            The small scale retailer knows his customers. He can attend to them personally and cater to their individual tastes and needs. Such personalised service is not available in large scale retail stores.
           </li>
<li>
            Small scale retailers cater to the masses that have limited income and can afford to buy small quantity. In India majority of the population is poor.
           </li>
<li>
            It is easy to manage and control a small sale retail shop. The owner himself is the manager. He has direct motivation to work hard and increase the efficiency of business. He takes personal interest in his business organisations.
           </li>
<li>
            Small amount of capital is required to start a small retail shop. People with small amount of funds can start retail business on a small scale.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
            Question 2. Discuss the features of a departmental store. How are they different from multiple shops or chain stores?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Departmental stores are basically large, fixed establishments that deal in a wide variety of products. The following points highlight the features of a departmental store:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
             Central locations:
            </strong>
            Department stores are generally located in central areas so as to attract a large number of customers.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Defined hierarchy:
            </strong>
            The management in departmental stores follows the same hierarchy that is generally followed in any joint stock company. That is, the top management consists of a board of directors, with the managing director, the general manager and the department managers under it in that order.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Absence of middlemen:
            </strong>
            Departmental stores purchase goods directly from manufacturers and sell them to customers. Thus, they eliminate the role of middlemen.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Centralised purchase with decentralised sales:
            </strong>
            In a departmental store, the purchases from manufacturers are handled by a single division that follows a centralised purchase policy. On the other hand, the sales are handled by the respective sections of the departmental store, which follow a decentralised policy for sales.

<strong>
            Question 3. Why are consumers cooperative stores considered to be less expensive? What are its relative advantages over other large scale retailers?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Consumer cooperative stores are formed by groups of consumers to provide goods at reasonable prices to members of consumer societies. In such societies, the role of middlemen is eliminated as these societies purchase goods from manufacturers or wholesalers directly and sell them to society members at reasonable rates. As consumer cooperative stores do not aim at profit-making, the prices of goods offered by them are much lower than the prices of goods at retail shops. Compared with large-scale retailers, the capital requirement for starting a consumer cooperative society is very low. Thus, consumer cooperative stores do not require much investment, and the goods sold by them are priced lower.
           <br/>
           The following are some advantages that consumer cooperative stores have over large- scale retailers:
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
             Democratic management:
            </strong>
            Consumer cooperative stores are democratic organisations as they are managed and controlled by elected managing committees of consumer societies. The members of managing committees are elected by the members of consumer societies on the principle of ‘one member, one vote’.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Limited liability:
            </strong>
            The liability of the members of consumer cooperative societies is limited to the amount of shares held by them. Thus, in case a society’s liabilities increase beyond the assets, the members will not be liable to repay the debts using their personal assets.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Low price of goods:
            </strong>
            As the goods offered by consumer cooperatives are directly purchased from manufacturers and wholesalers, the role of middlemen is eliminated. Therefore, consumer societies are able to sell goods at lower prices.
           </li>

            Question 4. What is the difference between a hawker and a peddler?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
<strong>
            Hawkers:
           </strong>
           A hawker moves about in residential localities. He carries his goods in a hand cart or bicycle. He deals in low-priced goods of daily use. For example, combs, toys, soaps, mirrors, bangles, vegetables, fruits, ice-cream, etc.
           <br/>
<strong>
            Peddlers:
           </strong>
           A peddler also moves from house to house and sells articles of daily use.
           <br/>
           But he carries his wares on his head or on the back of a mule.
           <br/>
           Therefore, the basic difference between the two is that hawker has a cycle or cart to carry his goods while peddlar carries his goods on heads. So we can say that financially, peddler is weaker than hawker.

The person who undertakes such a trade is known as wholesaler. The wholesaler acts as an intermediary between the producer and the retailer. He is known as the first intermediary in the channel of distribution. The wholesaler distributes business works amongst the members of the staff in such a way that the whole enterprise may work as a complete unit. The distribution of work should be done in such a manner as to yield maximum efficiency at minimum troubles.

           The differences between departmental stores and multiple shops are summarized below:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
             Location:
            </strong>
            A departmental store is centrally located and attracts customers towards it. On the other hand, multiple shops are situated in different localities and attempt to reach near the customers.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Variety of goods:
            </strong>
            A departmental store deals in a wide variety of products and serves as a universal supplier. On the other hand, a multiple shop specialises in one line of goods.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Type of customers:
            </strong>
            A departmental store caters mainly to rich people, whereas multiple shops cater to the general public.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Nature of dealings:
            </strong>
            A departmental store sells goods both on cash and credit basis. But multiple shops sell goods on cash and carry basis.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Services:
            </strong>
            A departmental store offers banking, post office, restaurant and other facilities to customers. Multiple shops do not offer such services.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Pricing:
            </strong>
            Different departments of a departmental store may sell goods at different prices. But all the multiple shops sell goods at the same prices.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Decoration and display:
            </strong>

<li>
<strong>
             Object:

           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Ownership:
            </strong>

<li>
<strong>
             Risk:
            </strong>

            By selling under his own brand name the wholesaler often relieves the manufacturer of the need to advertise his product.
           </li>
<li>
            The wholesaler removes goods in larger quantities as they are produced, thus clearing the production lines.
           </li>
<li>
            By warehousing the goods the wholesaler bridges the time gap between production and consumption, leaving the manufacturer free to concentrate on his specialised activities.
           </li>
<li>
            He eliminates the need for a marketing system with all that involves in terms of warehousing space, distribution network, sales staff, accounting records, and debt collection.
           </li>
<li>
            By paying promptly the wholesaler reduces the working capital required by the manufacturers.

<strong>
            Question 3. What difficulties will be faced by the consumers if retailers are eliminated from the chain?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           If retailers are removed, it will lead to direct marketing. In general, you cannot save money by “eliminating the middleman” because intermediaries specialize in performing certain tasks that they can perform more cheaply than the manufacturer. Most grocery products are most efficiently sold to the consumer through retail stores that take a modest mark-up—it would not make sense for manufacturers to ship their grocery products in small quantities directly to consumers.
           <br/>
           Intermediaries perform tasks such as
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Moving the goods efficiently (e.g., large quantities are moved from factories or warehouses to retail stores);
           </li>
<li>
            Breaking bulk (manufacturers sell to a modest number of wholesalers in large quantities—quantities are then gradually broken down as they make their way toward the consumer);
           </li>
<li>
            Consolidating goods (retail stores carry a wide assortment of goods from different manufacturers—e.g., super markets span from toilet paper to catsup); and Aiding services (e.g., demonstrations and repairs).
           </li>
<li>
            If these middlemen are eliminated, they will face absence of these functions which will be troublesome for them.
           </li>
</ol>

            Question 4. Explain important terms used in context of internal trade.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           The following are the main terms used in the internal trade.
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
             Cash on delivery (COD):
            </strong>
            It refers to a type of transaction in which payment for goods or services is made at the time of delivery. If the buyer is unable to make payment when the goods or services are delivered, then it will be returned to the seller.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Free on Board or Free on Rail (FOB or FOR):
            </strong>
            It refers to a contract between the seller and the buyer in which all the expenses up to the point of delivery to a carrier (it may be a ship, rail, lorry, etc.) are to be borne by seller.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF):
            </strong>
            It is the price of goods which includes not only the cost of goods but also the insurance and freight charges payable on goods.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             E and OE (Errors and Omissions Expected):
            </strong>
            It refers to that term which is used in trade documents to say that mistakes and things that have been forgotten should be taken into account. This term is used in an attempt to reduce legal liability for incorrect or incomplete information supplied in a document such as price list, invoice, cash memo, quotation etc.

             V. Value Based Questions
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<strong>
            Question 1. Peddlers and hawkers create traffic indiscipline and therefore it must be declared as illegal. Do you agree? Justify your answer.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           I do not agree. In India it is the most visible segment of the urban informal economy. It is indisputable that there are thousands—and in some cases, tens or hundreds of thousands—of street vendors in most big cities of the developing world. Yet it is exceedingly difficult to produce accurate estimates of the number of street traders in any given city. In some countries, official statistics on street vendors are available, though they underestimate the total number of people engaged in street vending. Without providing them an alternative employment, we cannot think of making it illegal. Yes, for security reasons, they may be asked to get an ID with them or they may be issued a pass by local authorities.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            Question 2. Which retail shops are rim by the weaker sections? Do you think they are capable to face competition from large scale retail shops? How do they exist then?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Weaker sections of society run retail shops in following ways:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
             Hawkers and Peddlers:
            </strong>
            The hawkers carry their goods in a wheeled vehicle while the peddlers carry the goods on their heads or backs.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Market Traders:
            </strong>
            These retailers open their shops at different places on fixed days.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Street Traders or Pavement Vendors:
            </strong>
            These retailers display their goods at busy street corners or pavements.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Cheap Jacks:
            </strong>
            These retailers generally hire a small shop in a residential colony for a temporary period.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           No, they are not capable to face competition from large scale retailers. In fact there I do not have to face competition from large scale retailers because their clientele is different from them. Poor and lower middle class people buy from small retail shops while upper middle class and rich people buy from large scale retail shops. Therefore, they can manage to exist due to following advantages over large scale retail shops.
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            A small scale retailer himself looks after his business. He is not required to employ managers or to spend on advertising, etc. Therefore, he can sell goods at lower prices.
           </li>
<li>
            A small scale retailer can take quick decisions. He is not required to consult others.
           </li>
<li>
            A small scale retailer can easily adjust his stocks according to the changing needs and fashions of his customers.
           </li>
<li>
            A small scale retailer can more easily maintain secrecy of his business affairs.
           </li>
</ul>
