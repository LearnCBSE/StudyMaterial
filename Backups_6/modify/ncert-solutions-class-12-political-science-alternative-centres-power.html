           After the end of Second World War in 1945, the European States confronted the ruin of their economies and the destruction of assumptions and structures on which Europe had been founded. European countries resolved their Post Second World War problems in the following manner:
           <br/>
           1. Under the ‘Marshall Plan’ the USA provided financial help to revive European economy.
           <br/>
           2. The US also created a new collective security structure under NATO.
           <br/>
           3. Under the ‘Marshall Plan’ the organisation for European Economic Cooperation was established in 1948 to extend cooperation on trade and economic issues among the Western European States.
           <br/>
           4. European Union was founded in 1992 for a common foreign and security policy, cooperation on justice and home affairs and creation of a single currency. It evolved from an economic union to political one over time.
           <br/>
           The following attempts led to the formation of European Union:
           <br/>
           1. The Council of Europe was established in 1949 for political cooperation.
           <br/>
           2. The process of economic integration of European Capitalist countries led to the formation of European Economic Community in 1957.
           <br/>
           3. The above mentioned processes acquired a political dimension with the creation of European Parliament.
           <br/>
           4. The collapse of Soviet bloc put Europe on a fast track and resulted in the establishment of European Union in 1992.

           The Indo-China relations experience strategically organised as rising economic powers in global politics and to play a major role in Asian economy after the end of Cold War. It can be proved on the following grounds:
           <br/>
           1. The new economic policies of India and China have broken their economy from stagnancy.
           <br/>
           2. The creation of special economic zones led to a phenomenal rise in foreign trade.
           <br/>
           3. China has become the most important destination for foreign direct investment anywhere in the world. Hence, it has large reserves for foreign exchange to allow it to make big investment in other countries.
           <br/>
           4. At the global level also, India and China have adopted similar policies in World Trade Organisation to deepen integration with the world economy to challenge unipolar world.

           2. ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) maintains coordination of security and foreign policy.

           The relations with China experience friendly gestures from India as India signed popular ‘Panchsheel’ to develop Indo-China relations in 1954 and advocated China’s membership to the United Nations. Still, after 1957, various contentious issues arose in Indo-China relations:
           <br/>
           1. In 1962, military conflict over a border dispute of MacMohan Line resulted on unwarranted claim by China which now lie in Arunachal Pradesh and Aksai Chin region of Ladakh.
           <br/>
           2. Differences arose from Chinese take over of Tibet in 1950 which was protested by India against China.
           <br/>
           3. After Panchsheel, attack by China on India in 1962, to occupy larger territories of India, created humiliation.
           <br/>
           4. China’s assistance to Pakistan’s nuclear programme also created differences.
           <br/>
           5. China’s military relations with Bangladesh and Myanmar were viewed as hostile to Indian interests.
           <br/>
           All the above mentioned differences/ disputes could be resolved for greater cooperation-
           <br/>
           1. Both the countries should make some more efforts to revive harmonious attitude between themselves.
           <br/>
           2. Both the countries should move hand-in-hand to fight against terrorism, nuclear race and economic disparities.
           <br/>
           3. Both the countries should develop understanding and respect.
           <br/>
           4. Hence, both of them have signed agreements on cultural exchange and cooperation in science and technology.

           Indo-China war of 1962 had complicated Indo-China relations. After 1976 the relations began to improve slowly because:
           <br/>
           1. China’s policy became more pragmatic and less ideological due to change in China’s political leadership in the late 1970s when China got ready to settle the contentious issues.

           2. A series of talks to resol ve the border issues were also initiated to develop harmonious relations.

</span>
           The European Union has evolved over time from an economic union to an increasingly political one. The EU has started to act more as a nation state. While the attempts to have a constitution for the EU have failed, it has its own flag, anthem, founding date, and currency. It also has some form of a common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations. The European Union has tried to expand areas of cooperation while acquiring new members, especially from the erstwhile Soviet bloc. The process has not proved easy, for people in many countries are not very enthusiastic in giving the EU powers that were exercised by the government of their country. There are also reservations about including some new countries within the European Union.

<strong>
            ASEAN was and still remains principally an economic association. While the ASEAN region as a whole is a much smaller economy compared to the US the EU, and Japan, its economy is growing much faster than all these. This accounts for the growth in its influence both in the region and beyond. The objectives of the ASEAN Economic Community are to create a common market and production base within ASEAN States and to aid social and economic development in the region. The Economic Community would also like to improve the existing ASEAN Dispute Settlement Mechanism to resolve economic disputes. ASEAN has focused on creating a Free Trade Area (FTA) for investment, labour, and services. The US and China have already moved fast to negotiate FTAs with ASEAN.

           <br/>
           The conflict of 1962, in which India suffered military reverses, had long-term implications for India-China relations. Diplomatic relations between the two countries were downgraded until 1976. Thereafter, relltions between the two countries began to improve slowly. After the change in China’s political leadership from the mid to late 1970s, China’s policy became more pragmatic and less ideological. So it was prepared to, put off the settlement of contentious issues while improving relations with India. A series of talks to resolve the border issue were also initiated in 1981.

           <br/>
