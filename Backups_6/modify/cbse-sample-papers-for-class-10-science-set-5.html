           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Water &lt; acetic acid &lt; hydrochloric acid
           <br/>
           Hydrochloric acid is a mineral acid and ionizes completely in water, that’s why it is a strong acid. Acetic acid is an organic acid and ionizes only partially in the water, hence, it is a weak acid. Water is neutral. Thus, the order of acidity is water &lt; acetic acid &lt; hydrochloric acid.

           <br/>
           (B) is correct
           <br/>
           Explanation: Trypsin breaks down proteins into smaller peptides in the duodenum of the small intestine. Pepsin is a stomach enzyme that serves to digest proteins found in ingested food. Lipase is an enzyme the body uses to break down fats in food so they can be absorbed in the intestines. Amylase helps your body break down starches.

           Question 11.
           <br/>
           Select the correct option regarding the movement shown by Mimosa Pudica.
           <br/>
           (a) The movement is non-directional and occurs due to turgor changes.
           <br/>
           (b) The movement is an immediate response to a stimulus.
           <br/>
           (c) The movement is in response to touch and is called xyctinasty.
           <br/>
           (d) The movement is non-directional and involves growth.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The movement is non-directional and occurs due to turgor changes.
           <br/>
           The leaves of Mimosa pudica respond to stimuli such as touch, blow or mechanical shack by folding their leaflets and lowering their leaves. This effect is caused by a change in the turgidity of the leaflets brought about by the movement of water into and out of the parenchymatous cells of the swollen leaf base.

           <br/>
           (c) Refraction, dispersion, and internal reflection
           <br/>
           (d) Dispersion, scattering, and total internal reflection
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (c) Refraction, dispersion and internal reflection
           <br/>
           A rainbow is caused by dispersion, refraction, and internal reflection of sunlight by tiny water droplets, present in the atmosphere and always formed in a direction opposite to that of the sun. The water droplets act like small prisms. They refract and disperse the incident sunlight, then reflect it internally, and finally refract it again when it comes out of the raindrop.

           Question 17.
           <br/>
           Assertion (A): Carbon shows maximum catenation property in the periodic table.
           <br/>
           Reason (R): Carbon has a small size and thus, forms a strong C—C bond.

           Question 18.
           <br/>
           Assertion (A): Amoeba takes in food using finger like extensions of the cell surface.
           <br/>
           Reason (R): In all unicellular organisms, the food is taken in by the entire cell surface.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (C) A is true but R is false.
           <br/>
           Explanation: Amoeba takes in food using temporary finger-like extensions of the cell surface, called pseudopodia, which extend and fuse over the food particle forming a food vacuole. Inside the food vacuole, complex substances are broken down into simpler ones which then diffuse into the cytoplasm. A unicellular organism does not need a specific organ for taking in food, because the entire surface of the organism is in contact with the environment.

           Question 20.
           <br/>
           Assertion (A): Greater number of individuals is present in lower trophic levels.
           <br/>
           Reason (R): The flow of energy is unidirectional.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (B) Both A and R are true, and R is not the correct explanation of A.
           <br/>
           Explanation: There are generally a greater number of individuals at the lower trophic levels of an ecosystem; the greatest number is of the producers. The flow of energy in an ecosystem is always linear or unidirectional. The energy captured from producers does not revert solar input. Also, the energy that passes to the herbivores does not come back to autotrophs.

           In the experimental set up on CO
           <sub>
            2

           is released during respiration’, if one forgets to keep the vial with KOH in the conical flask, how will the result vary? Give details.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In the absence of KOH, CO
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           released by germinating seeds is not absorbed, a partial vacuum is not created in the conical flask, air pressure in the flask is not reduced, and the water level does not rise in the delivery tube.
           <br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Detailed Answer:
           </strong>
<br/>
           The rise in the level of water indicates that CO
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           is produced by germinating seeds during respiration. The germinating seeds respire and produce C02, which is absorbed by KOH solution. This creates a vacuum in the conical flask. The air present in the bent glass tube moves into the conical flask. This pulls the water in the bent tube further up.
           <br/>
           So, if one forgets to keep the vial with KOH solution in a conical flask during an experiment, then the released CO
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           will not be absorbed due to which the level of water will not rise in the tube and the process of respiration will get very slow.

           Question 23.
           <br/>
           List the components and functions of transport systems in highly organized plants.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Explain, why the transportation of materials is necessary for animals.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The main components of the transport system in highly organized plants are the xylem and phloem. These can be explained as
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            The xylem consists of tracheids and vessels. It conducts water and minerals (obtained from the soil) to the leaves. (1)
           </li>
<li>
            Phloem consists of sieve tubes and companion cells. It helps to transport food materials, etc. from leaves to various parts of the plant. (1)
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Or
           <br/>
           The distribution of all essential substances such as food, oxygen, and water throughout the body is carried out through the system of transportation. It also displaces excretory wastes collected from the cells of the body to the excretory organs from where they are expelled from the body. Thus, transportation of materials is necessary to carry out various life processes. (2)

<br/>
           Since the refractive index of the liquid is equal to that of the material of the lens, the light rays do not undergo refraction as they pass from the liquid to the lens and back into the liquid.

           From the figure given above, explain the phenomena of advanced sunrise and delayed sunset.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Given, image distance, v = +50 cm
           <br/>
           Magnification, m = -1 [∵ image is inverted]
           <br/>
           m = \(\frac{v}{u}\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ u = \(\frac{v}{m}=\frac{50}{-1}\) = -50 cm (1)
           <br/>
           So, the needle is placed 50 cm in front of the lens.
           <br/>
           By lens formula, \(\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{v}-\frac{1}{u}\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ \(\frac{1}{50}-\frac{1}{(-50)}\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ \(\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{25}\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ f = 25 cm = 0.25 m
           <br/>
           ∴ Power of convex lens, P = \(\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{0.25}\) = 4 D (1)

           Advanced sunrise and delayed sunset: The figure shows the actual position of the Sun S at the time of sunrise and S’ the apparent position of the Sun. The advanced sunrise and delayed sunset are because of atmospheric refraction. The light rays starting from the Sun travel from rarer to denser layers. They bend more and more towards the normal. (1)
          </p>
<p>
           However, an observer on the Earth sees an object in the direction of the rays reaching his eyes. The Sun which is actually in a position below the horizon, appears in the position S’ above the horizon for him. Thus, the Sun appears to rise early by about 2 minutes and set late by about 2 minutes. This increases the length of the day by about 4 minutes. (1)

           Question 29.
           <br/>
           How is the sex of a child determined in human beings?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A male germ cell that forms gametes carries one X and one Y chromosome, while a female germ cell carries two X chromosomes. Therefore, the sex of the child depends upon what happens during fertilization. (1)
           <br/>
           (a) If a sperm carrying an X-chromosome fertilizes the egg, the child born will be a female (XX). (1/2)
           <br/>
           (b) If a sperm carrying a Y-chromosome fertilizes the egg, the child born will be a male (XY). (1/2)
           <br/>
           Thus, the sperm (the male gamete) determines the sex of the child. (1)

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Changes in the fertilised egg:
           <br/>
           (i) Zygote/fertilised egg start dividing.
           <br/>
           (ii) Implantation of the zygote in the inner uterine wall.
           <br/>
           (iii) Embryo starts growing with the help of the placenta which results in the development of the child.
           <br/>
           (iv) Birth of a child as a result of rhythmic contraction of the muscles in the uterus.
           <br/>
           When an egg is not fertilized, the inner lining of the uterus slowly breaks and comes out through the vagina as blood and mucous (Menstruation).

           (b) Write an expression for the amount of heat produced in a resistor when an electric current is passed through it stating the meanings of the symbols used.
           <br/>
           (c) Name two appliances based on the heating effect of electric current,
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) When electricity is supplied to a purely resistive conductor, the energy of electric current gets dissipated entirely in the form of heat. As a result, the resistor gets heated. The heating of a resistor because of the dissipation of electrical energy is known as the heating effect of electric current.
           <br/>
           (b) When an electric current I passes through the conductor, the amount of heat produced in time t is:
           <br/>
           H = Vlt
           <br/>
           Since, V = IR
           <br/>
           So, H = l

           Question 33.
           <br/>
           Some modern insecticides have been introduced each having different properties like accumulation in the bodies of predators, broken down by soil bacteria, easily washed into lakes and rivers, and taken up by plant roots. Among all these insecticides, which one will help in reducing or keeping the level of environmental pollution to the lowest?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Insecticides are non-biodegradable chemicals added to crop fields to stop the growth of insects infecting the crops. Modern insecticides are being developed keeping in mind, the harm they cause to the environment and its components. (1)
          </p>
<p>
           Biodegradable insecticides can be decomposed into harmless substances, which will subsequently be dispersed in their specific pathways and cause no pollution. Non-biodegradable insecticides build up in the fat tissues of the body and pass on to organisms that feed on them. (1)
          </p>
<p>
           Hence, they accumulate along the food chain resulting in significant amounts in the tissues of consumers at the highest trophic level. This is called biomagnification. The property of newly developed insecticides which includes that they can easily get decomposed into simpler components by soil bacteria, will help in reducing or keeping the level of environmental pollution to the lowest.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The focal length of the convex lens can be calculated from S.No. 3 as when an object is placed at a distance from the convex lens, its image is formed on the other side of the lens at the same distance from the lens. So, the focal length is + 20 cm.
           <br/>
           (b) S.No. 6 is incorrect as the object distance is between the focus and pole and here the real image is formed as the image distance is positive. But in such situation, virtual image should form.
           <br/>
           (c) Approximate value of magnification for object distance – 60 cm and image distance +30 cm is -0.5.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) It is a convex mirror. So focal length should be positive.
           <br/>
           Radius of curvature R = + 5 m

           Question 38.
           <br/>
           Mendel blended his knowledge of science and mathematics to keep the count of the individuals exhibiting a particular trait in each generation. He observed several contrasting visible characters controlled in pea plants in the field. He conducted many experiments to arrive at the laws of inheritance.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           If 1600 plants were obtained in F2 progeny, the number of plants having traits will be:
           <br/>
           (i) Tall plants with round seeds = 9/16 × 1600 = 900
           <br/>
           (ii) Short plants with wrinkled seeds = 1/16 × 1600 = 100
           <br/>
           The conclusion of the above experiment states the “Law of independent assortment”. This law states that the alleles of two (or more) different genes get sorted into gametes independently of one another.

           Question 39.

<img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 10 Science Set 8 with Solutions Q39" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-152192" height="108" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-Science-Set-8-with-Solutions-Q39.png" width="244"/>
<br/>
           In an experiment, the formation of an image for an object AB placed in front of a convex lens is shown above in the figure, with an incomplete ray diagram.
           <br/>
           (a) Based on text data given in the above paragraph, if the object is placed at infinity, then where is the position of the image formed by the lens?
           <br/>
           (b) What is the nature and size of the image formed by the convex lens?
           <br/>
           (c) For the given position of an object in the figure, where will be the image formed?
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           If the focal length of the lens is 8 cm and an object is placed at 12 cm from the optical center, then find the position of the image formed.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The convex lens has the property to converge the parallel beam of light rays at 4 points, i.e., the focus of the lens. Hence, the image will be formed at the focus. (1)
           <br/>
           (b) In this case, the nature of the image formed by a convex lens is virtual and erect. The size of the image is larger than that of the object, i.e. magnified image will be formed. (1)
           <br/>
           (c) The formation of the image is as shown below:
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 10 Science Set 8 with Solutions Q39.1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-152191" height="269" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-Science-Set-8-with-Solutions-Q39.1.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-Science-Set-8-with-Solutions-Q39.1.png 365w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-Science-Set-8-with-Solutions-Q39.1-300x221.png 300w" width="365"/>
<br/>
           Hence, the position of the image is beyond 2F1 on the same side of the object. (2)
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Given, the focal length of the lens, f = 8 cm
           <br/>
           Object distance, u = -12 cm
           <br/>
           Using lens formula, \(\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{v}-\frac{1}{u}\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ \(\frac{1}{8}=\frac{1}{v}-\frac{1}{-12}\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ \(\frac{1}{v}=\frac{1}{24}\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ v = 24 cm
           <br/>
           Hence, the image will be formed at a distance of 24 cm from the optical centre. (2)
