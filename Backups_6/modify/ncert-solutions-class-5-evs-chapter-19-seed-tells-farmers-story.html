<strong>
             1.The bajra seed saw differences in the way Damjibhai and Hasmukh did farming
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #993366;">
<strong>
             (for example, in irrigation, ploughing, etc.). What were these differences?
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #339966;">
<strong>
             Ans.
            </strong>
</span>
           Damjibhai did farming in a different way than how Hasmukh did.
           <br/>
           Damjibhai followed the traditional methods of farming. He used bullocks to plough the field. He stored grains to be used as seeds. Hasmukh, on the other hand started using new methods of farming. He bpught a tractor to plough the field. He also bought a motorcycle. He stopped grdwing those crops which did not fetch good price in the market. He need not store grains to be used as seeds because he could buy seeds from the market. Expensive fertilizers were used for farming.
          </p>
<p>
<span style="color: #993366;">
<strong>
             2.Hasmukh said, “With profits from our fields, we can progress”. What is your understanding of ‘progress’?
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #339966;">
<strong>
             Ans.
            </strong>
</span>
           Progress means a better lifestyle. People get better houses to live in. They get more nutritious food to eat. Children get better schooling. Houses have all modern gadgets like TV, fridge, radio, etc. People may buy a vehicle for personal transport.

<strong>
             Ans.

           I would like to see following progress in my area:
           <br/>
           (a) Better roads
           <br/>
           (b) All around cleanliness with no overflowing drain
           <br/>
           (c) A good public transport system
           <br/>
           (d) A big park and playground where children can play and others can do some recreation.

<strong>
            Discuss and Think

<span style="color: #993366;">
<strong>
             1.What can happen to Hasmukh’s farm after some years?
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #339966;">
<strong>
             Ans.
            </strong>
</span>
           Hasmukh’s farm will lose fertility after some years because Hasmukh is using chemical fertilizers. Hasmukh is in danger of falling in debt trap as he has taken loans to buy tractor, seeds and fertilizers. In future he may not be able to properly work on his farm.
          </p>
<p>
<span style="color: #993366;">
<strong>
             2.Damjibhai’s son Hasmukh chose to become a farmer like his father, Hasmukh’s son Paresh is not a farmer, but a truck driver. Why would he have done so?
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #339966;">
<strong>
             Ans.
            </strong>
</span>
           Paresh could see that his father was running into losses. Farming had become a capital intensive activity with little profit. Hence, Paresh would have decided to switch to a new occupation.
          </p>
<p>
<span style="color: #993366;">
<strong>
             3.The seeds were not sure that what Hasmukh was talking about was really progress? What do you feel?
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #339966;">
<strong>
             Ans.
            </strong>
<span style="color: #000000;">
             I think the seed
            </span>
</span>
           s were correct in their thinking. New method of agriculture tend to overexploit the soil and other resources. This leads to loss of fertility of soil which may result in the land becoming barren. Too much irrigation depletes the groundwater and thus leaves little water for future. A machine can do the work of many people which leaves many people jobless.
           <br/>
           Apparently it looks like progress, but it is not the real progress.
          </p>
<p>
<span style="color: #993366;">
<strong>
             4.Have there been any changes near your area, which may be difficult to call ‘progress’? What changes are these? What are the different opinions about them?
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #339966;">
<strong>
             Ans.
            </strong>
</span>
           Yes, there are many changes which may not be called progress in the real sense. Let us take example of growing number of vehicles on the road. More vehicles have made travel easier but it is also leading to air pollution. Similarly, many factories are coming up near some cities and villages. These factories produce goods for people but they also create lot of air and water pollution. Some machines have been invented which can do the job of thousands of people and thus make thousands of people jobless. Many gadgets in our home have made us dependent on them. We are becoming more lethargic.

           One of my friends has a farm on the outskirts of the city. There is a big house at one edge of the farm. The house has a big courtyard. There is a tractor, a threshing machine and many small farm equipments kept outside the house. There are 5-6 people who live permanently at my friend’s farm. They have been working on this farm since last many years. At present the whole farm is full of mustard crops. It presents a beautiful landscape of yellow and green colours. There is a small orchard also in the farm. It has trees of many fruits like mango, guava, pomegranate, lemon, etc. I can also see many packets of synthetic fertilizers kept in the farmhouse. There are some jars of insecticides kept in a comer.

<strong>
             Ans.
            </strong>
</span>
           In most of the households, making dough does not involve using technologies. Ladies simply use the age old method of kneading the dough by bare hands. Flour is usually sieved before making the dough. After that, water needs to be
           <br/>
           added to the flour. People usually estimate the required amount of water for making dough. After kneading for some time, the dough gets ready.

            What We Have Learnt
           </strong>
<br/>
<span style="color: #993366;">
<strong>
             1.There have been many changes over time, in our food. What can this mean? Use the seed story and what you know from your elders to explain.
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #339966;">
<strong>
             Ans.
            </strong>
</span>
           There have been many changes in our food. Earlier, people used to eat chapatti of different kinds of grains but now wheat is the main ingredient of chapatti. My mother says that when she was a child, her father used to buy wheat grains. The wheat grains were washed and dried in the sun. Then it was taken to a chakki to make flour. Now, we buy packed atta (flour) and I have seen wheat grains in pictures only. Most of the children of my age would not recognise a particular grain. For example; I was surprised when I learnt how does the rice grain look with cover on it.
           <br/>
           Many of us now use instant food, instead of traditional food. I think people will fipfget how to cook some of the traditional dishes.
          </p>
<p>
<span style="color: #993366;">
<strong>
             2.What would happen if all the farmers were to use only one kind of seed and grow only one kind of crop?
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #339966;">
<strong>
             Ans.
            </strong>
</span>
           It will be a scary situation. We cannot survive by eating just one kind of crop. We need dal and sabji, along with rice. We cannot eat a diet which contains only rice or only chapatti. We need many other food to satisfy our taste or also our nutritional needs.
