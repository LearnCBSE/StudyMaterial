          Wave Optics Class 12 Important Questions Very Short Answer Type
         </h3>
<p>
          Question 1.
          <br/>
          How does the fringe width of interference fringes change, when the whole apparatus of Young’s experiment is kept in a liquid of refractive index 1.3? (Delhi 2008)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
<img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 10 Wave Optics Class 12 Important Questions 1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-116064" height="157" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-10-Wave-Optics-Class-12-Important-Questions-1.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-10-Wave-Optics-Class-12-Important-Questions-1.png 374w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-10-Wave-Optics-Class-12-Important-Questions-1-300x126.png 300w" width="374"/>
<br/>
          Fringe width becomes yL times of its initial value.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 2.
          <br/>
          How does the angular separation of interference fringes change in Young’s experiment, if the distance between the slits is increased? (Delhi 2008)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
<img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 10 Wave Optics Class 12 Important Questions 2" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-116065" height="42" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-10-Wave-Optics-Class-12-Important-Questions-2.png" width="288"/>
<br/>
          When separation between two slits is increased, angular separation decreases.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 3.
          <br/>
          State the reason, why two independent sources of light cannot be considered as coherent sources. (Delhi 2008)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Two independent sources of light cannot be coherent. This is because light is emitted by individual atoms, when they return to ground state. Even the smallest source of light contains billions of atoms which obviously cannot emit light waves in the same phase.

<p>
          Question 4.
          <br/>
          How does the angle of minimum deviation of a glass prism vary, if the incident violet light is replaced with red light? (All India 2008)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
<img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 10 Wave Optics Class 12 Important Questions 3" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-116067" height="43" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 372px) 100vw, 372px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-10-Wave-Optics-Class-12-Important-Questions-3.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-10-Wave-Optics-Class-12-Important-Questions-3.png 372w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-10-Wave-Optics-Class-12-Important-Questions-3-300x35.png 300w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-10-Wave-Optics-Class-12-Important-Questions-3-360x43.png 360w" width="372"/>
<br/>
          When incident violet light is replaced with red light, the angle of minimum deviation of a glass decreases.
         </p>

          Question 28.
          <br/>
          State two conditions required for obtaining co-herent sources.
          <br/>
          In Young’s arrangement to produce interference pattern, show that dark and bright fringes appearing on the screen are equally spaced. (Comptt. Delhi 2009)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Two conditions for obtaining coherent sources: (0 Two sources should give monochromatic light.
          <br/>
          (ii) Coherent sources of light should be obtained from a single source by some device.
          <br/>
          The fringe width (dark and bright) is given by

          Question 29.
          <br/>
          Laser light of wavelength 640 nm incident on a pair of slits produces an interference pattern in which the bright fringes are separated by 7.2 mm. Calculate the wavelength of another source of light which produces interference fringes separated by 8.1 mm using same arrangement. Also find the minimum value of the order ‘n’ of bright fringe of shorter wavelength which coincides with that of the longer wavelength. (Comptt. All India 2012)
          <br/>

          Question 34.
          <br/>
          Answer the following questions :
          <br/>
          (i) In what way is diffraction from each slit related to the interference pattern in a double slit experiment?
          <br/>
          (ii) When a tiny circular obstacle is placed in the path of light from a distance source, a bright spot is seen at the centre of the shadow of the obstacle. Explain, why. (Comptt. All India 2013)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) Diffraction from each slit is related to interference pattern in a double slit experiment in the following ways :
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           The intensity of minima for diffraction is never zero, while for interference it is generally zero.
          </li>
<li>
           All bright fringes for diffraction are not of uniform intensity, while for interference, these are of uniform intensity
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          (ii) Waves from the distant source are diffracted by the edge of the circular obstacle and these diffracted waves interfere constructively at the centre of the obstacle’s shadow produc¬ing a bright spot.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 35.
          <br/>
          (a) Write the conditions under which light sources can be said to be coherent.
          <br/>
          (b) Why is it necessary to have coherent sources in order to produce an interference pattern? (Comptt. All India 2013)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Coherent sources of light. The sources of light, which emit continuously light waves of the same wavelength, same frequency and in same phase are called Coherent sources of light.
          <br/>
          Interference pattern is not obtained. This is because phase difference between the light waves emitted from two different sodium lamps will change continuously.
         </p>
<p>
          (b) Conditions for interference. The important conditions for obtaining interference of light are :
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           The two sources of light must be coherent. i.e. they should exist continuous waves of same wavelength or frequency.
          </li>
<li>
           The two sources should be monochromatic.
          </li>
<li>
           The phase difference of waves from two sources should be constant.
          </li>
<li>
           The amplitude of waves from two sources should be equal.
          </li>
<li>
           The coherent sources must be very close to each other.
          </li>
</ol>

          Question 39.
          <br/>
          Distinguish between unpolarised and a linearly polarised light. Describe, with the help of a diagram, how unpolarised light gets linearly polarised by scattering. (Comptt. Delhi 2016)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Unpolarized light : A light wave, in which the electric vector oscillates in all possible directions in a plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation is known as unpolarized light.
          <br/>
          Linearly polarized light : If the oscillations of the electric vectors are restricted to just one direction, in a plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation, the corresponding light is known as linearly polarized light.
         </p>
<p>
          It is due to scattering of light by molecules of earth’s atmosphere.
          <br/>
<img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 10 Wave Optics Class 12 Important Questions 131" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-116208" height="154" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-10-Wave-Optics-Class-12-Important-Questions-131.png" width="236"/>
<br/>
          Under the influence of the electric field of the incident (unpolarized) wave, the electrons in the molecules acquire components of motion in both these directions. Charges, accelerating parallel to the double arrows, do not radiate energy towards the observer since their acceleration has no transverse component.
          <br/>
          The radiation scattered by the molecules is therefore represented by dots, i.e., it is polarized perpendicular to plane of figure.

          <br/>
          (i) Brewster’s law : When unpolarised light is incident on the surface separating two media, the reflected light gets (completely) polarized only when the reflected light and refracted light become perpendicular to each other.

</p>
<p>
          (ii) Since refractive index (µ) of a transparent medium is different for different colours, hence Brewster angle also is different for different colours.

          (ii) Intensity pattern for double slit interference.

          (iii) Difference between Interference and Difference Patterns:
          <br/>
          Interference pattern and Diffraction pattern :
          <br/>
          The diagram, given here, shows several fringes, due to double slit interference, ‘contained’ in a broad diffraction peak. When the separation between the slits is large compared to their width, the diffraction pattern becomes very flat and we observe the two slit interference pattern.

<br/>
          Basic features of distinction between interference and diffraction patterns :
          <br/>
          (i) The interference pattern has a number of equally spaced bright and dark bands while diffraction pattern has a central bright maximum which is twice as wide as the other maxima.
          <br/>
          (ii) Interference pattern is the superimposition of two waves slits originating from two narrow slits. The diffraction pattern is a superposition of a continuous family of waves originating from each point on a single slit.
          <br/>
          (iii) For a single slit of width ‘a’ the first null of diffraction pattern occurs at an angle of \(\frac{\lambda}{a}\). At the same angle of \(\frac{\lambda}{a}\), we get a maxima for two narrow slits separated by a distance ‘a’.

          (ii) We take a plane wavefront AB incident at a plane surface XY. We use secondary wavelets starting at different times. We get refracted wavefront only when the time taken by light to travel along different rays from one wavefront to another is same. We take any arbitrary ray starting from point ‘P’ on incident wavefront to refracted wavefront at point ‘O’. Let total time be ‘t’.

          We take any point Q on the incident wavefront. When disturbance from point B on the incident wavefront reaches point B’, the disturbance from point Q reaches Q’ via point K on the reflecting surface.

          What is an unpolarized light? Explain with the help of suitable ray diagram how an unpolarized light can be polarized by reflection from a transparent medium. Write the expression for Brewster angle in terms of the refractive index of denser medium. (Delhi 2009)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Unpolarized light: A light which has vibrations in all directions in a plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation is said to be unpolarized light.

          Question 52.
          <br/>
          (a) How does an unpolarised light get polarised when passed through a polaroid?
          <br/>
          (b) Two polaroids are set in crossed positions. A third polaroid is placed between the two making an angle 0 with the pass axis of the first polaroid. Write the expression for the intensity of light transmitted from the second polaroid. In what orientations will the transmitted intensity by

          <br/>
          (ii) maximum? (All India 2009)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) In a polaroid a long chain of molecules is aligned in a particular direction. The electric vectors (of light waves) along the direction of . aligned molecules gets absorbed.
          <br/>
          An unpolarised light wave incident on such a polaroid gets linearly polarised with the electric vector oscillating along a direction perpendicular to the aligned molecules. This direction is called pass-axis of the polaroid.

          Question 55.
          <br/>
          Use Huygen’s principle to verify the laws of refraction. (Delhi 2011)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) Wavefront : Wavefront is defined as the continuous locus of all such particles of the medium which are vibrating in the same phase at any instant.
          <br/>

          (ii) We take a plane wavefront AB incident at a plane surface XY. We use secondary wavelets starting at different times. We get refracted wavefront only when the time taken by light to travel along different rays from one wavefront to another is same. We take any arbitrary ray starting from point ‘P’ on incident wavefront to refracted wavefront at point ‘O’. Let total time be ‘t’.

          Question 56.
          <br/>
          (a) Describe briefly, with the help of suitable diagram, how the transverse nature of light can be demonstrated by the phenomenon of polarization.
          <br/>
          (b) When unpolarized light passes from air to a transparent medium, under what condition does the reflected light get polarized? (Delhi 2011)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Light from a source S is allowed to fall normally on the flat surface of a thin plate of a tourmaline crystal, cut parallel to its axis. Only a part of this light is transmitted through A. If now the plate A is rotated, the character of transmitted light remains unchanged. Now another similar plate B is placed at some distance from A such that the axis of B is parallel to that of A. If the light transmitted through A is passed through B, the light is almost completely transmitted through B and no change is observed in the light coming out of B.

<br/>
          If now the crystal A is kept fixed and B is gradually rotated in its own plane, the intensity of light emerging out of B decreases and becomes zero when the axis of B is perpendicular to that of A. If B is further rotated, the intensity begins to increase and becomes maximum when the axes of A and B are again parallel.
         </p>
<p>
          Thus, we see that the intensity of light transmitted through B is maximum when axes of A and B are parallel and minimum when they are at right angles.
         </p>
<p>
          From this experiment, it is obvious that light waves are transverse and not longitudinal; because, if they were longitudinal, the rotation of crystal B would not produce any change in the intensity of light.
         </p>
<p>
          (b) After falling on a transparent medium, unpolarised light will get polarised after reflection only if refracted and reflected rays make a right angle to each other.

          The last term \(2 \sqrt{I_{1} I_{2}}\) cos ϕ is called interference term.
          <br/>
          There are two possibilities :
          <br/>
          (i) If cos ϕ remains constant with time, the total intensity at any point will be constant. The intensity will be maximum \(\left(\sqrt{I_{1}}+\sqrt{I_{2}}\right)^{2}\) at points when cos ϕ is +1 and minimum \(\left(\sqrt{I_{1}}-\sqrt{I_{2}}\right)^{2}\) at points
          <br/>
          where cos ϕ = -1. The sources in this case are coherent.
          <br/>
          (ii) If cos ϕ varies continuously with time assuming both positive and negative values, then the average value of cos § will be zero over time interval of measurement. Then interference term averages to zero. There will be same intensity, I = I

          + I
          <sub>
           2
          </sub>
          at every point i.e. there will be general illumination on the observation screen. The two sources in two cases are incoherent.
         </p>
<p>
          Hence to observe interference, we need to have two sources with same frequency and with a constant phase difference. Such a pair of sources is called coherent source.

          Question 58.
          <br/>
          Use Huygens’s principle to explain the formation of diffraction pattern due to a single slit
          <br/>
          illuminated by a monochromatic source of light. When the width of the slit is made double the
          <br/>
          original width, how would this affect the size and intensity of the central diffraction band?
          <br/>
          (Delhi 2011)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) According to Huygen’s principle “The net effect at any point due to a number of wavelets is equal to sum total of contribution of all wavelets with proper phase difference.”
         </p>
<p>
          The point O is maxima because contribution from each half of the slit S

<br/>
          When widths of slits are doubled, contrast between maxima and minima decreases due to the overlapping of interference patterns formed by various narrow pairs of the two slits.
         </p>
<p>
          ∴ Size of central maxima will be reduced to half and intensity of central maxima will be four times.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 59.
          <br/>
          (a) Why are coherent sources necessary to produce a sustained interference pattern?
          <br/>
          (b) In Young’s double slit experiment using monochromatic light of wavelength λ, the intensity of light at a point on the screen where path difference is λ, is K units. Find out the intensity of light at a point where path difference is λ/3. (Delhi 2011)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Coherent sources are needed to ensure that the positions of maxima and minima do not change with time. These have a constant phase difference and, therefore produce sustained interference pattern.

          Question 60.
          <br/>
          Explain briefly, giving a suitable diagram, how an unpolarised light incident on the interface separating two transparent media gets polarised on reflection. Deduce the necessary condition for it. (Comptt. Delhi 2011)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Unpolarized light: A light which has vibrations in all directions in a plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation is said to be unpolarized light.
          <br/>

<br/>
          When unpolarised light is incident on the boundary of two transparent media, the reflected light is polarised with electric vector perpendicular to the plane of incidence when the refracted and reflected rays make a right angle with each other.

          Question 61.
          <br/>
          (a) In what way is diffraction from each slit related to the interference pattern in a double slit experiment?
          <br/>
          (b) Two wavelengths of sodium light 590 nm and 596 nm are used, in turn, to study the diffraction taking place at a single slit of aperture 2 × 10
          <sup>
           -4
          </sup>
          m. The distance between the slit and the screen is 1.5 m. Calculate the separation between the positions of the first maxima of the diffraction pattern obtained in the two cases. (Delhi 2011)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) When there are only a few sources, say two interfering sources, then the result is usually called interference, but if there is a large number of them, it seems that the word diffraction is more often used. In the double slit experiment, we must note that the pattern on the screen is actually a superposition of single slit diffraction from each slit and double slit interference pattern. As a result, there appears a broader diffraction peak in which there occur several fringes of smaller widths due to double slit interference.

          Question 63.
          <br/>
          (a) What is linearly polarized light ? Describe briefly using a diagram how sunlight is polarised.
          <br/>
          (b) Unpolarised light is incident on a polaroid. How would the intensity of transmitted light change when the polaroid is rotated? (All India 2011)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Linearly polarised light : Linearly or plane polarised light is that light in which vibrations of electric field vector are taking place only in one particular plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation of light wave. Sun-light is unpolarised light having electric field vector oscillating in all planes, when it passes through a polariser which can be a nicol prism or tourmaline crystal, only those vibrations of light pass through crystal which are parallel to axis of polarizer and hence we get a plane polarised light having vibrations in one plane. Plane polarized light can be observed by using analyzer.

          (b) When the polaroid is rotated, the intensity of the transmitted light changes. When the angle of rotation is 45°, the intensity become I

          /2. When the polaroid is further rotated and at an angle of 90°, the intensity is minimum. Thus the intensity of polarised light changes with the angle of rotation of polaroid. It is shown graphically.

          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Light from a source S is allowed to fall normally on the flat surface of a thin plate of a tourmaline crystal, cut parallel to its axis. Only a part of this light is transmitted through A. If now the plate A is rotated, the character of transmitted light remains unchanged. Now another similar plate B is placed at some distance from A such that the axis of B is parallel to that of A. If the light transmitted through A is passed through B, the light is almost completely transmitted through B and no change is observed in the light coming out of B.

<br/>
          If now the crystal A is kept fixed and B is gradually rotated in its own plane, the intensity of light emerging out of B decreases and becomes zero when the axis of B is perpendicular to that of A. If B is further rotated, the intensity begins to increase and becomes maximum when the axes of A and B are again parallel.
         </p>
<p>
          Thus, we see that the intensity of light transmitted through B is maximum when axes of A and B are parallel and minimum when they are at right angles.
         </p>
<p>
          From this experiment, it is obvious that light waves are transverse and not longitudinal; because, if they were longitudinal, the rotation of crystal B would not produce any change in the intensity of light.

          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Polarisation by scattering. When a beam of white light is passed through a medium, then the beam gets scattered. When the scattered light is seen in a direction perpendicular to the direction of incidence, it is found to be plane polarised. This phenomenon is called polarisation by scattering
          <br/>

<br/>
          A beam of unpolarised light is incident along Z-axis on a particle. When it is taken along X-axis or Y-axis, then only the vibrations which are parallel to Y-axis or
          <br/>
          X-axis, are seen. Hence, light scattered in a direction perpendicular to the incident light is always plane polarised.

          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Polarisation of light by reflection. The simplest method to produce plane polarised light is by reflection.
          <br/>
<img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 10 Wave Optics Class 12 Important Questions 72" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-116141" height="247" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-10-Wave-Optics-Class-12-Important-Questions-72.png" width="252"/>
<br/>
          When unpolarised light is reflected from a surface, the reflected light may be completely polarised, partially polarised or unpolarised depending on the incident angle.
          <br/>
          The angle of incidence at which the reflected light is completely polarised, is called polarising angle. It is represented by i
          <sub>
           β
          </sub>
          .
          <br/>
          The value of i
          <sub>
           β
          </sub>
          depends on the wavelength of light used. Therefore, complete polarisation is possible only for monochromatic light. The reflected light along OB is completely plane polarised. The light refracted along OC is unpolarised.
          <br/>
          Hence, the reflected light is completely plane polarised in the plane of incidence.

          Question 68.
          <br/>
          A parallel beam of monochromatic light falls normally on a narrow slit of width ‘a’ to produce a diffraction pattern on the screen placed parallel to the plane of the slit. Use Huygens’ principle to explain that
          <br/>
          (i) the central bright maxima is twice as wide as the other maxima.
          <br/>
          (ii) the intensity falls as we move to successive maxima away from the centre on either side.
          <br/>
          (Comptt. Delhi 2011)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) In diffraction pattern, intensity will be minimum at an angle θ = nλ/a
          <br/>
          ∴ There will be a first minimum at an angle
          <br/>
          θ = λ/a, on either side of central maximum
          <br/>
          ∴ Width of central maxima = 2λ/a
          <br/>
          ∴ The central bright maxima is twice as wide as the other maxima.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) The intensity of maxima decreases as the order (n) or diffraction maxima increases. This is because, on dividing the slit into odd number of parts, the contributions of the corresponding (outermost) pairs cancel each other, leaving behind the contribution of only the innermost segment.
         </p>
<p>
          For example, for first maximum, dividing slit into three parts out of these three parts of the slit, the contributions from first two parts cancel each other; only 1/3
          <sup>
           rd
          </sup>
          portion of the slit contributes to the maxima of intensity. Similarly for second maxima, dividing slit into five parts, contribution of first four parts will be zero (as they cancel each other). The remaining 1/5
          <sup>
           th
          </sup>
          portion only will contribute for maxima and so on.

          Question 74.
          <br/>
          Explain by drawing a suitable diagram that the interference pattern in a double slit is actually a superposition of single slit diffraction from each slit.
          <br/>
          Write two basic features which distinguish the interference pattern from those seen in a coherently illuminated single slit. (Comptt. Delhi 2015)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Interference pattern and Diffraction pattern :
          <br/>
          The diagram, given here, shows several fringes, due to double slit interference, ‘contained’ in a broad diffraction peak. When the separation between the slits is large compared to their width, the diffraction pattern becomes very flat and we observe the two slit interference pattern.
          <br/>
<img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 10 Wave Optics Class 12 Important Questions 86" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-116156" height="168" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-10-Wave-Optics-Class-12-Important-Questions-86.png" width="275"/>
<br/>
          Basic features of distinction between interference and diffraction patterns :
          <br/>
          (i) The interference pattern has a number of equally spaced bright and dark bands while diffraction pattern has a central bright maximum which is twice as wide as the other maxima.
          <br/>
          (ii) Interference pattern is the superimposition of two waves slits originating from two narrow slits. The diffraction pattern is a superposition of a continuous family of waves originating from each point on a single slit.
          <br/>
          (iii) For a single slit of width ‘a’ the first null of diffraction pattern occurs at an angle of \(\frac{\lambda}{a}\). At the same angle of \(\frac{\lambda}{a}\), we get a maxima for two narrow slits separated by a distance ‘a’.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 75.
          <br/>
          (a) The ratio of the widths of two slits in Young’s double slit experiment is 4 : 1. Evaluate the ratio of intensities at maxima and minima in the interference pattern.
          <br/>
          (b) Does the appearance of bright and dark fringes in the interference pattern violate, in any way, conservation of energy? (Comptt. All India 2015)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
<img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 10 Wave Optics Class 12 Important Questions 87" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-116158" height="250" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-10-Wave-Optics-Class-12-Important-Questions-87.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-10-Wave-Optics-Class-12-Important-Questions-87.png 368w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-10-Wave-Optics-Class-12-Important-Questions-87-300x204.png 300w" width="368"/>
</p>
<p>
          (b) The appearance of bright and dark fringes in the interference pattern does not violate the principle of conservation of energy, because the light energy is distributed. If it reduces in one region, producing a dark fringe, it increases in another region, producing a bright fringe. There is no gain or loss of energy.

          Question 78.
          <br/>
          Define the term wave front. State Huygen’s principle.
          <br/>
          Consider a plane wave front incident on a thin convex lens. Draw a proper diagram to show how the incident wave front traverses through the lens and after refraction focusses on the focal point of the lens, giving the shape of the emergent wave front. (All India 2015)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) Wave front : It is defined as the locus of all points which oscillate in phase.
          <br/>
          (ii) Huygen’s Principle :
          <br/>
          1 Each point of the wave front is the source of a secondary disturbance and the wavelets emanating from these points spread out in all directions. These travel with the same velocity as that of the original wave front.
          <br/>
          2. The shape and position of the wave front, after time Y, is given by the tangential envelope to the secondary wavelets.
          <br/>

<br/>
          Hence write an expression for the total linear width of the central maxima on a screen kept at a distance D from the plane of the slit. (Comptt. Delhi 2015)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) At central point C, angle θ is zero, all path differences are zero. Hence, all the parts of the slit contribute in same phase. This gives maximum intensity at point C.
          <br/>
          (ii) From the diagram :
          <br/>

<br/>
          It implies that the contribution from corresponding points in two halves of the slit have a phase difference of π. Therefore, contributions from two halves cancel each other in pairs, resulting in a zero net intensity at point P on the screen.

          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Interference pattern in Young’s double slit experiment will not be observed, because two independent lamps do not constitute ‘coherent sources’.

          Question 83.
          <br/>
          (a) Explain how the intensity of diffraction pattern changes as the order (n) of the diffraction band varies.
          <br/>
          (b) Two wavelengths of sodium light 590 nm and 596 nm are used in turn to study the diffraction at a single slit of size 4 mm. The distance between the slit and screen is 2 m. Calculate the separation between the positions of the first maximum of the diffraction pattern obtained in the two cases. (Comptt. All India 2015)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Intensity of diffraction pattern drops rapidly with order n, because every higher order
          <br/>
          maxima gets intensity only from \(\left(\frac{1}{2 n+1}\right)\) part of the slit. The central maxima gets intensity from the whole slit (n = 0).

          Question 84.
          <br/>
          Why are coherent sources necessary to produce interference in Young’s double slit experiment? Light waves from two coherent sources have intensities in the ratio of 4 : 9. Find the ratio of intensities of maxima and minima in the interference pattern. (Comptt. Delhi 2015)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          If sources are not coherent, the superposition pattern (intensity pattern) is not stable. It keeps on changing with time and hence it is necessary to have coherent sources to observe interference in Young’s double slit experiment.

          Question 85.
          <br/>
          State the two features to distinguish between interference and diffraction phenomena. Two wavelengths of light 600 nm and 610 nm are used in turn, to study the diffraction at a single slit of size 2 mm. The distance between the slits and screen is 2 m. Calculate the separation between the positions of the second order maximum of the diffraction pattern obtained in the two cases. (Comptt. All India 2015)
          <br/>

          For distinction between interference and diffraction :
          <br/>
          Interference pattern and Diffraction pattern :
          <br/>
          The diagram, given here, shows several fringes, due to double slit interference, ‘contained’ in a broad diffraction peak. When the separation
          <br/>
          between the slits is large compared to their width, the diffraction pattern becomes very flat and we observe the two slit interference pattern.

<br/>
          Basic features of distinction between interference and diffraction patterns :
          <br/>
          (i) The interference pattern has a number of equally spaced bright and dark bands while diffraction pattern has a central bright maximum which is twice as wide as the other maxima.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Interference pattern is the superimposition of two waves slits originating from two narrow slits. The diffraction pattern is a superposition of a continuous family of waves originating from each point on a single slit.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) For a single slit of width ‘a’ the first null of diffraction pattern occurs at an angle of \(\frac{\lambda}{a}\). At the same angle of \(\frac{\lambda}{a}\), we get a maxima for two narrow slits separated by a distance ‘a’.

          Question 86.
          <br/>
          (a) What is plane polarised light? Two polaroids are placed at 90° to each other and the transmitted intensity is zero. What happens when one more polaroid is placed between these two, bisecting the angle between them? How will the intensity of transmitted light vary on further rotating the third polaroid?
          <br/>
          (b) If a light beam shows no intensity variation when transmitted through a polaroid which is rotated, does it mean that the light is unpolarised? Explain briefly. (Delhi 2015)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Plane polarised light is the light wave in which optical vector (electric vector) oscillates only in a single plane in a direction perpendicular to the direction of propagation of wave.
          <br/>
          Obviously, the axis of P
          <sub>
           3

          is inclined at 45° to the axis of P

          and P
          <sub>
           2
          </sub>
          .
          <br/>
          Let the maximum intensity transmitted by polarised,
          <br/>
<img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 10 Wave Optics Class 12 Important Questions 102" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-116178" height="176" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 321px) 100vw, 321px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-10-Wave-Optics-Class-12-Important-Questions-102.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-10-Wave-Optics-Class-12-Important-Questions-102.png 321w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-10-Wave-Optics-Class-12-Important-Questions-102-300x164.png 300w" width="321"/>
<br/>
          Thus the final intensity becomes one-fourth of the maximum intensity transmitted by the first polariod. On further rotating the third polaroid, the intensity of transmitted light decreases till it becomes zero.
         </p>
<p>
          (b) Yes, the light beam is unpolarised. The polaroid cuts down the intensity to half due to polarisation of light. When polaroid is rotated, only the plane of polarisation rotates but the intensity of light does not show any change.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 87.
          <br/>
          (a) What are coherent sources of light? Two slits in Young’s double slit experiment are illuminated by two different sodium lamps emitting light of the same wavelength. Why is no interference pattern observed?
          <br/>
          (b) Obtain the condition for getting dark and bright fringes in Young’s experiment. Hence write the expression for the fringe width.
          <br/>
          (c) If s is the size of the source and its distance is a from the plane of the two slits, what should be the criterion for the interference fringes to be seen? (All India 2015)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Two sources of light having same frequency and a constant or a zero phase difference are said to be coherent.
          <br/>
          Light wave emitted from an ordinary source (like a sodium lamp) undergoes abrupt phase changes in times of the order of 10
          <sup>
           -10
          </sup>
          seconds. Thus two independent sources of light will not have a fixed phase relationship and would be incoherent.

          Huygen’s principle :
          <br/>
          “(i) Each point on a wavefront acts as a fresh source of new disturbance called secondary waves or wavelets;
          <br/>
          (ii) The secondary wavelets spread out in all directions with the speed of wave in the given medium;
          <br/>
          (iii) The new wavefront at any later time is given by the forward envelope (tangential surface in the forward direction) of the secondary wavelets at that time.
          <br/>

<br/>
          The reason is that the intensity of the central maxima is due to the constructive interference of wavelets from all parts of the slit, the first secondary maxima is due to the contribution of wavelets from one third part of the slit (wavelets from remaining two parts interfere destructively), the second secondary maxima is due to the contribution of wavelets from the one fifth part only (the remaining four parts interfere destructively) and so on. Hence, the intensity’ of secondary maxima decreases with the increase in the order n of the maxima.

          Question 89.
          <br/>
          Explain briefly how the phenomenon of total internal reflection is used in fibre optics. (Delhi 2011)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Each optical fibre consists of a core and cladding. Refractive index of the material of the core is higher than that of cladding. When a video signal is directed into an optical fibre at a suitable angle, it undergoes internal reflections repeatedly along the length of the optical fibre and comes out of it with almost neglible loss of intensity.

          Question 90.
          <br/>
          (i) State the importance of coherent sources in the phenomenon of interference.
          <br/>
          (ii) In Young’s double slit experiment to produce interference pattern, obtain the conditions for constructive and destructive interference. Hence deduce the expression for the fringe width.
          <br/>
          (iii) How does the fringe width get affected, if the entire experimental apparatus of Young is immersed in water? (All India 2010)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) Importance of coherent source : Coherent sources are necessary to produce sustained interference pattern. Otherwise the phase difference between the two interfering waves will change rapidly and the interference pattern will be lost. .
          <br/>
          (ii)
          <br/>
          (a) For constructive interference : We will have constructive interference resulting in a bright fringe when path difference is equal to nλ.

          Question 93.
          <br/>
          (a) How does an unpolarized light incident on a polaroid get polarized?
          <br/>
          Describe briefly, with the help of a necessary diagram, the polarization of light by reflection from a transparent medium.
          <br/>
          (b) Two polaroids ‘A’ and ‘B’ are kept in crossed position. How should a third polaroid ‘C’ be placed between them so that the intensity of polarized light transmitted by polaroid B reduces to 1/8* of the intensity of unpolarized ‘ light incident on A? (All India 2010)

<br/>
          When unpolarised light is reflected from a surface, the reflected light may be completely polarised, partially polarised or unpolarised depending on the incident angle.
          <br/>
          The angle of incidence at which the reflected light is completely polarised, is called polarising angle. It is represented by i
          <sub>
           β
          </sub>
          .
          <br/>
          The value of i
          <sub>
           β
          </sub>
          depends on the wavelength of light used. Therefore, complete polarisation is possible only for monochromatic light. The reflected light along OB is completely plane polarised. The light refracted along OC is unpolarised.
          <br/>
          Hence, the reflected light is completely plane polarised in the plane of incidence.(b) Let the intensity of unpolarized light = I

          <br/>
          (i) Is the frequency of reflected and refracted light same as the frequency of incident light?
          <br/>
          (ii) Does the decrease in speed imply a reduction in the energy carried by light wave? (Delhi 2010)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Huygen’s principle ; Huygen’s principle is based on two assumptions :
          <br/>
          (i) Each point on the primary wavefront is a source of a new disturbance called secondary wavelets which travel in all directions with same velocity as that of original waves.
          <br/>
          (ii) A surface tangential to the secondary . wavelets gives the position and shape of new wavefront at any instant. This is called secondary wavefront.
         </p>
<p>
          The principle leads to the well known laws of reflection and refraction.

<br/>
          (b) (i) Yes, frequency is the property of source. Hence, frequency does not change when light is reflected or refracted.
          <br/>
          (ii) No, decrease in speed does not imply reduction in energy carried by light wave.
         </p>
<p>
          This is because the frequency does not change and according to the formula E = hv, energy will be independent of speed. Energy carried by a wave depends on the amplitude of the wave, not on the speed of wave propagation.

<br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) A polaroid consists of long chain molecules aligned in a particular direction. The electric vectors (associated with the propagating light wave) along the direction of the aligned molecules get absorbed. Thus, if an unpolarised light wave is incident on such a polaroid then the light wave will get linearly polarised with the electric vector oscillating along a direction perpendicular to the aligned molecules.

          <br/>
          (b) A beam of unpolarised light is incident on a glass-air interface. Show, using a suitable ray diagram, that light reflected from the interface is totally polarised, when μ = tan i

          is the Brewster’s angle. (Delhi 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Polarisation of light. Ordinary light is unpolarised light having vibrations distributed in all directions in a plane perpendicular to direction of propagation of light.
          <br/>
          Therefore, the phenomenon of restricting the vibrations of light in a particular direction is called polarisation of light. The tourmaline crystal acts as a polariser.

<br/>
          When unpolarised light (ordinary light) is passed through a tourmaline crystal, only those vibrations of light pass through the crystal which are parallel to crystallographic axis AB. All other vibrations are obstructed. The entering light from the crystal is said to be plane polarised light.
         </p>
<p>

           β
          </sub>
          depends on the wavelength of light used. Therefore, complete polarisation is possible only for monochromatic light. The reflected light along OB is completely plane polarised. The light refracted along OC is unpolarised.
          <br/>
          Hence, the reflected light is completely plane polarised in the plane of incidence. Brewster’s law. It states that “when light is incident at polarising angle, the reflected and refracted rays are perpendicular to each other”. When light is incident at polarising angle, the reflected component along OB and refracted components along OC are mutually perpendicular.

          Question 100.
          <br/>
          (a) Describe briefly how a diffraction pattern is obtained on a screen due to a single narrow slit illuminated by a monochromatic source of light. Hence obtain the conditions for the angular width of secondary maxima and secondary minima.
          <br/>
          (b) Two wavelengths of sodium light of 590 nm and 596 nm are used in turn to study the diffraction taking place at a single slit of aperture 2 × 10
          <sup>
           -6
          </sup>
          m. The distance between the slit and the screen is 1.5 m. Calculate the separation between the positions of first maxima of the diffraction pattern obtained in the two cases. (All India 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Diffraction at a single slit. Suppose a parallel beam of monochromatic light of wavelength X falls normally on a slit AB of width d (of the order of the wavelength of light). The diffraction occurs on passing through the slit. The diffraction pattern is focussed on to the screen by a convex lens. The diffraction pattern consists of a central bright fringe (or band), having alternate dark and bright fringes of decreasing intensity on both sides.
          <br/>
          1. Position of central maximum. Let C be the centre of the slit AB. According to Huygen’s principle, “when.light falls on the slit, it becomes a source of secondary wavelets.” All the wavelets originating from slit AB are in same phase. These secondary waves reinforce each other resulting the central maximum intensity at O.
          <br/>

<br/>
          2. Position of secondary maxima and minima. Consider a point P on the screen. All the secondary waves travelling in a direction making angle θ with CO, reach at a point P. The intensity at P depends on the path difference between secondary waves.
          <br/>
          ∴ Path difference between the secondary waves reaching P from points A and B is, BN = d sin θ

          <br/>
          (a) Unpolarized light : A light wave, in which the electric vector oscillates in all possible directions in a plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation is known as unpolarized light.
          <br/>
          Linearly polarized light : If the oscillations of the electric vectors are restricted to just one direction, in a plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation, the corresponding light is known as linearly polarized light.

<br/>
          Under the influence of the electric field of the incident (unpolarized) wave, the electrons in the molecules acquire components of motion in both these directions. Charges, accelerating parallel to the double arrows, do not radiate energy towards the observer since their acceleration has no transverse component.
          <br/>
          The radiation scattered by the molecules is therefore represented by dots, i.e., it is polarized perpendicular to plane of figure.

          Question 102.
          <br/>
          (a) Using Huygen’s construction of secondary wavelets explain how a diffraction pattern is obtained on a screen due to a narrow slit on which a monochromatic beam of light is incident normally.
          <br/>
          (b) Show that the angular width of the first diffraction fringe is half that of the central fringe.
          <br/>
          (c) Explain why the maxima at \(\theta=\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right) \frac{\lambda}{a}\) become weaker and weaker with increasing n. (Delhi 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Diffraction Pattern : We can regard the total contribution of the wavefront LN at some point P on the screen, as the resultant effect of the superposition of its wavelets like LM, MM
          <sub>
           2
          </sub>
          , M
          <sub>
           2
          </sub>
          N. These have to be superposed taking into account their proper phase differences. We, therefore, get maxima and minima, i.e. a diffraction pattern, on the screen.
          <br/>
<img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 10 Wave Optics Class 12 Important Questions 132" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-116209" height="559" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-10-Wave-Optics-Class-12-Important-Questions-132.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-10-Wave-Optics-Class-12-Important-Questions-132.png 389w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-10-Wave-Optics-Class-12-Important-Questions-132-209x300.png 209w" width="389"/>
<br/>
          Hence angular width of first fringe is half of the angular width of central fringe.
          <br/>
          (c) Maxima become weaker and weaker with increasing n. This is because the effective part of the wavefront, contributing to the maxima, becomes smaller and smaller, with increasing n.

<br/>
          Hence establish the conditions for constructive and destructive interference,
          <br/>
          (b) What is the effect on the interference fringes in Young’s double slit experiment when
          <br/>
          (i) the width of the source slit is increased;
          <br/>
          (ii) the monochromatic source is replaced by a source of white light? (All India 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
<img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 10 Wave Optics Class 12 Important Questions 138" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-116217" height="436" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-10-Wave-Optics-Class-12-Important-Questions-138.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-10-Wave-Optics-Class-12-Important-Questions-138.png 368w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-10-Wave-Optics-Class-12-Important-Questions-138-253x300.png 253w" width="368"/>
<br/>
          (b) (i) When width of the source slit is increased, then the angular fringe width remains unchanged, but fringes become less and less sharp, so visibility of fringes decreases. If the condition, \(\frac{s}{S}&lt;\frac{\lambda}{d}\) is not satisfied, the interference pattern disappears.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) When the monochromatic source is replaced by a source of white light, the interference pattern due to different component colours of white light overlap (incoherently). The central bright fringes for different colours are at the same position. Therefore, the central fringe is
          <br/>

<br/>
          Thus, the fringe closest on either side of the central white fringe is red and the farthest will appear blue. After a few fringes, no clear fringe pattern is seen.

          (ii) Light emerging out of a convex lens when a point source is placed at its focus.
          <br/>
          (iii) Using Huygen’s construction of secondary wavelets, draw a diagram showing the passage of a plane wavefront from a denser into a rarer medium. (Comptt. All India 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Wavefront is the locus of all points, which oscillate in phase or it is the surface of constant phase.
          <br/>
          A ray is defined as the path of energy propagation in the limit of wavelength tending to zero.

          (i) Fringe width is directly proportional to the wavelength of light i.e. p X.
          <br/>
          (ii) Fringe width is inversely proportional to the distance between two sources

          <br/>
          The diagram, given here, shows several fringes, due to double slit interference, ‘contained’ in a broad diffraction peak. When the separation between the slits is large compared to their width, the diffraction pattern becomes very flat and we observe the two slit interference pattern.

<br/>
          Basic features of distinction between interference and diffraction patterns :
          <br/>
          (i) The interference pattern has a number of equally spaced bright and dark bands while diffraction pattern has a central bright maximum which is twice as wide as the other maxima.
          <br/>
          (ii) Interference pattern is the superimposition of two waves slits originating from two narrow slits. The diffraction pattern is a superposition of a continuous family of waves originating from each point on a single slit.
          <br/>
          (iii) For a single slit of width ‘a’ the first null of diffraction pattern occurs at an angle of \(\frac{\lambda}{a}\). At the same angle of \(\frac{\lambda}{a}\), we get a maxima for two narrow slits separated by a distance ‘a’.

          reach point O on the screen after travelling equal distances. So path difference and hence phase difference between these waves is zero. Therefore, they meet at O in phase and hence constructive interference

          . (Delhi 2016)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Distinction between unpolarised and polarised light: In an unpolarised light, the oscillations of the electric field, are in random directions, in planes perpendicular to the direction of propagation. For a polarised light, the oscillations are aligned along one particular direction.
         </p>
<p>
          Alternatively, Polarised light can be distinguished, from unpolarised light, when it is allowed to pass through a polaroid. Polarised light can show change in its intensity, on passing through a polaroid:
          <br/>
          while intensity of transmitted light will remain unchanged in case of unpolarised light.
         </p>
<p>
          Polarised light with the help of a polaroid : When unpolarised light wave is incident on a polaroid, the electric vectors along the, direction of its aligned molecules get absorbed; the electric vector, oscillating along a direction perpendicular to the aligned molecules, pass through. This light is called linearly polarised light.

          Question 111.
          <br/>
          (a) Explain two features to distinguish between the interference pattern in Young’s double slit experiment with the diffraction pattern obtained due to a single slit.
          <br/>
          (b) A monochromatic light of wavelength 500 nm is incident normally on a single slit of width 0.2 mm to produce a diffraction pattern. Find the angular width of the central maximum obtained on the screen.
          <br/>
          Estimate the number of fringes obtained in Young’s double slit experiment with fringe width 0.5 mm, which can be accommodated within the region of total angular spread of the central maximum due to single slit. (Delhi. 2016)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Interference pattern and Diffraction pattern :
          <br/>
          The diagram, given here, shows several fringes, due to double slit interference, ‘contained’ in a broad diffraction peak. When the separation between the slits is large compared to their width, the diffraction pattern becomes very flat and we observe the two slit interference pattern.

<img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 10 Wave Optics Class 12 Important Questions 86" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-116156" height="168" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-10-Wave-Optics-Class-12-Important-Questions-86.png" width="275"/>
<br/>
          Basic features of distinction between interference and diffraction patterns :
          <br/>
          (i) The interference pattern has a number of equally spaced bright and dark bands while diffraction pattern has a central bright maximum which is twice as wide as the other maxima.
          <br/>
          (ii) Interference pattern is the superimposition of two waves slits originating from two narrow slits. The diffraction pattern is a superposition of a continuous family of waves originating from each point on a single slit.
          <br/>
          (iii) For a single slit of width ‘a’ the first null of diffraction pattern occurs at an angle of \(\frac{\lambda}{a}\). At the same angle of \(\frac{\lambda}{a}\), we get a maxima for two narrow slits separated by a distance ‘a’.

          Question 113.
          <br/>
          Explain with diagram, how plane polarized light can be produced by scattering of sunlight. An incident beam of light of intensity IG is made to fall on a polaroid A. Another polaroid B is so oriented with respect to A that there is no light emerging out of B. A third polaroid C is now introduced mid-way between A and B and is so oriented that its axis bisects the angle between the axes of A and B. Calculate the intensity of light transmitted by A, B and C. (Comptt. Delhi 2016)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) (c) It is due to scattering of light by molecules of earth’s atmosphere.

<img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 10 Wave Optics Class 12 Important Questions 131" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-116208" height="154" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-10-Wave-Optics-Class-12-Important-Questions-131.png" width="236"/>
<br/>
          Under the influence of the electric field of the incident (unpolarized) wave, the electrons in the molecules acquire components of motion in both these directions. Charges, accelerating parallel to the double arrows, do not radiate energy towards the observer since their acceleration has no transverse component.
          <br/>
          The radiation scattered by the molecules is therefore represented by dots, i.e., it is polarized perpendicular to plane of figure.

          Question 114.
          <br/>
          (a) In Young’s double slit experiment a monochromatic source of light S is kept equidistant from the slits S2 and S2. Explain the formation of dark and bright fringes on the screen.
          <br/>
          (b) A beam of light consisting of two wavelengths, 650 nm and 520 nm, is used to obtain interference fringes in Young’s double-slit experiment.
          <br/>
          (i) Find the distance of the third bright fringe on the screen from the central maximum for wavelength 650 nm?
          <br/>
          (ii) What is the least distance from the central maximum where the bright fringes due to both the wavelengths coincide?
          <br/>
          Given : the separation between the slits is 4 mm and the distance between the screen and plane of the slits is 1.2 m. (Comptt. Delhi 2016)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>

          Thus, bright and dark bands appear on the screen. Such bands are called ‘fringes’.
          <br/>
          These dark and bright fringes are equally spaced.
