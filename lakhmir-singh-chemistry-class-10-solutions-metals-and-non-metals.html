</span>
<br/>
          (a) When non-metals react with oxygen, they form acidic oxides or neutral oxides.
          <br/>
          Example: Carbon reacts with oxygen to form an acidic oxide called carbon dioxide. Hydrogen reacts with oxygen

          (b) Name two metals which can, however, liberate hydrogen gas from very dilute nitric acid.
          <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
            Solution :
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
          Metals do not liberate hydrogen gas with nitric acid because nitric acid is a strong oxidizing agent. So, as soon as hydrogen gas is formed in the reaction between a metal and dilute nitric acid, the nitric acid oxidises
          <br/>
          this hydrogen to water.

<strong>
            Solution :
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
          (a) Most of the metals do not react with hydrogen. Only a few reactive metals react with hydrogen to form metal hydrides. For example: When hydrogen gas is passed over heated sodium, then sodium hydride is formed.

            Question 55:
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
          You are given samples of three metals — sodium, magnesium and copper. Suggest any two activities to arrange them in order of their decreasing reactivities.
          <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
            Solution :
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
          (i) When sodium, magnesium and copper are left in air, sodium reacts vigorously with oxygen to form sodium oxide, magnesium reacts with oxygen to form magnesium oxide only on heating , whereas copper does not burn in air even on strong heating. It reacts only on prolonged heating. This shows that sodium is most reactive, then magnesium and copper is the least reactive among the three.
          <br/>
          (ii) Sodium reacts vigorously with cold water to form sodium hydroxide and hydrogen, magnesium does not react with cold water but reacts with hot water to form magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen but copper does not react even with steam. This shows that sodium is highly reactive; magnesium is less reactive than sodium and copper is the least reactive among the three.

</span>
<br/>
          You are given a dry cell, a torch bulb with holder, wires and crocodile clips. How would you use them to distinguish between samples of metals and non-metals ?
          <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
            Solution :
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
          We would create an apparatus using dry cell, a torch bulb fitted in a holder and some connecting wires with crocodile clips and connect them to make an electric circuit. Then insert a piece of sulphur between the crocodile clips and the bulb does not light up at all. This means that sulphur does not allow the electric current to pass through it. Now insert a piece of copper between the crocodile clips and the bulb will light up. This observation shows that non metals (ex- sulphur) do not conduct electricity and metals (ex- copper) conduct electricity.

<strong>
<br/>
</strong>
</span>
          Metals are said to be shiny. Why do metals generally appear to be dull ? How can their brightness be restored ?
          <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
            Solution :
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
          Metals lose their shine or brightness on keeping in air for a long time and acquire a dull appearence due to the formation of a thin layer of oxide, carbonate or sulphide on their surface by the slow action of various gases present in air.
          <br/>
          Brightness of metals can be restored by rubbing the dull surface of the metal object with a sand paper, then the outer corroded layer is removed and the metal object becomes shiny and bright once again.

          <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
            Solution :
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
          (a)Non-metals are the elements that do not conduct heat and electricity and are neither malleable nor ductile.
          <br/>
          Example: Carbon, sulphur, phosphorus, silicon and oxygen.

          (c) Iodine.
          <br/>
          (d) Carbon (Diamond).
          <br/>
          (e) Non-metals react with oxygen to form acidic oxides or neutral oxides. Carbon burns in air to form carbon dioxide.

<br/>
          The nature of the product formed is acidic. When carbon dioxide dissolves in water, it forms carbonic acid. It turns blue litmus to red which shows it is acidic in nature.

<strong>
            Solution :
           </strong>

</span>
          A zinc plate was kept in a glass container having CuS0

          On examining it was found that the blue colour of the solution is getting lighter and lighter. After a few days, when the zinc plate was taken out of the solution, a number of small holes were noticed in it. State the reason and give chemical equation of the reaction involved.
          <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
            Solution :
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
          Zinc metal is more reactive than copper. Some of the zinc metal of zinc plate dissolves and displaces copper from copper sulphate solution. This dissolving of zinc metal forms tiny holes in zinc plate. Blue colour of copper sulphate solution gets lighter and lighter due to the formation of colourless zinc sulphate solution.

          <br/>
          (b) Explain the formation of a chlorine molecule on the basis of electronic theory of valency.
          <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
            Solution :
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
          (a) Covalent bond ; Because whenever two atoms of the same element combine to form a molecule, a covalent bond is formed.
          <br/>
          (b) The atomic number of chlorine is 17, so its electronic configuration is 2,8,7. Chlorine atom has 7 electrons in its outermost shell and needs 1 more electron to complete its octet and become stable.
          <br/>
          It gets this electron by sharing with another chlorine atom. So, two chlorine atoms share one electron each to form a chlorine molecule. Because the two chlorine atoms share electrons, there is a strong force of attraction between them which holds them together. This force is called covalent bond.
          <br/>
          Now, each chlorine atom in the chlorine molecule has the electronic configuration 2,8,8 resembling its nearest inert gas argon. Since the chlorine atoms in a chlorine molecule have inert gas electron arrangements, therefore, a chlorine molecule is more stable than two separate chlorine atoms.

          Explain why :
          <br/>
          (a) covalent compounds have generally low melting points.
          <br/>
          (b) ionic compounds have generally high melting points.
          <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
            Solution :
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
          (a) Covalent compounds have generally low melting points because they are made up of electrically neutral molecules. So, the force of attraction between the molecules of a covalent compound is ve ry weak. Hence, only a small amount of heat energy is required to break these weak molecular forces.
          <br/>
          (b) Ionic compounds are made of up of positive and negative ions. There is a strong force of attraction between the oppositely charged ions, so a lot of heat energy is required to break this force of attraction and melt or boil the ionic compound. Due to this, ionic compounds have high melting points.

            Question 35:
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
          Describe how sodium and chlorine atoms are changed into ions when they react with each other to form sodium chloride, NaCl. What is the name given to this type of bonding ? (At. No of sodium = 11; At. No. of chlorine = 17)
          <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
            Solution :
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
          The atomic number of sodium is 11, so its electronic configuration is 2,8,1. Sodium atom has only 1 electron in its outermost shell. So, the sodium atom donates one electron (to a chlorine atom) and forms a sodium ion, Na + . The atomic number of chlorine is 17, so its electronic configuration is 2,8,7. Chlorine atom has 7 electrons in its outermost shell and needs 1 more electron to achieve the stable 8-electron inert gas configuration. So, a chlorine atom takes one electron (from the sodium atom) and forms a negatively charged chloride ion, Cl- This type of bonding is called ionic bonding.

<strong>
            Question 36:
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
          What is the difference between a cation and an anion ? How are they formed ? Give the names and symbols of one cation and one anion.
          <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
            Solution :
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
          A positively charged ion is known as cation. A cation is formed by the loss of one or more electrons by an atom. For example: sodium loses 1 electron to form a sodium ion, Na + , which is a cation.
          <br/>
          A negatively charged ion is known as anion. An anion is formed by the gain of one or more electrons by an atom. For example: A chlorine atom gains (accepts) 1 electron to form a chloride ion, Cl – , which is an anion.

          <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
            Solution :
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
          Since nitrogen has 5 electrons in its outermost shell so, to achieve the 8-electron structure of an inert gas, it needs 3 more electrons and hence combines with another nitrogen atom to form a molecule of nitrogen gas.

<strong>
            Solution :

            Question 41:

<br/>
          Explain why, a salt which does not conduct electricity in the solid state becomes a good conductor in molten state.
          <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
            Solution :
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
          Although solid ionic compounds are made up of ions but they do not conduct electricity in solid state. This is because in the solid ionic compound, the ions are held together in fixed positions by strong electrostatic forces and cannot move freely. However, when we dissolve the ionic solid in water or melt it, the crystal structure is broken down and ions become free to move and conduct electricity. Thus, an aqueous solution of an ionic compound conducts electricity because there are plenty of free ions in the solution which are able to conduct electric current.

<br/>
          (d) Sodium chloride has a high melting point because it is an ionic compound and these compounds are made of up of positive and negative ions.

</span>
<br/>
          Explain why, carbon cannot reduce oxides of sodium or magnesium.
          <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
            Solution :
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
          Carbon cannot reduce oxides of sodium or magnesium because carbon is less reactive than magnesium or sodium. Carbon, which is a non-metal, is more reactive than zinc and can be placed just above Zn in the reactivity series. Hence, carbon can reduce the oxides of zinc and all other metals below zinc to form metals.

          <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
            Solution :
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
          The reduction of a metal oxide to form metal by using aluminium powder as a reducing agent is called a thermite reaction.
          <br/>
          This property of reduction by aluminium is made use of in thermite welding for joining the broken pieces of heavy iron objects like girders etc.
          <br/>
          A mixture of Iron (III) oxide and aluminium powder is ignited with a burning magnesium ribbon. Aluminium reduces iron oxide to produce iron metal with the evolution of a lot of heat. Due to this heat, iron metal is produced in the molten state. This molten iron is then poured between the broken iron pieces to weld them (to join them).

</span>
<br/>
          How does the method used for extracting a metal from its ore depend on the metal’s position in the reactivity series ? Explain with examples.
          <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
            Solution :
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
          Different methods are used for extracting metals belonging to category of highly reactive metals, moderately reactive metals and less reactive metals. This is because the extraction of a metal from its concentrated ore is essentially a process of reduction of the metal compound present in the ore. For example: Manganese metal is obtained by the reduction of its oxide with aluminium powder and not carbon. This is because carbon is less reactive than manganese. Carbon, which is a non-metal, is more reactive than zinc and it can be placed just above Zn in the reactivity series. Hence, carbon can reduce the oxides of zinc and all other metals below zinc to form metals

<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
            Solution :
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
          The highly reactive metals are extracted by the electrolytic reduction of their molten chlorides or oxides.
          <br/>
          Example: Sodium metal is extracted by the electrolytic reduction of molten sodium chloride. When electric current is passed through molten sodium chloride, it decomposes to form sodium metal and chlorine gas.

</span>
<br/>
          Describe with one example, how moderately reactive metals (which are in the middle of reactivity series) are extracted.
          <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
            Solution :
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
          The moderately reactive metals are extracted by the reduction of their oxides with carbon, aluminium, sodium or calcium.
          <br/>
          Example: When zinc sulphide (zinc blende ore) is strongly heated in air (roasted), it forms zinc oxide and sulphur dioxide. This process is called roasting. Then, zinc oxide is heated with carbon to form zinc metal. This process is termed as reduction.

<br/>
          The process of purifying impure metals is called refining of metals.
          <br/>
          Electrolytic refining is the most widely used method for the refining of impure metals obtained by various reduction processes.
          <br/>
          In an electrolytic tank, acidified copper sulphate (CuSO 4 + dil ute H 2 O 4 ) solution forms the electrolyte. A block of impure copper is made into an anode by connecting the positive terminal of a power supply (battery). A thin strip of highly pure copper metal is the cathode of the cell. The negative terminal of the power supply is connected to it.
          <br/>

<br/>
          A small electric curr ent is passed through the cell. Atoms from the anode enter the electrolyte. The copper from the anode gets converted into copper sulphide. An equal number of copper atoms from the solution get deposited on the cathode. This is to keep the concentration of the solution constant. Impurities from the anode block either remain in solution or collect below the anode, as they are unable to displace copper from the sulphate solution. The insoluble impurities remain in the electrolyte and are called anode mud.
          <br/>
          Copper sulphate solution contains ions of Cu ++ and SO 4 — . The following reactions take place at the anode and cathode when an electric current is passed.
          <br/>

<br/>
          Pure copper is scraped or removed from the cathode. Anode becomes thinner as the electrolysis process proceeds. Some important metals like gold and silver are present in the anode mud. These can be recovered separately.

</span>
<br/>
          (a) The eating up of metals by the action of air, moisture or a chemical (such as an acid) on their surface is called corrosion.

          <br/>
          (c) Rusting
          <br/>
          (d) Aluminium begins to corrode quickly when it comes in contact with moist air. The action of moist air on aluminium metal forms a thin layer of aluminium oxide all over the metal. This aluminium oxide is very tough and prevents the metal underneath from further corrosion. Therefore, aluminium is used for making utensils irrespective of its highly reactive property as its corrosion leads to the non-corrosion of the metal in the longer run.

<br/>
          What is meant by ‘rusting of iron’ ? With the help of labelled diagrams, describe an activity to find out the conditions under which iron rusts.

<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
            Solution :
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
          When an iron object is left in damp air (or water) for a considerable time, it gets covered with a red-brown flaky substance called rust. This is called rusting of iron .
          <br/>
          Experiment to show that rusting of Iron requires both, air and water :
          <br/>
          We take three test-tubes and put one clean iron nail in each of the three test-tubes:
          <br/>
<img alt="Metals-And-Non-Metalas-Lakhmir-Singh-class-10-Chemistry-Solutions-B-47" height="244" loading="lazy" src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8708/16267023154_171aeff93b_o.png" width="441"/>
<br/>
          1. In the first test-tube containing iron nail, we put some anhydrous calcium chloride and close its mouth with a tight cork . Anhydrous calcium chloride absorbs water moisture from the damp air present in the test-tube and make it dry. In this way, the iron nail in the first test-tube is kept in dry air (having no water vapour in it).
          <br/>
          2. In the second test-tube containing iron nail , we put boiled distilled water. Boiled water does not contain any dissolved air (or oxygen) in it (this is because the process of boiling removes all the dissolved air from it). A layer of oil is put over boiled water in the test-tub e to prevent the outside air from mixing with boiled water. In this way, the iron nail in the second test-tube is kept in air free boiled water.
          <br/>
          3. In the third test-tube containing an iron nail, we put unboiled wa ter so that about two-thirds of nail is immersed in water and the rest is a bove the water, exposed to damp air. In this way , the iron nail in the third test-tube has been placed in air and water together.
          <br/>
          The mouth of all three test tube s is cl osed with a cork and it is kept aside for about one week.
          <br/>
          After one week, we observe the iron nails kept in all the three test-tubes, one by one. We find tha t (i) No rust is seen on the surface of iron nai l kept in dry air (water-f ree air) in the first test-tube. This tells us that rusting of iron does not take place in air alone.
          <br/>
          (ii) No rust is seen on the surface of iron nail kept in air-free, boiled water in the second test-tube. This tells us that rusting of iron does not take place in water alone.
          <br/>
          (iii) Red-brown rust is seen on the surface of iron nail kept in the presence of both air and wat er together the third test-tube. This tells us that rusting of iron takes pla ce in the presence of both air and water together.

            Solution :

<br/>
          For the refining of an impure metal by the process of electrolysis, a thick block of impure metal is made anode (connected to +ve terminal of the battery) and a thin strip of the pure metal is made cathode (connected to -ve terminal of battery). A water soluble salt (of the metal to be refined) is taken as electrolyte. On passing current, impure metal dissolves from the anode and goes into the electrolyte solution. And pure metal from the electrolyte deposits on the cathode.
          <br/>
          Electrolytic refining of copper: In an electrolytic tank, acidified copper sulphate (CuSO 4 + dil ute H 2 O 4 ) solution forms the electrolyte. A block of impure copper is made into an anode by connecting the positive terminal of a power supply (battery). A thin strip of highly pure copper metal is the cathode of the cell.

           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
          Metal P is zinc; Metal Q is tin; Metal R is lead; Metal S is iron.
          <br/>
          Metal P (zinc) is used to form a thin layer on metal S (iron) by the process of galvanisation to prevent its corrosion.
          <br/>
          Metal Q (tin) i s used for electroplating tiffin boxes made of metal S (iron).
          <br/>
          Metal R (lead) is used in making car batteries.
          <br/>
          Metals Q (tin) and R (lead) form an alloy called solder .

            Question 100:
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
          Metals X and Y can be recovered from the anode mud left behind after the electrolytic refining of copper metal. The coins made of metal X look new even after several years of use but the coins made of metal Y lose their shine gradually and get blackened soon. When metal X is alloyed with a small amount of metal Y, it becomes hard and hence suitable for making ornaments. What are metals X and Y ? Also state the colour of metal X.
          <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
            Solution :
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
          Metal X is gold and Metal Y is silver; The colour of metal X (gold) is yellow.
