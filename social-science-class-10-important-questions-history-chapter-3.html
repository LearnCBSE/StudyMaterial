          Question 14.
          <br/>
          Explain the idea of Satyagraha according to Gandhiji. (2014 D)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Mahatma Gandhi returned to India in 1915 from South Africa. Gandhiji’s novel method of mass agitation is know as ‘Satyagraha’. Satyagraha emphasised truth. Gandhiji believed that if the cause is true, if the struggle is against injustice, then physical force was not necessary to fight the oppressor. A satyagrahi can win the battle through non-violence. People, including oppressors, had to be persuaded to see the truth. Truth was bound to ultimately triumph. Gandhiji believed that dharma of non-violence could unite all India.

          Question 15.
          <br/>
          Explain the effects of ‘worldwide economic depression’ on India, towards late 1920s. (2013 OD)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          In 19th century, colonial India had become an exporter of agricultural goods and an importer of manufactures.
          <br/>
          The worldwide economic depression immediately affected Indian trade. India’s exports and imports nearly halved between 1928 and 1934. As international prices crashed, prices in India also plunged. Peasants producing for the world market were worst hit. Though agricultural prices fell, the colonial government refused to reduce revenue demands. Peasants indebtedness increased. For example, Jute producers of Bengal.
         </p>
<p>
          In these depression years, India became an exporter of precious metals, notably gold.

          Question 16.
          <br/>
          Explain any three facts about the new economic situation created in India by the First World War. (2011 D)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The First World War created a dramatically new economic situation in India:
          <br/>
          (i) Manchester imports into India declined as the British mills were busy with war production to meet the needs of the army paving the way for the Indian mills to supply for the huge home market.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) As the war prolonged, Indian factories were called upon to supply war needs. As a result new factories were set up, new workers were employed and everyone was made to work longer hours.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) Cotton production collapsed and exports of cotton cloth from Britain fell dramatically after the war, as it was unable to modernize and compete with US, Germany, Japan. Hence within colonies like India, local industrialists gradually consolidated their position capturing the home market.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 17.
          <br/>
          How did the plantation workers understand the idea of ‘Swaraj’? Explain. (2011 OD)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          For the plantation workers of Assam, “Swaraj” meant freedom to move freely in and out of the confined space in which they all were enclosed and also to be able to keep the link with their native village intact. Under the Inland Emigration Act of 1859, plantation workers were not allowed to leave their tea gardens without permission, which they were rarely given.
         </p>
<p>
          When they heard of the Non-cooperation Movement, thousands of workers defied authorities, left the plantations and headed home.

          <br/>
          The Rowlatt Act was passed despite the united opposition of the Indian members of Imperial Legislative Council.
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           The Act gave the government enormous powers to oppress political agitations.
          </li>
<li>
           It had allowed the detention of political prisoners without trial for two years. There was no provision for appeal.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Three problems faced by the peasants of Awadh were:
         </p>

          Three reasons for lukeivarm response of some Muslim organizations to Civil Disobedience Movement were:
         </p>

<li>
           After the decline of Non-cooperation-Khilafat movement, a large section of Muslims felt alienated from the Indian National Congress.
          </li>

           The visible and open association of Congress with Hindu religious nationalist groups like the Hindu Mahasabha in mid 1920s made the Muslims suspicious of Congress motives.
          </li>
<li>
           The frequent communal clashes not only deepened the distance between the two communities but also there was an important difference over the question of representation in the future assemblies that were to be elected.

          <br/>
          Role of rich peasants:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           Being producers of commercial crops, they were hard hit by trade-depression and falling prices.
          </li>
<li>
           As their cash income reduced, they found it impossible to pay the government’s revenue demand.
          </li>
<li>
           These rich peasants became ardent supporters of the Civil Disobedience Movement.
          </li>
<li>
           For them fight for Swaraj was a struggle against high revenues.
          </li>

          Answer:
          <br/>
          The Non-cooperation Movement gradually slowed down in cities for a variety of reasons:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           Khadi cloth was more expensive than mill cloth and poor people could not afford to buy it. As a result they could not boycott mill cloth for too long.
          </li>
<li>
           Alternative Indian institutions were not there which could be used in place of the British ones. These were slow to come up.
          </li>
<li>
           So students and teachers began trickling back to government schools and lawyers joined back work in government courts.
          </li>
</ol>
<p>

<li>
           The peasants’ movement demanded reduction of revenue, abolition of begar and social boycott of these landlords.
          </li>
<li>
           In many places Nai-Dhobi bandits were organized to deprive landlords of the services of even washermen and barbers.
          </li>
<li>
           In 1920, Jawahar Lai Nehru began talking to the villagers and formed ‘Oudh Kisan Sabha’. Within a month 300 branches had been setup in the villages.
          </li>
<li>
           As the movement spread in 1921, the houses of taluqdars and merchants were attacked, bazaars were looted and grain hoards were taken over.

          </li>
<li>
           The demands of the peasants were: reduction of revenue, abolition of begar and social boycott of oppressive landlords.

          <br/>
          Suppressive measures taken by the British administration were:
          <br/>
          (i) The fear that the lines of communication, such as railways and telegraph, might get disrupted, the British Government started even stronger repressive measures. Local leaders were picked up. Gandhiji was barred from entering Delhi. On 10th April, 1919 the police in Amritsar fired upon a peaceful procession.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) This provoked widespread attacks on banks, post offices and railway stations. Martial law was imposed and General Dyer took command. The government replied with further brutalities.

          How did the Salt March become an effective tool of resistance against colonialism? Explain. (2015 OD, 2016)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Mahatma Gandhi found in salt a powerful symbol that could unite the nation.
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           On 31st January, 1930 he sent a letter to Viceroy Irwin stating eleven demands, one of which was the demand to abolish Salt Tax.
          </li>
<li>
           Salt was one of the most essential food items consumed by the rich and poor alike and a tax on it was considered an oppression on the people by the British Government.
          </li>
<li>
           Mahatma Gandhi’s letter was an ultimatum and if his demands were not fulfilled by March 11, he had threatened to launch a civil disobedience campaign.
          </li>
<li>
           So, Mahatma Gandhi started his famous Salt March accompanied by 78 of his trusted volunteers. The march was over 240 miles, from Gandhiji’s ashram in Sabarmati to the Gujarati coastal town of Dandi.
          </li>
<li>
           The volunteers walked for 24 days, about 10 miles a day. Thousands came to hear Mahatma Gandhi wherever he stopped, and he told them what he meant by Swaraj and urged them to peacefully defy the British.

          “The Congress was reluctant to include the demands of industrial workers in its programme of struggle.” Analyse the reasons. (2015 D)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Some workers did participate in the civil disobedience movement, selectively adopting some of the ideas of the Gandhian programme, like boycott of foreign goods as a part of their own movements against low wages and poor working conditions.
         </p>
<p>
          There were strikes by railway workers in 1930 and dock workers in 1932. Thousands of workers in Chotanagpur tin mines wore Gandhi caps and participated in protest rallies and boycott campaigns. The Congress was reluctant to include the demands of workers as part of its programme of struggle. It felt that this would alienate industrialists and divide the anti-imperial forces.

          Question 35.
          <br/>
          Why did the Non-Cooperation Movement gradually slow down in the cities? Explain (2015 D)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Non-cooperation movement gradually slowed down in the cities for a variety of reasons:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           Khadi cloth was often more expensive than mass produced mill cloth and poor people could not afford to buy it.
          </li>
<li>
           Boycott of British institutions posed a problem for the movement to be successful. Alternative Indian institutions had to be set up so that they could be used in place of the British ones.
          </li>
<li>
           The institutions were slow to come up. So teachers and students began trickling back to the government schools and even lawyers joined back work in government courts.

          Question 36.
          <br/>
          Why did Mahatma Gandhiji decide to withdraw the Non-Cooperation Movement in February 1922? Explain the reasons. (2015 D)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          In February 1922, Gandhiji decided to launch a no tax movement. The police opened fire at the people who were taking part in a demonstration, without any provocation. The people turned violent in their anger and attacked the police station and set fire to it. The incident took place at Chauri Chaura in Uttar Pradesh. When the news reached Gandhiji, he decided to call off the Non-cooperation movement as he felt that it was turning violent and that the satyagrahis were not properly trained for mass struggle.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The Poona Pact:
          <br/>
          (i) Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, who organised the dalits into the Depressed Classes Association in 1930 demanded separate electorates for dalits in the Second Round Table Conference organised in London.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) When British accepted this demand in the name of Communal Award, Gandhiji started a fast into death. He believed that separate electorates for dalits would slow down the process of their integration into the society.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) Ambedkar and Gandhi came to an agreement with Ambedkar accepting Gandhis position and the result was the Poona Pact of September, 1932.
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           It gave the depressed classes (later to be known as Schedule castes) reserved seats in provincial and central legislative councils.
          </li>
<li>
           But, they were to be voted in by the general electorate.

          Question 38.
          <br/>
          Describe the spread of Non-Cooperation Movement in the countryside. (2015 OD)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The Non-cooperation movement spread to the countryside also. It drew into the struggles of peasants and tribals from different parts of India.
          <br/>
          (i) In Awadh, the peasants’ movement led by Baba Ramchandra was against talukdars and landlords who demanded extremely high rents and a variety of other cesses from the peasants. Peasants were forced to work in landlords’ farms without any payment (begar). Peasants had no security of tenure, thus being regularly evicted so that they could acquire no right over the leased land. The demands of the peasants were—reduction of revenue, abolition of begar and social boycott of oppressive landlords.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) In the Gudem Hills of Andhra Pradesh a militant guerrilla movement spread in the early 1920s against the closure of forest areas by the colonial government, preventing people from entering the forests to graze their cattle, or to collect fuelwood and fruits. They felt that their traditional rights were being denied.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) For plantation workers in Assam, freedom meant the right to move freely in and out of the confined space in which they were enclosed. It meant retaining a link with the village from which they had come. Under the Inland Emigration Act of 1859, plantation workers were not permitted to leave tea gardens without permission. In fact the permission was hardly granted. When they heard of the Non¬Cooperation Movement, thousands of workers defied the authorities and left for their homes.

         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           It had tricolours — Red, Green and White.
          </li>
<li>
           It had a spinning wheel in the centre.
          </li>
<li>
           It represents the Gandhian idea of self-help.
          </li>

           Carrying the flag during marches had become a symbol of defiance and a sense of collective belonging.
          </li>
</ol>
<p>
          Question 42.
          <br/>
          How did cultural processes help in creating a sense of collective belongingness in India? Explain. (2011 D)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Though nationalism spread through the experience of united struggle but a variety of cultural processes captured the imagination of Indians and promoted a sense of collective belongingness:
          <br/>
          (i) Use of figures or images. The identity of India came to be visually associated with the image of Bharat Mata. Devotion to the mother figure came to be seen as an evidence of one’s nationalism.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Indian folklore. Nationalists started recording and using folklores and tales, which they believed, gave a true picture of traditional culture that had been corrupted and damaged by outside forces. So preservation of these became a way to discover one’s national identity’ and restore a sense of price in one’s past.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) Use of icons and symbols in the form of flags. Carrying the tricolour flag and holding it aloft during marches became a symbol of defiance and promoted a sense of collective belonging.
         </p>
<p>
          (iv) Reinterpretation of history. Indians began looking into the past to rediscover the glorious developments in ancient times in the field of art, science, mathematics, religion and culture, etc. This glorious time was followed by a history of decline when India got colonized, as Indian history was miserably written by the colonisers.
          <br/>
          All these techniques were used to bring the Indian people together against the common enemy, (any three)

          Question 43.
          <br/>
          Evaluate the contribution of folklore, songs, popular prints etc., in shaping the nationalism during freedom struggle. (2017 D)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          History and fiction, folklore and songs, popular prints and symbols—all played an important role in creating a sense of collective belonging leading to the growth of nationalism.
         </p>
<p>
          1. Image of Bharat Mata:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           With the growth of nationalism, the identity of the Indian nation came to be visually associated with the image of Bharat Mata.
          </li>
<li>
           Moved by the Swadeshi Movement, Rabindranath Tagore painted the famous image of Bharat Mata. The identity of the Indian nation came to be visually associated with this image. She was portrayed as an ascetic figure—calm, composed, divine and spiritual.
          </li>
<li>
           Later this image was painted by many other artists which acquired different forms. This image was circulated in popular prints and devotion to this mother figure was seen as a sign of nationalism.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          2. Reinterpretation of History:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           The glorification of developments in ancient India in the fields of art and architecture, Science and Mathematics, religion and culture, law and philosophy, craft and trade had also helped in the growth of nationalism.
          </li>
<li>
           These nationalist histories encouraged the readers to take pride in India’s great achievement in the past and struggle to change the miserable conditions (cultural and economic decline) of life under the British rule.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          3. Indian Folklore:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Idea of nationalism also developed through a movement to revive Indian folklore.
          </li>
<li>
           Folk tales were sung by bards in the villages, to give a true picture of traditional culture, which had been damaged by outside forces.
          </li>
<li>
           In Bengal, Rabindranath Tagore himself began collecting ballads, nursery rhymes and myths to revive folk culture.
          </li>
<li>
           In Madras, Natesa Sastri published a four volume collection of Tamil folk tales, “The Folklore of Southern India”.

          <br/>
          Explain any five major problems posed by the First World War in India. (2015 OD)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The outbreak of the First World War had created a new economic and political situation in India:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           The increased defence expenditure was financed by war loans and by raising tax rates, custom duties, etc. There was tremendous price rise during the war years. Between 1913 and 1918, the prices had almost doubled. People, particularly common people, were facing extreme hardships.
          </li>
<li>
           Forced recruitment in the army caused widespread anger in the villages.
          </li>
<li>
           The failure of crops in many parts of India had created food shortages, leading to the added misery of the people.
          </li>
<li>
           In addition to this, there was the outbreak of the great influenza epidemic. Millions of people perished due to influenza and starvation.
          </li>
<li>
           The nationalist movement grew stronger during the war years. A large number of Muslims were drawn into the anti-British struggle during the war. The defence of the ‘Caliphate’ (Khilafat) became an important question for Muslims. Peasant movements during war period also had helped the nationalist movement to grow stronger.

          Question 46.
          <br/>
          Explain five points about Gandhiji’s idea of ‘satyagraha’. (2011 OD)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Five points about Gandhiji’s idea of ‘satyagraha’:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           According to Gandhiji, satyagraha is not physical force. In the use of satyagraha there should not be any scope of ill-will.
          </li>
<li>
           Satyagraha is about soul-force and truth is the very substance of soul and the soul is informed with knowledge.
          </li>
<li>
           According to Gandhiji, satyagraha is not the weapon of the weak, instead it can only be used by the strongest of the strong as it totally depends upon mental strength but not on physical strength.
          </li>
<li>
           Gandhiji said “Satyagraha is passive resistance, which is about intense activity but in a non-violent manner.” India cannot rival Britain in force of arms as the British worship the war-god and all of them are bearers of arms. Indians can’t compete with them in arms but can only defeat them using the weapon of “ahimsa” alone/ “that is by using mental strength Indians can defeat the British. Tolerance and non¬violence can only become the pillar of strength for the IndiAnswer:”
          </li>
<li>
           Non-violence is the supreme dharma which could unite all Indians. Without seeking vengeance or being aggressive, a satyagrahi can win the battle.
          </li>
</ol>
<p>
          Question 47.
          <br/>
          What was Gandhiji’s idea behind launching the Non-cooperation Movement? Mention four proposals suggested by Mahatma Gandhi with reference to Non-cooperation Movement. (2011 D)

          <br/>
          Mahatma Gandhi felt (in his book Hind Swaraj, 1909) that British rule was established in India with the cooperation of IndiAnswer: It has survived because of their cooperation. If the Indians refuse to cooperate, British rule in India will collapse and Swaraj would come.
         </p>
<p>
          Proposals suggested by Mahatma Gandhi with reference to Non-cooperation Movement
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           According to Gandhiji, Non-cooperation could become a movement by unfolding in stages.
          </li>
<li>
           It would begin with the surrender of titles that the government awarded and a boycott of civil services, army, police, courts and legislative councils, schools and foreign goods.
          </li>
<li>
           Then if the government used repression, a full civil disobedience campaign would be launched.
          </li>

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Various social groups participated in the Non-Cooperation Movement, each with its own specific aspiration. All of them responded to the call of ‘Swaraj’ but the term meant different things to different people.
          <br/>
          Movement in the cities:
         </p>

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Civil Disobedience Movement came into force in various parts of the country:
          <br/>
          (i) Gandhiji led the salt march from Sabarmati Ashram to Dandi with his followers starting the Civil Disobedience Movement.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Thousands in different parts of the country broke the salt law, manufactured salt and demonstrated in front of government salt factories.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) In the countryside, the rich Patidars of Gujarat and Jats of Uttar Pradesh were active in the movement. As rich communities were very hard hit by the trade depression and falling prices, they became enthusiastic supporters of the Civil Disobedience Movement.
         </p>
<p>
          (iv) As the depression continued and cash invoice dwindled, the small tenants found it difficult to pay the rent. They wanted the unpaid rent to the landlords to be remitted and thus they joined the movement.
         </p>
<p>
          (v) Merchants and industrialists supported the movement by giving financial assistance and also by refusing to buy and sell the imported goods.
         </p>

          (i) Mahatma Gandhi’s famous ‘Dandi March’ from Gandhiji’s ashram in Sabarmati to the coastal town of Dandi and violating the law by manufacturing salt marked the beginning of the Civil Disobedience Movement.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) As the movement spread, foreign cloth was boycotted, liquor shops were picketed and peasants refused to pay revenue and chaukidari taxes. Village officers resigned and forest people ventured into reserved forests to collect wood and graze cattle, thereby violate forest laws.

          Reactions of colonial government to the Civil Disobedience Movement:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Worried by the reaction of the people the colonial government began arresting the Congress leaders one by one.
          </li>
<li>
           Abdul Ghaffar Khan was arrested in Peshawar and later Mahatma Gandhi was arrested which led to violent clashes in many places.
          </li>
<li>
           The Government followed a policy of brutal repression. Peaceful satyagrahis were attacked, women and children were beaten and about 1,00,000 people were arrested.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          Question 52.
          <br/>
          Why did Gandhiji start the ‘Civil Disobedience Movement’? Explain any four features of Civil Disobedience Movement. (2013 OD)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Non-fulfillment of demands made by Gandhiji on behalf of all the members of the Congress led to the launching of the Civil Disobedience Movement in 1930.
         </p>
<p>
          Gandhiji’s ‘Dandi March’ marked the beginning of the Civil Disobedience Movement. Gandhiji started his march with 78 volunteers from his ashram at Sabarmati to the Gujarat coastal town of Dandi. On 6th April, Gandhiji reached Dandi and ceremonially violated the law, manufacturing salt by boiling sea water.
         </p>
<p>
          Features of Civil Disobedience Movement:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           People were now asked not only to refuse cooperation with the British but also to break colonial laws.
          </li>
<li>
           Foreign cloth was boycotted and people were asked to picket liquor shops.
          </li>
<li>
           Peasants were asked not to pay revenue and chaukidari taxes.
          </li>
<li>
           Students, lawyers and village officials were asked not to attend English medium schools, colleges, courts and offices.
          </li>
</ol>
<p>
          Question 53.
          <br/>
          “Dalit participation was limited in the Civil Disobedience Movement”. Examine the statement. (2013 D)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The abstract concept of ‘Swaraf did not move the nation’s ‘untouchables’, who from around the 1930s had begun to call themselves dalit or oppressed.
         </p>
<p>
          The Congress had ignored the dalits, for the fear of offending the Sanatanis, the conservative high caste Hindus.
         </p>
<p>
          Gandhiji persuaded upper castes to change their heart. He himself cleaned toilets to dignify the work of the bhangi. He called the untouchables, Harijans, organized satyagraha to secure them entry into temples and access to public wells, tanks and schools.
         </p>
<p>
          The dalit leaders were keen on a different political solution. Political empowerment, they believed would resolve the problems of their social disability. They began demanding reserved seats in educational institutions and a separate electorate that would choose dalit members for the Legislative Council.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 54.
          <br/>
          “Some of the Muslim political organizations in India, were lukewarm in their response to the ‘Civil Disobedient Movement’.” Examine the statement. (2013 D)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Muslim response was lukewarm to the Civil Disobedience Movement as a large section of Muslims felt alienated from the Congress.
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           The Congress members were seen as associates of Hindu religious nationalist groups like Hindu Mahasabha.
          </li>
<li>
           After the Non-cooperation Movement, relations between Hindus and Muslims worsened as each community organized religious processions, provoking Hindu-Muslim communal clashes and riots.
          </li>
<li>
           The important differences were over the question of representation in the future Assemblies that were to be elected.
          </li>
<li>
           When Civil Disobedience Movement started, there was an atmosphere of suspicion and distrust between communities. Muslims feared that they would be submerged under the domination of a Hindu majority in Independent India.
          </li>
</ol>

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Mahatma Gandhi decided to call off the Civil Disobedience Movement because:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           Worried by the development of Civil Disobedience Movement the colonial government began arresting the Congress leaders one by one.
          </li>
<li>
           This led to violent clashes in many places.
          </li>
<li>
           When Abdul Ghaffar khan, a devout disciple of Mahatma Gandhi was arrested in April 1930, angry crowds demonstrated in the streets of Peshawar, facing armoured cars and police firing. Many were killed.

<p>
          Question 63.
          <br/>
          Why did Mahatma Gandhi relaunch the Civil Disobedience Movement with great apprehension? Explain. (2016 OD)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Mahatma Gandhi entered into a pact with Irwin on 5 March, 1931.
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           By this Gandhi-Irwin Pact, Gandhiji committed to participate in a Round Table Conference in London and the government agreed to release the political prisoners.
          </li>
<li>
           In December 1931, Gandhiji went to London for the conference, but the negotiations broke down and he returned disappointed.
          </li>
<li>
           Back in India, he discovered that the government had begun a new cycle of repressive measures.

<li>
           Abdul Ghaffar Khan and Jawaharlal Nehru were both in jail and the Congress had been declared illegal.
          </li>
<li>

           <br/>
           Thus, with great apprehension Gandhiji relaunched the Civil Disobedience Movement.
          </li>
</ol>
<p>
          Question 64.
          <br/>
          “Nationalism spreads when people begin to believe that they are all part of the same nation.” Justify the statement. (2015 D, 2013 D)
          <br/>
          How did people belonging to different communications, regions or languages develop a sense of collective belonging? Explain with examples. (2014 OD)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          History and fiction, folklore and songs, popular prints and symbols—all played an important role in creating a sense of collective belonging leading to the growth of nationalism.
          <br/>
          Image of Bharat Mata:
          <br/>
          (i) With the growth of nationalism, the identity of the Indian nation came to be visually associated with the image of Bharat Mata (as it had happened in Germany and France: Germania in Germany and Marianne in France).
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) This image was first created and popularized by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay. In 1870, he wrote Vande Mataram as a hymn to the motherland. This song was widely sung during the Swadeshi Movement.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) Moved by the Swadeshi Movement, Rabindranath Tagore painted the famous image of Bharat Mata. The identity of the Indian nation came to be visually associated with this image. She was portrayed as an ascetic figure—calm, composed, divine and spiritual.
         </p>
<p>
          (iv) Later this image was painted by many other artists which acquired different forms. This image was circulated in popular prints and devotion to this mother figure was seen as a sign of nationalism.
         </p>
<p>
          Icons and Symbols (Flag):
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           During the Swadeshi Movement in Bengal, tricolour flag (red, green and yellow), with eight lotuses (depicting eight provinces of British India), was designed.
          </li>
<li>
           Gandhiji had designed the Swaraj flag by 1921—a tricolour (red, green and white) with a spinning wheel in the centre.
          </li>
<li>
           Carrying the flag during marches became a symbol of defiance and a sense of collective belonging.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          Reinterpretation of History:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           The glorification of developments in ancient India in the fields of art and architecture, Science and Mathematics, religion and culture, law and philosophy, craft and trade had also helped in the growth of nationalism.
          </li>
<li>
           These nationalist histories encouraged the readers to take pride in India’s great achievement in the past and struggle to change the miserable conditions (cultural and economic decline) of life under the British rule.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          Indian Folklore:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Idea of nationalism also developed through a movement to revive Indian folklore.
          </li>
<li>
           Folk tales were sung by bards in the villages, to give a true picture of traditional culture, which had been damaged by outside forces.
          </li>
<li>
           In Bengal, Rabindranath Tagore himself began collecting ballads, nursery rhymes and myths to revive folk culture.
          </li>
<li>
           In Madras, Natesa Sastri published a four volume collection of Tamil folk tales, “The Folklore of Southern India”.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          Question 65.
          <br/>
          “Plantation workers had their own understanding of Mahatma Gandhi’s ideas and the notion of ‘Swaraj.” Support the statement. (2017 D)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          “The plantation workers in Assam had their own understanding of Mahatma Gandhi and the notion of Swaraj” —
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           For plantation workers in Assam, freedom meant the right to move freely in and out of the confined space in which they were enclosed.
          </li>
<li>
           Under the Inland Emigration Act of 1859 plantation workers were not permitted to leave the tea gardens without permission.
          </li>
<li>
           Swaraj meant retaining a link with the village from which they had come.
          </li>
<li>
           When they heard of the Non-cooperation Movement, thousands of workers defied the authorities, left the plantations and headed home.
          </li>
<li>
           They believed that Gandhi Raj was coming and everyone would be given land in their own village.
          </li>
</ol>
<p>

          <br/>
          How did the Colonial Government repress the ‘Civil Disobedience Movement’? Explain. (2017 OD)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The British Government reacted very strongly to the movement of Indians against the passage of the Rowlatt Act
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           British officials were alarmed by the popular upsurge. The fear that the lines of communication, such as railways and telegraph, might get disrupted, the British Government started even stronger repressive measures.
          </li>
<li>
           The colonial government began to arrest the Congress leaders. Gandhiji was barred from entering Delhi. On 10th April, 1919 the police in Amritsar fired upon a peaceful procession.
          </li>
<li>
           This provoked widespread attacks and people began to attack the symbols of British rule. There were attacks on banks, post offices and railway stations. Martial law was imposed and General Dyer took command.
          </li>
<li>
           The government’s repression was quite brutal. Even women and children were beaten up. About 1,00,000 people were arrested.
          </li>
</ol>
