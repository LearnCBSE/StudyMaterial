          Question 1.
          <br/>
          Read the passage given below: [12]
          <br/>
          1. All of Earth’s oceans share one thing in common: plastic pollution. Discarded plastic bags, cups, and bottles make their way into the sea. Today, it seems that no part of the ocean is safe from plastic trash. In recent years, oceanographers have searched in vain for a pristine marine environment. They have found plastic everywhere they have looked. “It is a common global problem, we can’t point to a single habitat or location with no plastic”.
         </p>
<p>
          2. Plastic harms wildlife and introduces dangerous chemicals into marine ecosystems — communities of organisms interacting with their surroundings. Once plastic enters the environment, it lasts a long time. Scientists are working to prevent plastic pollution from entering the sea.
         </p>
<p>
          3. When people litter, or when trash is not properly disposed of, things like plastic bags, bottles, straws, foam beverage cups get carried to the sea by winds and waterways. About 80 percent of ocean plastic originates on land. The rest comes from marine industries such as shipping and fishing.
         </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
          4. In 2015, engineer Jenna Jambeck at the University of Georgia and other researchers calculated that at least 8 million tons of plastic trash is swept into the ocean from coasts every year. That’s the equivalent of a full garbage truck of plastic being dumped into the sea every minute. If current trends in plastic production and disposal continue, that figure will double by 2025. A report published by the World Economic Forum last year predicts that by 2050, ocean plastic will outweigh all the fish in the sea.
         </p>
<p>
          5. In today’s world, plastic is everywhere. It’s found in shoes, clothing, household items, electronics, and more. There are different types of plastics, but one thing they all have in common is that they’re made of polymers — large molecules made up of repeating units. Their chemical structure gives them a lot of advantages : they’re cheap and easy to manu-facture, lightweight, water-resistant, durable, and can be moulded into nearly any shape.
         </p>
<p>
          6. Unfortunately, some of the properties that make plastics great for consumer goods also make them a problem pollutant. Plastic’s durability comes in part from the fact that unlike paper or wood, it doesn’t biodegrade, or break down naturally. Instead it just fragments, or breaks into tiny pieces over time. These tiny pieces, known as microplastic, can potentially stick around for hundreds or perhaps even thousands of years.
         </p>
<p>
          7. Another problem with plastics is the other chemicals they contain, like dyes and flame retardants. When plastic isn’t disposed of properly, these additives end up in the environment. Plastic also tends to absorb harmful chemicals from its surroundings. “It’s like a sponge for persistent organic pollutants.” These long-lasting, toxic substances include pesticides and industrial chemicals. If plastic absorbs the chemicals, and marine organisms eat the plastic, they may be exposed to higher concentrations of these contaminants.

          8. One- of the biggest impacts of plastic pollution is its effect on sea life. Seals, sea turtles, and even whales can become entangled in plastic netting. They can starve to death if the plastic restricts their ability to move or eat. Or the plastic can cut into the animals’ skin, causing wounds that develop severe infections.

</div>
<p>
          9. Sea turtles eat plastic bags and soda-can rings, which resemble jellyfish, their favourite food. Seabirds eat bottle caps or chunks of foam cups. Plastic pieces may make an animal feel full, so it doesn’t eat enough real food to get,the nutrients it needs. Plastic can also block an animal’s digestive system, making it unable to eat.
         </p>
<p>
          10. Plastic and its associated pollutants can even make it into our own food supply. Scientists recently examined fish and shell-fish bought at markets in California and Indonesia. They found plastic in the guts of more than a quarter of samples purchased at both locations. In organisms that people eat whole, such as sardines and oysters, that means we’re eating plastic too. In larger fish, chemicals from plastic may seep into their muscles and other tissues that people consume.
         </p>
<p>
          11. One way to keep the ocean cleaner and healthier is through cleanup efforts. A lot of plastic waste caught in ocean currents eventually washes up on beaches. Removing it can prevent it from blowing out to sea again. Beach clean-up is ocean clean-up.
         </p>
<p>
          12. Cleanup efforts can’t reach every corner of the ocean or track down every bit of microplastic. That means it’s critical to cut down on the amount of plastic that reaches the sea in the first place. Scientists are working toward new materials that are safer for the environment. For example, Jambeck and her colleagues are currently testing a new polymer that breaks down more easily in sea water.
         </p>
<p>
          13. “Individual actions make a big difference,” says Jambeck. Disposing of plastic properly for recycling or trash collection is a key step. “And simple things like reusable water bottles, mugs and bags really cut down on waste,” she says. Skipping straws or using paper ones helps too. Ocean pollution can seem overwhelming, but it’s something everyone can help address. This is a problem we can really do something about.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          It is the discarded plastic bags, cups and bottles that generally cause pollution in the sea.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) How does plastic in oceans harm marine ecosystems?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Plastic introduces dangerous chemicals into marine ecosystems.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) How is microplastic formed?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Plastic does not biodegrade or break down naturally. It just fragments or breaks into tiny pieces over time thus forming microplastic.
         </p>
<p>
          (iv) WTiy is plastic compared to a sponge?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Since plastic too tends to absorb harmful chemicals from its surroundings, it is compared to a sponge.
         </p>
<p>
          (v) What is the biggest impact of plastic pollution on sea life?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Sea animals like seals, sea turtles and even whales can become entangled in plastic netting. They can thus starve to death if the plastic restricts their ability to move or eat. Plastic can even cut into the animals skin, causing wounds that lead to severe infections.

</p>
<p>
          Question 2.
          <br/>
          Read the passage given below: [8]
          <br/>
          1. Getting enough sleep is as important as taking time out to relax. A good night’s sleep is essential for preserving the health of your brain and gives you the best chance to meet the coming day with a razor sharp mind. An average person needs about six to eight hour sleep a night —although it is also true that you need slightly less than this, as you grow older —another advantage of aging stress and sleep deprivation often feed on each other, since stress tends to make it harder for you to fall asleep at night anti sleep deprivation in itself causes stress.
         </p>
<p>
          2. Eventually, too little sleep can dramatically interfere with the performance of your memory —something you obviously want to prevent. If you are not getting enough sleep, try going to bed 30 to 60 minutes earlier than your normal bed time for a few days. Lie down on the bed and try to relax by dissociating yourself from your daily routine work. This is normally enough to catch up on any sleep deprivation.
         </p>
<p>
          3. If/however, you suffer from insomnia you should seek the advice of your doctor. The chances,are it is already affecting your ability to remember and recall information — and if you are struggling to improve your memory’ scores, this could be at the root of your problems. Prolonged periods of insufficient sleep can deplete your immune system, make you more accident prone and even cause depression — this can also reinforce a more negative outlook on life, which can contribute to your stress burden. The good news is that your memory and mood should automatically improve once you improve your sleep patterns. Tackle your sleep issues and everything else should fall into place.
         </p>
<p>
          4. Because stress management is so essential to maximize your brain power, if you are not in the habit of setting aside time to relax, make it a priority to do so. Even a minute or two of deep breathing can start to work wonders. Often the best ideas and memories can come to you when you are in a state of relaxation as it is during these moments that your brain stores, processes and plays with the information it has received.
         </p>
<p>
          5. Meditation has long been part of religious and spiritual life, specially in Asia. Today, more and more people are adopting it in Western countries also, for its value in developing peace of mind and lowering stress. There is some evidence that regular meditation can have real sleep gain and health benefits particularly in terms of protecting your brain against aging.

          2.2 Summary: Getting sleep is as important as relaxing as it preserves mental health and sharpens the brain. A six to eight hours sleep at night is required by an average person and as one ages sleep deprivation sets in. Lying down on bed and relaxing helps to catch up on sleep deprivation. Those suffering from insomnia should seek the doctor’s advice because prolonged periods of insufficient sleep cause a lot of problems. Stress management maximizes brain power and regular meditation helps to lower stress and develop peace of mind.

Since won® .play a very important role in the progress of the family and society it must be ensured that they are educated so that they can become financially independent. An educated and financially independent woman is not only confident but also credible of participating in important matters of decision making, for themselves, their families, the society and the nation. An educated woman has the skill, information and ^elf-confidence that she needs to be a better parent, worker and citizen. Our’country needs independent and empowered women and this is possible only through education.

In keeping with the good reputation and goodwill that your showroom has earned over the years, 1 expect an immediate action from your end. I am enclosing a copy of the bill and warranty for your reference.

          Question 5.
          <br/>
          Write a debate in 150-200 zvords either for or against the motion: ‘Capital Punishment should be abolished’. [10]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Capital punishment has been a way of punishing wrong-doers since centuries. Although there are some countries that have abolished it, there are still many which carry out capital punishment. Good Morning everyone! I…., have come before you all to speak against the motion ‘Capital punishment should be abolished’. By speaking against the motion i am keeping in mind those people who commit heinous crimes like cold blooded murder or rape. They should be given death penalty, which is as severe a punishment as the crime they have committed. This would act as a deterrent to others in the society from committing such unpardonable offences. It would also help in reducing the rate of crime in a country.
         </p>
<p>
          The perpetrators would be forced to consider the consequences of their wrong acts when they have the fear of capital punishment in their mind.
          <br/>
          I would like to conclude by saying that capital punishment has been used to maintain the balance of justice since historical times and this mode of punishing hard-core criminals in the severest way helps to create a fear of the repercussions of an atrocious act.
          <br/>

          <br/>
          Good morning Respected Principal Maam, Teachers and Dear Friends.
          <br/>
          I, Arun, have come before you all to speak on the usefulness of yoga. Yoga means the experience of unity with one’s inner being. Yoga, is the Sanskrit word for “union”.
          <br/>
          It has been a practice that uses postures and breathing techniques to induce relaxation and improve strength. In the last few years the benefits of yoga have gained acknowledgment and popularity the world over. Yoga has now become a way of life with the aim ‘a healthy mind in a healthy body.’ Man is a physical, mental and spiritual being and yoga helps to promote a balanced development of all the three.
          <br/>
          Other forms of exercises like aerobics, jogging etc. assure only physical well-being. They have little to do with the development of the spiritual body. Yogic exercises recharge the body with cosmic energy which facilitates attainment of perfect equilibrium and harmony, promotes self-healing, removes negative blocks from the mind and toxins from the body and also reduces stress and tension. One feels rejuvenated and energised with yoga. Yoga’s popularity world wide is because people have realised the essence of self-contentment and inner peace and understand that yoga is the only and best w7ay to attain these two essentials. Yoga also helps in the prevention of ailments like hypertension, diabetes, arthritis etc. With its numerous benefits to control the body and the mind the usefulness of yoga cannot be denied or overlooked.

          Question 6.
          <br/>
          Hard work and punctuality are essential for a happy and successful life. They help in meeting the desired targets of our life. You are Kavya/Kanha. Write an article in 150-200 words highlighting the importance of hard work and punctuality in a student’s life. [10]

          Importance of Hard Work and Punctuality
          <br/>
          By: Kanha
          <br/>
          Hard work and punctuality go hand in hand and are essential for a happy and successful life. These virtues lay down the foundation for success and help us in fulfilling the desired targets that we set for ourselves. These twro qualities are most important in a student’s life and’can enable them to overcome many barriers.
          <br/>
          Punctuality enables one to do a great deal of work within a stipulated time. A hard working student will always be punctual because it is important for him to complete his task on time. Punctuality brings efficiency in its trail and enables one to give in his best. A punctual student will always be aware of the value and importance of time and by managing his time he will be able to put in more labour to a given task.
         </p>
<p>
          When students maintain punctuality, work can be executed successfully and smoothly and they are able to command respect among all. The value of being punctual and hard working needs to be developed from a very young age. They are the keys of success and enable one to complete his task in a relaxed and patient way.
          <br/>
          Thus, hard work and punctuality always give a positive result. If students make these two virtues their way of life, they make certain that they are on the path of success.

          Blood Donation Camp
          <br/>
          By: ABC
          <br/>
          A blood donation camp was successfully organized in our locality, Gandhi Nagar, by an NGO —’For Your Health’ on 22nd September, 20xx. A team of six doctors and twelve nurses from the Government Hospital came to the appointed area in a bus that was equipped with beds and other necessary apparatus, required for collection of blood. The donors were required to fill up a form after their medical parameters were checked to ensure their health being conducive to blood donation. A normal person can donate blood every six months.
         </p>
<p>
          More than five hundred people visited the camp and most of them donated blood. All the donors were served refreshments like a banana, an apple and a glass of fruit juice. Almost 460 units of blood were collected. Later, the President of the NGO delivered a vote of thanks. She thanked all the donors for their act of charity. She reiterated the fact that every drop of blood counts to save a life and the donated blood would be used for the sick and injured persons.
          <br/>
          Certificates were given to all those who donated blood. It was most heartening to see the overwhelming response of the residents to this blood donation camp.

          (e) How did the writer indicate that Dr. Sadao’s father was a very traditional and conventional man?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Mr. Hamel blamed various people for different reasons for neglect of learning on the part of boys like Franz. First he blamed the parents for not being anxious to have their children learn. He blamed the boys themselves for preferring to work on mills and farms. He also blamed himself for sending boys on errands for his convenience.
         </p>
<p>
          (b) To ‘build a swimmer’ out of Douglas, the instructor began his training with extreme caution. He attached a rope to a belt and put it around Douglas. The rope went through a pulley that ran on an overhead cable. Supported by the cable, they went to and fro in the pool and practiced for weeks together. The instructor taught Douglas to put his face under water and exhale and to raise his nose and inhale. He then taught him to kick in water for many weeks. Finally after seven months, the instructor told him to swim the length of the pool and Douglas’ persistent fear started fading.
         </p>
<p>
          (c) At Champaran, Gandhiji fired the share croppers from injustice and exploitation using civil disobedience. The Champaran episode was a landmark in the Gandhian style of fighting against the British. Through this episode, Gandhiji declared that the British could not order him about in his own country. Self reliance, Indian independence and help to sharecroppers were all bound together.
         </p>
<p>
          (d) The chief astrologer placed his finger on his nose in absolute wonder when a baby, barely ten days old, opened his lips in speech. Not only did the baby enunciate clearly but he also raised intelligent questions, which was incredible and left the astrologer transfixed in stupefaction.
         </p>
<p>
          (e) Dr. Sadao’s father was a very traditional and conventional man. Everything in his bedroom was Japanese to please him, as he would never in his own home sit on a chair or sleep in a foreign bed. So, his bedroom floor was deeply matted. Moreover, Dr. Sadao had fallen in love with Hana only after ensuring that she was Japanese because he knew his father would never have received her unless she had been pure in her race.

          Through this statement the writer wants to state that though these ragpickers live on the outskirts of Delhi, the conditions in which they live are most miserable and pathetic. Delhi, the capital city of India, is a flourishing and developed city but Seemapuri, despite its close proximity to Delhi is devoid of the basic necessities like drainage, sanitation and running water. People live in structures of mud, with roofs of tin and tarpaulin. These slum dwellers have been living here for more than thirty years, without an identity and without permits. Survival in Seemapuri means ragpicking. It is indeed ironical that
          <br/>
          despite being located on the edge of the capital city, Seemapuri is a place with stinking lanes that has crude shelters and crumbling walls.

          ‘The Rattrap’ focuses on human loneliness and the need to bond with others. Comment.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The main focus of the story ‘The Rattrap’ is on human loneliness. All the characters, whether it is the peddler, the crofter,_ the ironmaster or his daughters, suffer from loneliness. The peddler is a lonely man who has always been shunned by society’s cold and unkind words. When he knocks at the door of the old crofter’s cottage he does not expect hospitality but the crofter welcomes him as he is too happy to get someone to talk to after being alone for so long. By serving the peddler the crofter is in fact serving himself. He serves the peddler with supper, gives him tobacco and plays ‘mjolis’ with him. He is a very good host. The ironmaster and his daughter too miss company and this makes them all the more lonely on the occasion of Christmas. So the ironmaster, who mistakes the peddler for his old regimental comrade, invites him to his manor house for Christmas. The ironmaster’s daughter, Edla, extends this invitation again and tells the peddler he can leave any time after Christmas. Thus the need to bond is the main focus of the story ‘The Rattrap’.

          Derry and Mr. Lamb both are victims of physical impairment, but their attitudes towards life are completely different. Elaborate.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Mr. Lamb and Derry both suffer from a physical impairment but their behaviour and attitude towards people is rather different. Mr. Lamb always maintains a positive attitude towards life and accepts things that come his way without grumbling. He believes in the quality of universal brotherhood and always keeps the gates of his garden open. Derry, on the other hand, is a victim of inferiority complex and always being conscious of his handicap is full of bitterness. Derry’s suffering is further aggravated by other peoples’ lack of concern, sympathy and compassion. Mr. Lamb’s conversation with Derry about everyone being essentially the same and his notion about beauty being relative baffle Derry who is at first unable to understand Mr. Lamb’s ideology. Later though he is attracted to Mr. Lamb because he feels there is something mystical and spiritual about him.

          Answer:
          <br/>
          The Governor of HM Prison, Oxford, despite being an extra cautious man, is actually quite gullible and he, quite unfortunately, over-estimates himself. His judgement of people is rather poor. Due to his average intelligence he is not able to comprehend and understand Evan’s shrewdness. He ignores vital matters that require his personal attention. Searching McLeery and escorting the wounded McLeery needed his personal supervision but he neglected these. He became rather casual at the critical times and fails to grasp the complexity of the situation. However, he does reveal a mark of intelligence when he locates the hotel where Evans is hiding on the basis of the correction slip. But then again he ignores the vital issues and finally is unable to capture Evans.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The internet revolution has ushered in an era of drastic change in our lives, especially in that of the youth. Significant availability and affordability have made internet easily accessible. Good Morning everyone! I…….., have come before you all to speak against the motion. ‘Indulgence of the youth in the use of the internet is a great bane for them.’ According to a study, the use of the internet has become so popular that at an average student accesses it at least once in a day and spends approximately eight hours a week . online. It is of great use to the youngsters to provide information on any topic. It has also been researched that individuals remember events and facts in more detail for longer periods of time when the information is audio-visually aided. Internet is also a powerful source of learning and an efficient means of communication.
         </p>
<p>
          The internet is a huge learning bank and keeps expanding the resources that are available to the students. This information is way beyond the print material found in school libraries. Moreover, searching for information on the internet helps to develop a student’s learning skills as it sharpens the ability to find relevant information. It also contributes to a broader understanding of communication technologies and is also beneficial for the students in their career plans.
          <br/>
          To conclude, 1 would like to say that there are always two sides of a coin. Youth indulgence in the use of internet will not be a bane for them if it is used judiciously and sensibly.

          Outdoor exercise, morning or evening walk during winter months has become difficult in the polluted metropolitan cities. This scenario has made indoor (team) games important. Good Morning students! Today your Principal has come before you all to persuade you to make more use of the facilities for basketball, badminton etc. available in our school. During any kind-of aerobic activity one usually inhales more air and breathes in more deeply. So to stay healthy while you exercise, your focus must be on the ways to minimize your exposure to the extremely polluted air of our metropolitan city. You can limit the effects of air pollution by playing more of indoor games like badminton, basketball, table tennis etc. Indoor activities would not only give you the needed exercise but will also protect you from the atmospheric pollution.
         </p>
<p>
          I urge you all to make more use of the facilities of indoor games that are available in our school. Our basketball court, badminton and table tennis halls are open for students even after school hours and I would once again request you all to bring a variation in your routine by taking out time for the indoor games. I know you all are aware of the great benefits of playing these indoor games especially with the dangerous levels of air pollution outside.

          I will conclude my speech with the hope that I will see many more students making use of our indoor games areas.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) The village elders were sitting in the back benches in the classroom because they were sorry that they had not gone to school for longer period. It was their way of thanking their master, M. Hamel for his forty years of faithful service and of showing their respect for their mother tongue and country that was theirs no more.
         </p>
<p>
          (b) Douglas preferred to go to YMCA swimming pool to learn swimming because it was safe. It was only two or three feet deep at the shallow end; and although it was nine feet at the other end, the drop was quite gradual.
         </p>
<p>
          (c) Seeing the cultural and social backwardness in the Champaran villages, Gandhiji appealed for teachers. Mahadev Desai and Narhari Parikh, Gandhiji’s disciples and their wives, volunteered for the work. Primary schools were opened in six villages. Gandhiji’s wife taught the ashram rules on personal cleanliness and community sanitation.

<p>
          (d) The ten-day old prince Jilani Jung Jung Bahadur performed a great miracle. An astonishing phrase came out from the lips of the prince who addressed the prophets. Everyone stood transfixed in stupefaction. They looked wildly at each other and blipked.

          (e) Dr. Sadao informs General Takima about the American’s presence in his house and agrees to have him killed by the General’s private assassins. He also agrees to leave the outer partition of the white man’s room open to the garden and tells the general if they could also remove his body.
         </p>

          Through the story of the bangle-makers of Ferozabad, the author expresses her concern over their exploitation in the hazardous job of bangle-making. Extreme poverty, hard work and dismal working conditions result in the loss of the childhood of children who are in this profession. The working conditions of all bangle-makers are pathetic and miserable. They work in high temperature, badly lit and poorly ventilated glass furnaces due to which child workers especially are at risk of losing their eyesight at an early age. The stinking lanes of Ferozabad are choked with garbage and humans and animals live together in these hovels. There is no development or progress in their lives with the passage of time. They have no choice but to work in these inhuman conditions. Mind-numbing toil kills their dreams and hopes. They are condemned to live and die in squalor, subjected to a life of poverty and perpetual exploitation.

          Sophie belongs to a lower middle class family and lives a humble life with her parents and elder brother. But her dreams far supercede the reality in which she is living. Her dreams are far beyond her reach. So she wishes to open a boutique, entertains the idea of being an actress and also aspires to be a fashion designer. Her dreamy disposition and romantic allusions lead her to hero-worship the wonder-footballer, Danny Casey towards whom she develops a romantic fascination. Though she sees him only once in person she sits for hours imagining Danny coming to her. The incurable dreamer in her remains an escapist who wánts to remain away from her real world.

          Question 6.
          <br/>
          People like to travel to their places of work in their own cars. It is comfortable and they also reach their destinations more or less in time. However, use of private vehicles leads to pollution and traffic jams and it is expensive also. Air-conditioned public buses, which are smaller in size, seating 15-20 people and tickets, reasonably priced can be a boon for the people. Write an article in 150-200 words on the topic ‘Need of better Public Transport’. You are Resham/Rehana. [10]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Need of Better Public Transport
          <br/>
          By: Resham/Rehana
          <br/>
          It is convenient for people to travel to their work-place in their own cars. It is also comfortable and enables them to reach their destination more or less on time. But use of these private vehicles is not only expensive but leads to pollution and traffic jams also. The need of the present times is, air-conditioned, smaller sized public buses, with a seating capacity of 15-20 people with reasonably priced tickets. These will prove to be a boon for daily office commuters. Their journey will be less stressful and will give them time to relax. It will also cut down their expense on fuel and will also be a good alternative which will help in reducing the air pollution as one bus would cover for at least ten cars.
         </p>
<p>
          Moreover, a better public transport system will not only offer smarter travel choices, but will also enable people to leave their private cars behind and travel more sustainably. Vehicular traffic accounts for about 45 percent of all greenhouse gas emission. So boosting our public transport will be an effective way to reduce these emissions without a large capital investment. Also by reducing gridlocks, public transport options can enable a reasonably smooth traffic flow.
          <br/>
          What is needed is to invest in better traveling options for the daily commuters. A better form of public transportation, with all that it entails, will be an important step towards a sustainable future.

          Diwali Mela
          <br/>
          By: Amit/Amrita
          <br/>
          Our school put up a two-day Diwali Mela on the 30th and 31st October 20xx in the school grounds. This mela was inaugurated by Mr. Sandeep Kumar, Chairman of our Education Society. These two days witnessed a general atmosphere of fun and gaiety.
          <br/>
          Various food and gift item stalls and games stalls were put up by the students under the able guidance of our respected teachers. Added to this furr and enthusiasm was a social cause wherein a platform had been provided for an NGO working for the education of the girl child. They had put up a stall to exhibit and sell hand-crafted diyas and gift items made by their volunteers.
          <br/>
          On the second day of the mela there was a song and dance programme. Our students put up an entertaining cultural programme. Prizes were awarded to the participants.
         </p>
<p>
          The highlight of this Diwali Mela was that there were no fireworks. It was a cracker-free Mela that celebrated the true essence of Diwali as a ‘festival of lights’.
          <br/>
          Our principal appreciated and applauded the teachers and students for their sincere and whole-hearted efforts for successfully organising the Diwali mela. He commended our efforts and made a special mention congratulating the students for having a pollution-free cracker-free Mela.

          Question 8.
          <br/>
          Answer any five of the following questions in 30-40 words each: [2 × 5 = 10]
          <br/>
          (a) How did M. Hamel make his last lesson a special one? What did he emphasize in it?
          <br/>
          (b) Which two incidents in the life of William Douglas before he was ten years old created an aversion in his mind to water?
          <br/>
          (c) Why did Gandhiji not accept C.F. Andrew’s help during the Champaran movement?
          <br/>
          (d) How did the Tiger King ‘manage to kill’ the hundredth tiger?
          <br/>
          (e) What was Hana’s role in Dr. Sadao’s life when he brought home an injured American soldier?
          <br/>
          (f) We can’t approve of Jack’s attitude towards his wife. Comment.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) To make his last lesson a special one, M. Hamel had new copies for his students. The words ‘France, Alsace, France, Alsace’ were written on them in a beautiful round hand. They looked like little flags floating everywhere in the classroom. He emphasized the fact that French language was the most beautiful language in the world and they needed to guard it among themselves.
         </p>
<p>
          (b) When Douglas was three or four years old, his father took him to the beach in California where he was knocked down and swept over by the waves as he stood with his father on the surf. Later when he was ten or eleven years old, a big bruiser of a boy picked him up and tossed him into the deep end at the YMCA pool. Both these incidents instilled a fear of water in him.
         </p>
<p>
          (c) Though Gandhiji’s lawyer friends thought it would be a good idea for C.F.Andrews to stay in Champaran and help them, Gandhiji vehemently opposed it. He said that if they had an Englishman on their side it would show the weakness of their heart.
         </p>
<p>
          (d) The Tiger King believed that he had managed to kill the hundredth tiger that had been brought to the forest where the Maharaja was hunting, by the Dewan and his wife. This tiger wanders into the Maharaja’s presence and he takes a careful aim at the beast and thinks he has killed the hundredth tiger. However, the hunters realised that the tiger had only fainted from the bullet shot. So one of the hunters takes aim and shoots the tiger.
         </p>
<p>
          (e) First Hana washes the wounded man’s face and body with warm water till it was quite clean. She then assists Dr. Sadao during the operation even though she has never even witnessed an operation before. She brings in the towels and though she is not comfortable at the sight of the bleeding wound, she gives anaesthesia to the patient.
         </p>
<p>
          (f) Jack is a dominant male whose general attitude towards women is disapproving. After coming down from Jo’s room he watches his wife labour, with utter weariness. He feels caught in an ugly middle position wherein he does not want to speak to or work with his pregnant wife without any reason.
         </p>

          Question 9.
          <br/>
          Answer of the following in 120-150 words: [6]
          <br/>
          What kind of life did children living in Seemapuri lead?’
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Most of the people like Saheb-e-Alam settled in Seemapuri were refugees from Bangladesh who had fled their country and migrated to Delhi from Dhaka in the wake of the 1971 Indo-Pak war. Their dwellings were structures of mud, tin and tarpaulin with no sewage, drainage or running water. Picking garbage and rags helped them to earn their daily bread, gave them a roof over their heads and was their only means of livelihood and survival. Though these squatters of Seemapuri have no identity but they do have valid ration cards that enable them to buy grain.
         </p>
<p>
          Living in Seemapuri, which is on the periphery of Delhi, is like living in hell. Children here grow up to become partners in survival to their parents. An army of barefoot children appears every morning, carrying their plastic bags on their shoulders and disappear by noon. They are forced to live a life of abject poverty that results in the loss of childhood innocence.
          <br/>
          Saheb, a ragpicker, roamed in the streets, scrounging for garbage, barefoot and deprived of education. Later he starts working in a tea stall but he loses his freedom and carefree life as he is no longer his own master.
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          How did the crofter tempt the peddler to steal his money? How did it change the peddler’s life?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          One dark evening when the peddler was walking along the road he knocked on the door of a cottage to seek shelter for the night. To his surprise, he was welcomed by an old man, the crofter, who lived alone in the cottage. The lonely crofter was happy to find a man whom he could talk to. He served the peddler supper, gave him tobacco and played a game of cards with him. The old crofter then went to the window and took down a leather pouch.
         </p>
<p>
          He counted three ten kronor notes and put them into the pouch. This provided a big bait for the peddler who was tempted to steal the notes. The peddler unwillingly allowed himself to be tempted to touch the bait and was thus trapped in. He stole the money and thus committed a breach of trust. So he betrayed the confidence reposed in him by his host. After stealing the crofter’s money he turned off the road, and ventured into the woods. There he got completely lost in the big and confusing forest. Later the whole forest seemed to close in upon him like an impenetrable prison from which he could just not escape.
