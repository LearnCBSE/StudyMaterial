           1. Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follow: (10)
          </span>
</p>
<p>
          1. We live in an age of wonders and miracles. It has been called the ‘Age of Science’ and different aspects of our life that changed in the preceding centuries have been attributed to science. This is completely true, but it is only one side of the coin. The flip side is that as we have advanced more in the field of technology, something fundamental to humanity has been left behind. Values such as empathy and concern for our fellow human beings are gradually being eroded due to the onslaught of our ever-evolving lifestyles, aided by the marvels of technological advancements
         </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
          2. Take the example of the Internet. On the one hand, access to information and knowledge at the click of a button is a veritable boon to everyone (especially students) and this has made our lives much simpler. On the other hand, it has severely limited actual contact with teachers, friends and elders. Thus, the learning that a person gains is incomplete as he or she cannot easily take the advice that another person can give on the basis of knowledge and practical experience that is at his or her disposal.
         </p>
<p>
          3. Today, a small child can access and navigate the Internet with an ease that still astounds those from the older generation. But what is even more astounding is the neglect of the basic human traits of friendship, relationships and family values. Owing to all the technological advancements and the gadgets available today, children often miss out on the most enriching childhood experiences such as playing outdoor games with friends, which apart from being immensely enjoyable and physically exhilarating, also develop traits such as teamwork and discipline at an early age.
         </p>
<p>
          4. But now when the concept of friends is gradually being limited to virtual friends on social networking sites, one shudders to think of the implications for the personality development of a child because the time spent with computers or mobile phones for entertainment can never really substitute for the holistic benefits of outdoor play. Such examples can be found in plenty.

</p>
<p>
          5. Now if we compare the hustle and bustle of modern city life and the peace and calm of a rustic village life, we can see that in cities, life is a race with a variety of factors. It is a race that everyone tries their level best to win, but nobody actually wins as it never ends.
         </p>
<p>
          6. As for me, I think this age of rapid development has created at least as many problems as it has solved, if not more. The reason is that the basic goal of life, which should be the pursuit of happiness, has now been replaced by the pursuit of money. Money and happiness are considered analogous in our present society, but they actually are not so. In this mindless pursuit of money, nobody has time now to appreciate the beauty of life, which consists not of multi- billion-dollar skyscrapers, but a simple act of kindness to someone in a time of need.
         </p>
<p>
          7. So there is an urgent need to stop for a moment and think about where we are actually heading, is it development or destruction? Do we have to wait until people have grown so much apart from each other that we cannot see the suffering of our own species due to our mindless greed, or can we still mend our ways?
         </p>
<p>
          8. To answer this question, I will take the help of that most magnificent of human feelings-hope. I sincerely wish that we, as the most intelligent species on earth, would take our fair share of responsibility and sincerely think about the path we should follow. Though mankind will possibly last for a long time thanks to its determination and sheer ingenuity, we have to make sure we do not lose our humanity somewhere along the way.

          The Global Teacher Prize
          <br/>
          The Global Teacher Prize is a US 1 million award presented annually to an exceptional teacher who has made an outstanding contribution to their profession. A few years ago, an educational charity called the Varkey Foundation was concerned that many problems around the world are caused by lack of education. They decided to ask Populus, a leading research company, to find out more, by comparing education in countries around the world.
         </p>
<p>
          One section was on how teaching compares with other professions. Their investigation also covered many other key topics, such as are children encouraged to become teachers. The results of this survey, published in 2013, shocked the chairman of the Varkey Foundation, whose parents had both been teachers. Therefore, in the same year, he decided to establish the Global Teacher Prize, with the overall intention of raising the profile of the teaching profession. The first prize was awarded in 2015.
         </p>
<p>
<img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 11 English Set 3 with Solutions" height="16" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Learn-CBSE.png" width="116"/>
</p>
<p>
          The process of choosing a winner is a lengthy one. People can name a teacher they know, or a teacher can apply themselves. In the first year, teachers from 127 different countries were nominated, and over 5,000 applications were received. After the closing date, a team of judges carefully selects 10 finalists, who gather in Dubai for an exciting event where the award is presented.
         </p>
<p>
          The winner in the first year was Nancie At well, a teacher from the USA, and media interest in her success was enormous. After accepting her prize, Nancie gave a speech in which she talked about the fact that as a teacher you can make a real difference to students’ lives. Nancie discovered a love of books when she was a child, and went on to become an English teacher. Like many other teachers, she enjoys the chance to be creative in he classroom. She developed a technique called the writing-reading workshop, which she first described in her bpok ‘In The Middle’.
         </p>
<p>
          The 2016 competition was also a great success. The award was presented to a primary school teacher called Hanan A1 Hroub. She developed her own specialist teaching approach, which is based on developing trusting and friendly relationships with students, paying attention to their individual needs, and above all, rewarding positive behaviour.
         </p>
<p>
          She wrote about this in her book ‘We Play and Learn’, which has inspired other teachers to review the way they teach. Would you consider going into the teaching profession? After all, no two days are the same, which is what attracts many to teaching in the first place. Perhaps the Global Teacher Prize can inspire more people to try to become the Outstanding teachers of the future!

</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #0000ff;">
           3. Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow:
          </span>
</p>
<p>
          1. Reading Comprehension (RC) is the most peculiar section in almost all scholastic, entrance and employment tests. The skills in RC make a lot of difference in one’s chances of good grades/selection.
         </p>
<p>
          2. Most students find it difficult to tackle topics that are diverse from the field they are in or from which they are comfortable with. So one needs to develop a taste for even the most obscure and boring topic on this planet. For success in RC one should be able to understand it. And even with an average speed, one can succeed if one implements the strategies.
         </p>
<p>
          3. Broadly speaking, RC passages can be classified in a few categories. Fact based RC is the simplest form of RC. These types of passages have a lot of information in the form of names, numbers, etc. In these types of passages, one should read very fast. Don’t try to memorise any facts. Just mark what the author is talking about in each paragraph.
         </p>
<p>
          4. Inference based RC is the toughest form of RC. Here, the passage is fairly tough to understand. This includes passages on topics like religion, spirituality, philosophy etc. Most of the students will be comfortable attempting these passages. The way to master them is to read them again and again.
         </p>
<p>
          5. Topic based RC includes passages on any particular topic like economics, astrology, medical sciences, etc. Generally what makes these passages difficult is usage of technical terms. For success in these types of passages, we need to have a fair understanding of the definition of the term if it is defined in the passage. Assume them to be non-existent and proceed. The key principle in these passages is that don’t go to the next line until the previous line is clear.
         </p>
<p>
          6. Reading the question first and then passage is the usual strategy followed by a few students. They just look at the questions and not options. The objective is that after seeing the questions when you read the passage then you read only that part carefully where the answer is given. The flaw with this strategy is that you will not be able to remember all the questions. Besides this, the strategy fails when there are questions that require understanding of the passage. Therefore, the best way to attempt an RC is to understand the passage very well first and then to answer the questions.
          <br/>
          (a) On the basis of your reading the passage, make notes using recognisable abbreviations wherever necessary. Use a format you consider suitable, supply a suitable title. (5)
          <br/>
          (b) Make a short summary of the passage in about 50 words. (3)

          1.3. Make a lot of difference in getting good grades
         </p>

<p>
          Reading Comprehension is the most peculiar section which can be found in almost all tests. It makes a lot of difference in getting good grades. Comprehension passages can be classified into fact based passages, inference based passage’s and topic based passages. Inference based passages are the easiest to attempt. The usual strategy of students is to first look at the questions. then read the passage and answer them. But this is not a good strategy. One must read and understand the passage first and then answer the questions.

          Role of Youth in Curbing Corruption
          <br/>
          Respected Principal, teachers and my fellow students, good morning to all. Today, I, Anita Verma of class XI, am going to present my views on the “Role of youth in curbing Corruption”. Corruption is a habit and hence everyone who is in important position, is susceptible to it.
         </p>
<p>
          There are people who are ready to compete for those jobs with greater chances of corruption and those who don’t have the chance, expect to minimise the corruption apo keep complaining about it. But prevention and eradication of corruption is an absolute requirement for better public life. The youth has to rise at their personal level in the fight against corruption, as it is a matter of individual’s integrity.
         </p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
          Education is the key to eradicate corruption. Young people must say ‘No’ to donations and private tuitions. We must promote a system of selection for jobs based on merit rather than based on bribes. Higher education is the key to eradicating corruption from our nation. It is ultimately the question of building national character.
         </p>
<p>
          National character is nothing hut the collective awareness combined with braveness. The youth should not allow themselves to become money making machines. We must take a pledge today to end corruption at all levels.

          The progress of a nation depends on empowering the women. Obsessed with this idea, write a speech for the Youth Conclave on the topic, ‘Empowering the women’.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Empowering the Women
         </p>
<p>
          Respected Chairperson participants and my dear audience, good morning to all. Today, I, Anita Verma, am here in this Youth Conclave to present my views on the topics Empowering the Women’. Women are the foundation of a society. They are the ones on whom the progress of a nation depends.
         </p>
<p>
          But the women are not given their rightful place in the society. Many of them still suffer under family violence and face inferior status in the society. They are denied the basic rights—Right to education and freedom of speech. The growth and development of a nation depends on the status of equality given to the citizens. Women are not treated as equal to men. Many efforts are being made to empower the Indian women.
         </p>
<p>
          Still much is left to be achieved. We must realise that women too have the right to education, right to gender equality and the freedom of speech. Education will make the women self-reliant and will boost their confidence. They will become financially independent, thus leading them to the path of development. It is the need of the hour that we stop exploiting women and give them their rights.
         </p>
<p>
          People must show supportive attitude towards women so that they get equal opportunities to move ahead towards a better society. ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ is one scheme started by the government to educate the girl child. People must change their attitude towards women and give them their due place in the society.

          Question 9.

          Answer:
          <br/>
          Our Large Population is not a Cause or Poverty but an Asset
          <br/>
          A very good morning to all the Jury Members, Friends and Fellow Opponents. Today, I XYZ of class 12, would like to express my views against the motion ‘Our large population is not a cause of poverty, but an asset.’ I will speak against the topic. Be it IT jobs, sales, HP or marketing, job hunters frantically crowd at job fairs and career seminars. The literates, skilled and semi- skilled try their hand digitally or knock at various doors for the so-called interview.
         </p>
<p>
          Yes, this is a fact. Dear friends, due to unchecked population, unemployment has become a serious social issue and a major challenge for the State and Central Governments. With the population reaching 1.3 billion and with more and more hungry mouths to feed, natural and man-made resources are unable to cope with the rising demand for food, shelter and clothing.

          Poverty is glaring at our face even in the supersonic age. Reason? Our large population. Twenty-two per cent of population is still below the poverty line, according to official statistics. To add more, theft, kidnapping, rape, robbery and burglary in most cases are committed by the migrant labourers living in slums on the outskirts of towns and cities. Many a time, the teeming, unregistered population find their names in the voters’ list just to

          Answer:
          <br/>
          Tuition at Coaching Centres is not Essential
          <br/>
          Good morning everyone,
         </p>
<p>
          Today, coaching classes have become ubiquitous in the lives ot city students. It is impossible to imagine students’ lives without them. But here the question that arises is are they really essential or more advantageous to us? Today I am going to present my views in favour of the topic Tuition at Coaching Centres is not Essential’. No, I don’t agree that we have to go to coaching centres to perform well in our exams.
         </p>
<p>
          In fact, going to coaching classes results in the wastage of a lot of time which we could have used for self-study. I believe that our school teachers are far better equipped to handle our syllabus and our requirements related to that. This is for the simple reason that they do not work for any other motive than for our benefit. Coaching centres, on the contrary, are only money-making machines that operate only for financial motives. I ask you how many of us can actually go to a teacher at the coaching centre and sit with him to clear our doubts, but we can always do this with our school teachers.
         </p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
          Our school teachers know our strengths and our weaknesses and work in accordance with that. In fact, the feedback that goes to parents from the school inspires or influences us to perform better. How many coaching centres are bothered to send our performance feedback to our parents. Performance, my friends, depends on our efforts not on coaching centres.
         </p>
<p>
          It depends on how well we can understand the concepts, practice those concepts, know our strengths and weakness and work on them and for all that I am sure schools are any day a better choice than coaching centres. They should re-orient their teaching towards competition, i.e., they should also impart competition oriented education in addition to the routine syllabus.
          <br/>
          Thank you.

          Option (D) is correct.
          <br/>
          Explanation: The plant that is described in the poem is a laburnum tree. This is evident from the lines “In the afternoon yellow September sunlight,” and “A few leaves yellowing, all its reeds fallen.” Laburnum trees are yellow in color, and they shed their leaves in the fall.

          Answer:
          <br/>
          Wu Prof. Gaitonde and Khan Sahib were travelling by Jijamata Express. The train was going from Pune to Bombay. After a long tunnel, the train stopped at small station called Sarhad. Here, Khan Sahib spoke to Gaitonde. He informed him that the area of British Raj began at that station.
         </p>
<p>
          He asked if Gaitonde was going to Bombay for the first time. Gaitonde replied in positive because it seemed that he was in a new world where everything was different from what he had known. Gangadhar Pant, then, asked Khan Sahib how he would go to Peshawar.
         </p>
<p>
          Khan Sahib said that he would go to Delhi from Bombay, then to Lahore and from there to Peshawar. Thereafter, Khan Sahib spoke a lot about his business which Gangadhar Pant listened with interest. He did so because this was giving him some idea of the life of this new India he was in.

          <br/>
          Answer any one of the following questions in about 120-150 words: (6×1=6)
          <br/>
          Describe the narrator’s experience of early morning ride with his cousin Mourad in the story ‘The Summer of the Beautiful White Horse.’
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          It was summer. Early one morning the narrator’s cousin Mourad came to his house. He was sitting on a beautiful white horse. He invited the narrator to enjoy a ride. The narrator got ready and leaped onto the horse behind Mourad. In less than three minutes they were in the open. The horse began to snort. They let the horse run as long as it felt like running.
         </p>
<p>
          Then, Mourad asked the narrator to get down as he wanted to ride alone. The narrator agreed on the condition that Mourad would let him also try to ride alone. Mourad kicked his heels into the horse. The horse stood on its hind legs, snorted, and began to run. Mourad made the horse run across a field of dry grass to an irrigation ditch.

</p>
<p>
          He crossed the ditch on the horse. Five minutes later he returned. Now it was the narrator’s turn to ride alone. When he got onto the back of the horse, it ran down the road to a vineyard instead of running across the field to the irrigation ditch. It began to leap over vines. It had hardly leaped over seven vines when the narrator fell off. The horse kept running, and then disappeared. It took Mourad half an hour to trace the horse and bring it back.

          There lies a great difference between textbook medicine and world of practicing physician. Discuss.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          There lies a great difference between text book medicine and the world of practicing physician. Text book medicine is purely a science whereas treating a patient is an art. The world of practicing physician requires a different set of skills and knowledge.
         </p>
<p>
          Text book medicine no doubt provides the conceptual framework for treatment but no doctor can treat a patient without the use of his or her intuitive practices. In the story ‘Birth’, the way Andrew brings back life in the still born child is a testimony to this fact.
         </p>
<p>
          The nurse at first dumps the child thinking it to be dead. But Andrew takes a chance and the miracle happens. He, in the beginning, applies his text book knowledge but the child does not recover. He does not lose heart. He applies his own intuitive method and the miracle then happened. Treatment is science and beyond. It is both a science and an art. The story ‘Birth’ is a realistic fiction.
         </p>
<p>
          In other words, the elements of the story have been taken from real life experiences and woven in the fabric of fiction. Textbook medicine may give a physician information regarding the symptoms of an ailment and the treatment to be administered to the patient but he cannot rely on it.
         </p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
          While practicing he has to bring in several innovations keeping in view the complexity of the case. We observe that Andrew rightly diagnosed from the symptoms that the child was suffering from Asphyxia Pallida. It was a case of suffocation or unconsciousness caused by lack of oxygen and excess of carbon dioxide in the blood, accompanied by paleness of the skin, weak pulse and loss of reflexes. He knew treatment also and gave it to the child, but the child did not respond. Then, he used an innovation and the child recovered. A practicing physician has to use his mind along with his knowledge of text book medicines.
