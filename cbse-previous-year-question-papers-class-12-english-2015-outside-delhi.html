<p>
          Question 1.
          <br/>
          Read the passage given below carefully: [12]
          <br/>
          1. For four days, I walked through the narrow lanes of the old city, enjoying the romance of being in a city where history still lives – in its cobblestone streets and in its people riding asses, carrying vine leaves and palm as they once did during the time of Christ.
         </p>
<p>
          2. This is Jerusalem, home to the sacred sites of Christianity, Islam and Judaism. This is the place, where there is a church of the Holy Sepulchre, the place where Jesus was finally laid to rest. This is also the site of Christ’s crucifixion, burial and resurrection.
         </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
          3. Built by the Roman Emperor Constantine at the site of an earlier temple to Aphrodite, it is the most venerated Christian shrine in the world. And justifiably so. Here, within the church, are the last five stations of the cross, the 10th station where Jesus was stripped off his clothes, the 11th where he was nailed to the cross, the 12th where he died on the cross, the 13th where the body was removed from the cross, and the 14th, his tomb.
         </p>
<p>
          4. For all this weighty tradition, the approach and entrance to the church is non descriptive. You have to ask for directions. Even to the devout Christian pilgrims walking along the Via Dolorosa – The Way of Sorrow – first nine stations look clueless. Then a courtyard appears, hemmed in by other buildings and a doorway to one side. This leads to a vast area of huge stone architecture.
         </p>
<p>
          5. Immediately inside the entrance is your first stop. It’s the stone of anointing: this is the place, according to Greek tradition, where Christ was removed from the cross. The Roman Catholics, however, believe it to be the spot where Jesus’ body was prepared for burial by Joseph.
         </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
          6. What happened next? Jesus was buried. He was taken to a place outside the city of Jerusalem where other graves existed and there, he was buried in a cave. However, all that is long gone, destroyed by continued attacks and rebuilding; what remains is the massive – and impressive – Rotunda (a round building with a dome) that Emperor Constantine built. Under this, and right in the centre of the Rotunda, is the structure that contains the Holy Sepulchre.
         </p>
<p>
          7. “How do you know that this is Jesus’ tomb?” I asked one of the pilgrims standing next to me. He was clueless, more interested, like the rest of them, in the novelty of it all and in photographing it, than in its history or tradition.
         </p>
<p>
          8. At the start of the first century, the place was a disused quarry outside the city walls. According to the gospels, Jesus’ crucifixion occurred ‘at a place outside the city walls with graves nearby Archaeologists have discovered tombs from that era, so the site is compatible with the biblical period.
         </p>
<p>
          9. The structure at the site is a marble tomb built over the original burial chamber. It has two rooms, and you enter four at a time into the first of these, the Chapel of the Angel. Here the angle is supposed to have sat on a stone to recount Christ’s resurrection. A low door made of white marble, partly worn away by pilgrims’ hands, leads to a smaller chamber inside. This is the ‘room of the tomb’, the place where Jesus was buried.

          10. We entered in single file. On my right was a large marble slab that covered the original rock bench on which the body of Jesus was laid. A woman knelt and prayed. Her eyes were wet with tears. She pressed her face against the slab to hide them, but it only made it worse.

         </p>
<p>
          Question 2.
          <br/>
          Read the passage given below: [10]
          <br/>
          1. We often make all things around us the way we want them. Even during our pilgrimages we have begun to look for whatever makes our heart happy, gives comfort to our body and peace to the mind. It is as if external solutions will fulfill our needs, and we do not want to make any special efforts even in our spiritual search. Our mind is resourceful – it works to find shortcuts in simple and easy ways.
         </p>
<p>
          2. Even pilgrimages have been converted into tourism opportunities. Instead, we must awaken our conscience and souls and understand the truth. Let us not tamper with our own nature of that of the Supreme.
         </p>
<p>
          3. All our cleverness is rendered ineffective when nature does a dance of destruction. Its fury can and will wash away all imperfections. Indian culture, based on Vedic treatises, assists in human evolution, but we are using our entire energy in distorting these traditions according to our convenience instead of making efforts to make ourselves worthy of them.
         </p>
<p>
          4. The irony is that humans are not even aware of the complacent attitude they have allowed themselves to sink in. Nature is everyone’s Amma and her fierce blows will sooner or later corner us and force us to understand this truth. Earlier, pilgrimages to places of spiritual significance were rituals that were undertaken when people became free from their worldly duties. Even now some seekers take up this pious religious journey as a path to peace and knowledge. Anyone travelling with this attitude feels and travels with only a few essential items that his body can carry. Pilgrims traditionally travelled light, on foot, eating light, dried chickpeas and fruits, or whatever was available. Pilgrims of older days did not feel the need to stay in special AC bedrooms, or travel by luxury cars or indulge themselves with delicious food and savouries.
         </p>
<p>
          5. Pilgrims traditionally moved ahead, creating a feeling of belonging towards all, conveying a message of brotherhood among all they came across whether in small caves, ashrams or local settlements. They received the blessings and congregations of yogis and mahatmas in return while conducting the dharma of their pilgrimage. A pilgrimage is like penance of sadhana to stay near nature and to experience a feeling of oneness with it, to keep the body healthy and fulfilled with the amount of food, while seeking freedom from attachments and yet remaining happy while staying away from relatives and associates.
         </p>
<p>
          6. This is how a pilgrimage should be rather than making it like a picnic by taking a large group along and living in comfort, packing in entertainment, and tampering with the environment. What is worse is giving a boost to the ego of having had a special darshan. Now, alms are distributed, charity done while they brag about their spiritual experiences!
         </p>
<p>
          7. We must embark on our spiritual journey by first understanding the grace and significance of a pilgrimage and following it up with the prescribed rules and rituals – this is what translates into the ultimate and beautiful medium of spiritual evolution. There is no justification for tampering with nature.
         </p>
<p>
          8. A pilgrimage is symbolic of contemplation and meditation and acceptance, and is a metaphor for the constant growth or movement and love for nature that we should hold in our hearts.
         </p>
<p>
          9. This is the truth!
          <br/>

          <br/>

          <br/>
          (a) How can a pilgrim keep his body healthy?
          <br/>
          (i) By travelling light
          <br/>

          <br/>

         </p>
<p>
          (b) How do we satisfy our ego?
          <br/>
          (i) By having a special darshan
          <br/>
          (ii) By distributing alms
          <br/>
          (iii) By Making it like a picnic
          <br/>
          (iv) Both (i) and (ii)
         </p>
<p>
          II. Answer the following as briefly as possible: [1 × 6 = 6]
          <br/>
          (c) What change has taken place in our attitude towards pilgrimages?
          <br/>
          (d) What happens when pilgrimages are turned into picnics?
          <br/>
          (e) Why are we complacent in our spiritual efforts?
          <br/>
          (f) How does nature respond when we try to be clever with it?
          <br/>
          (g) In olden days with what attitude did people go on a pilgrimage?
          <br/>
          (h) What message does the passage convey to the pilgrims?
          <br/>
          (i) Find words from the passage which mean the same as the following: [1 × 2 = 2]
          <br/>
          (i) made/turned (para 3)
          <br/>
          (ii) very satisfied (para 4).
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          I.
          <br/>
          (a) (iv) Both (i) and (ii)
          <br/>
          (b) (iv) Both (i) and (ii)
          <br/>
          II
          <br/>
          (c) Earlier pilgrimages were a penance to stay near nature and did not require luxury rooms and big cars to travel, now they have become more of a tourism opportunity where people go for a picnic.
         </p>
<p>
          (d) When pilgrimages turn into picnics, the entire significance of pilgrimage as sadhana is lost. It becomes more of a social gathering, a life of comfort and a boost to ego, where pilgrims don’t achieve spiritual upliftment.
         </p>
<p>
          (e) Pilgrimages are no more of travelling on foot and living in the ashrams with basic necessities, it has become a picnic with all the comfort, AC rooms, travelling by car with a large group to have all the fun and entertainment. We have distorted traditions according to our conveniences. Hence, we are complacent in our spiritual efforts.
         </p>
<p>
          (f) When we try to be clever with nature it does a dance of destruction. Its anger washes away all imperfections that are ruining our bodies because of the extra comfort that we are adapting our bodies to. We are not making any efforts to make our body work and adjust in adverse conditions rather making it all the more tender. Nature is just like everyone’s Amma and would act destructively by affecting our health, etc. Sooner or later nature will force us to understand this truth.
         </p>
<p>
          (g) In older days, pilgrimages were more of a sadhana to love people, stay close to the nature, understand it, stay healthy and eat healthy. It was also for seeking freedom from attachment. They took it as a path to peace and knowledge.
         </p>
<p>
          (h) It conveys the message that pilgrimages are symbolic of contemplation meditation and acceptance and undertaken to understand the realities of life, to stay close to nature and should not be taken as a tourism opportunity where you gather in a large group, enjoy amongst all the luxuries and make a life rest upon only comfort.
          <br/>
          (i) Rendered
          <br/>
          (ii) Complacent.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 3.
          <br/>
          Read the passage given below: [8]
          <br/>
          It is surprising that sometimes we don’t listen to what people say to us. We hear them, but we don’t listen to them. I was curious to know how hearing is different from listening. I had thought both were synonyms, but gradually, I realized there is a big difference between the two words. Hearing is a physical phenomenon. Whenever somebody speaks, the sound waves generated to reach your ears and you definitely hear whatever is said to you. However, even if you hear something, it doesn’t always mean that you actually understand whatever is being said. Paying attention to whatever you hear means you are really listening. Consciously using your mind to understand whatever is being said is listening. Diving deeper, I found that listening is not only hearing with attention, but is much more than that. Listening is hearing with full attention, and applying our mind. Most of the time, we listen to someone, but our minds are full of needless chatter and there doesn’t seem to be enough space to accommodate what is being spoken.
         </p>
<p>
          We come with a lot of prejudices and preconceived notions about the speaker or the subject on which he is talking. We pretend to listen to the speaker, but deep inside, we sit in judgement and are dying to pronounce right or wrong, true or false, yes or no. Sometimes, we even come prepared with a negative mindset of proving the speaker wrong. Even if the speaker says nothing harmful, we are ready to pounce on him with our own version of things.
         </p>
<p>
          What we should ideally do is to listen first with full awareness. Once we have done that, we can decide whether we want to make a judgement or not. Once, we do that, communication will be perfect and our interpersonal relationship will become so much better. Listening well doesn’t mean one has to say the right thing at the right moment. In fact, sometimes if words are left unspoken, there is a feeling of tension and negativity. Therefore, it is better to speak out your mind but do so with awareness after listening to the speaker with full concentration. Let’s look at this in another way. When you really listen to, you imbibe not only what is being spoken, but you also understand what is not spoken as well. Most of the time we don’t really listen even to people who really matter to us. That’s how misunderstandings grow among families, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters.

          Answer:
          <br/>
          Sometimes, we hear people but do not listen to them attentively. The difference between the two synonyms is that one is a physical phenomenon while the other is a conscious use of mind.
          <br/>
          We, as listeners, often have preconceived notions about the speaker. We come prepared with a negative mindset, tend to prove them wrong . and put forward our own version of things. Ideally, we should listen to them, understand their perception and stop judging them in order to avoid misunderstandings.

          Dear Sir,
          <br/>
          Through the esteemed columns of your daily newspaper, I would like to draw the attention of the concerned authority to the rampant abuse of available facilities in the Corbett National Park by tourists and the subsequent endangerment to the environment.
         </p>
<p>
          The tourists not only litter the place with non- biodegradable plastic packets and wrappers but also use wood from the forests for cooking purposes. Excessive trampling of the soil has been reported to have a harmful effect on the natural ecosystem. The tranquility of the habitat, which is so crucial to the resident fauna, is habitually disturbed by the tourists playing loud music in their safari jeeps and during their camps.
         </p>
<p>
          The Corbett National Park is the oldest in the country, established in 1936, to protect the endangered Bengal Tiger. The public should be made aware of the fact that eco-tourism should not be facilitated at the cost of harming the environment. There should be an increase in staff and stricter implementation. The penalty should be implemented for abuse of facilities and allows. Use of only non-polluting fuel should be allowed. It is my humble request that this issue should be immediately be taken up by your esteemed publication to generate further awareness.
         </p>

          Yours sincerely,

          Subject: Exploitation of Teachers.
          <br/>
          Dear Sir,
          <br/>
          It is said that the teachers in privately owned and managed schools in small towns and metropolitan suburbs are being exploited. On the occasion of Teacher’s Day, this issue was brought to light in another national daily, mentioning that the teachers employed in such schools are paid a fraction of their authorized salaries.
         </p>
<p>
          Such malpractice is seen to affect the performance of the teachers in the classroom. The school trust pays these teachers much less than the amount they were promised, leading to resignations and constant changes in the faculty. This has affected students’ performance and led to an atmosphere of uncertainty in the schools, which is detrimental to the cause of education.
         </p>
<p>
          As a nation that prides itself on revering its teachers, it must be noted that we cannot build a future for our students if we do not give due credit to our teachers. The goverment should insure that such schools pay salaries as per the goverment’s fixed pay scales. Payments should be made through banks and the goverment agencies should monitor the salary perks etc. Therefore, I request your esteemed publication to take up this matter in order to investigate the issue further and mobilize the public towards calling for a complete overhaul in the education system of the country.
          <br/>
          Yours sincerely,
          <br/>

          BAN ON THE USE OF ANIMALS
          <br/>
          Good morning everyone, Today I am going to express my views against the motion “Banning the use of animals for dissection”.
         </p>
<p>
          Dissection of animals in the school laboratories provides a practical experience for the theoretical knowledge that students gain from books. They procure an opportunity to actually put their learning into practice. It should not be looked at as unjust practice because such an activity is meant to develop the student’s knowledge of the elements and functions of the living being.
         </p>
<p>
          The dissection of animals has a scientific purpose; it is a mode of hands-on education for students such that they learn outside of the pages of the textbook and actually look at what they are being taught. We should give more credit to the sensitivity and intelligence of our students, so as not to believe that a dissection class will make them more prone to animal violence. Students should be taught the value of animal life by making them understand how an animal has the same kind of organs as human beings that perform similar functions. The governing philosophy behind teaching students to dissect animals should be that life, whether human or animal, is the same; each living being is tied to each other by their inner similarity.
         </p>
<p>
          Thus, a ban on dissection of animals in school laboratories would not be the best course of action. I hope my views on this topic were substantial enough to throw light on this topic.
          <br/>
          Thank you.

          ELECTRONIC MEDIA THE END OF PRINT
          <br/>
          MEDIA
          <br/>
          AGAINST THE MOTION:
          <br/>
          Good morning everyone. Today I take the opportunity to express my argument against the motion on the belief that electronic media (TV news) will bring about the end of print media (newspaper).
         </p>
<p>
          TV news that strives towards authentic and fast reportage is always at risk of fabricating its content to continue being in circulation. The governing principle for the 24-hours news format is that whether or not news constitutes the element of worthiness, it should be covered on the channel. If there is nothing worth reporting then the content can be made sensational just to gain better TRP and currency. It tends to become repetitive and dull, scandals are allowed to become news and popularity becomes the main objective.
         </p>
<p>
          The ambition of TV news is to be the soul guardian of objective truth in the field of journalism can be considered to be a tall claim as more often it becomes a site for the promotion of commercial products and sensational content in the grab of news. Print media is a time tested medium of information dissemination. The time taken to publish engenders that the content of the report has been analyzed and verified to offer a composite picture to the reader. Editorial commentary ensures an informed view of the issues at hand. Newspapers are far from extinction, they are still a tried and time tested mode of receiving the world at our doorstep. Thus, the electronic media can never overrule the print media.
          <br/>
          Thank you.
         </p>
<p>
          FOR THE MOTION:
          <br/>
          The means for obtaining news of the world has been a paradigm shift from newspapers to television, especially due to the arrival of the 24-hours news format, reception of news is constant and on the go. The entire news landscape has changed as we are subjected to the concept of breaking news, that is, receiving news as it breaks and without waiting for the newspaper to arrive the next day with an account of events that have already been telecasted by them. It is helpful to illiterate peole. E-media is faster and environment friendly. The power of the television medium is that the image is a direct message which does not need to be read or deciphered. TV news strives towards authenticity, covering all vantage points for maximum coverage and it is delivered fresh and fast. In such a case, it contributes towards the redundancy of the print media.

          THE EVIL OF RAGGING IN EDUCATIONAL
          <br/>
          INSTITUTIONS
          <br/>
          By Navita/Navtej
          <br/>
          Ragging is an evil heirloom, left over from the British era when it was practised in English colleges and Universities to teach the social hierarchy and instills important values since it was believed that the students were lacking in such knowledge due to their immaturity. Unfortunately, these practices gradually became prevalent in educational institutions. The history of the best educational institutions in India is blackened with traumatic cases of brutal ragging, especially in Engineering and Medical Colleges. Ragging was practiced to enforce traditions and discipline freshers into respecting their seniors and the academic hierarchy at such institutions. In a school, ‘Prefect’ is considered to be a teacher’s substitute. However, that does not mean that he/she can misuse his/her authority and indulge in the abuse of power, which happened in a recent case at a prestigious school.
         </p>
<p>
          Schools are centres of learning and wholesome development, but when power equations within the student, displaying its vulgar aspect, it can lead to fatalities such as continued mental trauma or even death. The solution is to sensitive students and bring awareness to stop the harmful practice of ragging. In order to have able-bodied and healthy-minded future citizens of India, we need to eradicate such practices.

          TOURISM POTENTIAL OF INDIA
          <br/>
          By Navtej/Navita
          <br/>
          India has been blessed with a geographical, cultural and linguistic diversity, which is so rich and varied that one will need a lifetime to explore each and every part of India. The tourism potential of India is immense and still to be explored fully. Each century has brought a new culture to Indian soil leading to a diversified commingling that has shaped modem India.
         </p>
<p>
          India is well known all over the world, for its ancient civilization and the artifacts recovered and being excavated till today, prove the genuineness of the claims.
         </p>
<p>
          The ancient history of our culture has left behind exquisite monuments and temples together with archaeological finds for the tourist who are interested in them. Besides this, our country has been blessed with natural scenic beauty, right from the coast lines and beaches to the majestic mountains and hill stations.
         </p>
<p>
          Tourism is a high-potential industry over the world and there are several economies which are totally based on the tourism industry for their survival. The amount of money involved and high value returns could be mind-boggling and India likely, would successfully develop an infrastructure conducive to the promotion of the tourism industry.
         </p>
<p>
          There are so many places of historical interest, heirlooms left over from the various centuries. From the mosques to the temples and churches, India is a living testament to its vast and varied religious heritage. Being a democratic country, every religion in India has full liberty to celebrate its special festivals in which the entire country participates as a whole. For those, looking to just get away from the madding crowd, hill stations during summers, the sun-kissed beaches in winter and leisure tourism are the go-to options. Over the years, medical tourism has also emerged as an extremely viable option, considering world-class facilities are made available at half the prices here, enabling more people to come to India for their healthcare.
         </p>
<p>
          The options enumerated so far are just some instances of India’s diversified tourist potential. There is so much more waiting to be explored in what can truly be the dream destination for tourists.

          <br/>
          Read the extract given below and answer the questions that follow: [4]
          <br/>
          and
          <br/>
          looked out at young
          <br/>
          trees sprinting, the merry children spilling

          <br/>
          security check, standing a few yards
          <br/>
          away, I looked again at her, wan,
          <br/>
          pale as a late winter’s moon and felt that
          <br/>
          old familiar ache, …………
          <br/>
          (a) How do the trees sprint? [1]
          <br/>
          (b) Why did the poet look at her mother again? [1]
          <br/>
          (c) What did she observe? [1]
          <br/>
          (d) Identify the figure of speech used in these lines. [1]

          OR
          <br/>

          <br/>
          spectacles of steel
          <br/>
          With mended glass, like bottle bits on stones.
          <br/>
          (a) Who are these children? [1]
          <br/>
          (b) What is their slag heap? [1]
          <br/>
          (c) Why are their bones peeping through their skins? [1]
          <br/>
          (d) What does ‘with mended glass’ mean? [1]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) The poetess is driving to the Cochin Airport. When she looks outside, the young trees seem to be moving backwards as the car moves ahead. With the speed of the car they seem to be running fast or sprinting. The poetess represents a contrast between her ‘dozing’ mother and the ‘sprinting’ young trees.
         </p>
<p>
          (b) The poetess looked at her mother again because there were obvious signs that the mother would pass away soon. She was deeply attached to her mother and had the childhood fear of losing her mother. She was pained to look at her ageing, pale face after she saw the world full of life and activity.
         </p>
<p>
          (c) She observed the pale and colourless face of her mother that resembles the late winter moon which lacks brightness as well as strength, like her mother did at that age.
         </p>
<p>
          (d) The figures of speech used in these lines are simile: The “wan, pale” face to the mother is compared to “a late winter’s moon”, and personification: for “trees sprinting…”
          <br/>
          OR
          <br/>
          (a) These are impoverished children of the slums.
          <br/>
          (b) Their slag heap is the heap of waste on which they live, roam and play.
          <br/>
          (c) Their bones are peeping through their skins _ as they are malnourished.
          <br/>
          (d) ‘Mended glass’ means broken spectacles. This shows their poverty and inability to buy new glasses.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 9.
          <br/>
          Answer any four of the following in 30 to 40 words: [3 × 4 = 12]
          <br/>
          (a) What did garbage mean to the children of Seemapuri and to their parents?
          <br/>
          (b) How did Rajkumar Shukla establish that he was resolute?
          <br/>
          (c) ‘Life is what it is all about’ How is keeping quiet related to life?
          <br/>
          (d) Mention any four things of beauty that add joy to our life.
          <br/>
          (e) The manner of his (the Tiger King’s) death is a matter of extraordinary interest. Comment.
          <br/>
          (f) In what condition did Dr. Sadao find the American soldier at the seashore?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Small slum children scrounged heaps of garbage. They expected to get some coins, notes or valuable things in it. Sometimes, they would find a rupee or even a ten rupee note. This gave the hope of finding more. So, they searched it excitedly. For children, garbage was wrapped in wonder. For the elders, it was a means of survival. Thus, garbage has two different meanings.
         </p>
<p>
          (b) Rajkumar Shukla established that he was resolute as he had come all the way from Champaran District in the foothills of Himalayas to Lucknow to speak to Gandhiji. Shukla accompanied Gandhiji everywhere. He also followed him to the Ashram near Ahmedabad. For weeks, he never left Gandhi’s side till Gandhiji asked him to meet at Calcutta.
         </p>
<p>
          (c) The poet says, ‘Life is what it is about …’ as he advocates and suggests the necessity of quiet introspection but does not advocate total inactivity and death. Total inactivity brings death, while stillness entails rest for a moment so that one can have calm self¬realisation as otherwise the people of the world are overactive and always on the move. The poet wants ‘no truck with death.’ Keeping quiet is related to doing activities in a purposeful and thoughtful manner.
         </p>
<p>
          (d) Everything of nature is a thing of beauty and a source of pleasure. Some of them are: the sun, the moon, old and young trees, flowers, small streams with clear water, masses of ferns, blooming musk rose and lovely tales, etc. all of these are the things of beauty.
         </p>
<p>
          (e) The Maharaja of Pratibandapuram was told that a tiger would be the cause of his death and warned him to be careful of the hundredth tiger. When the Maharaja tried to shoot the hundredth tiger it had only fainted.
          <br/>
          The king purchased a wooden tiger to offer to his son as a birthday present. Its silver pierced Maharaja’s right hand. It is ironical that the infection spread and the king died. The manner of death made the prediction come true in the most extraordinary manner,
         </p>
<p>
          (f) Dr. Sadao found the American soldier in a wounded condition at the sea shore. He was very weak and pale. He had a bullet stuck in his wound. His face looked tortured and his back was stained with blood. From his battered cap, he learnt that he was a sailor from an American Warship. He was almost at the verge of death, if Sadao had not saved him.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 10.
          <br/>
          Answer the following in 120-150 words : [6]
          <br/>
          Even today so many among us believe in superstitions. An astrologer predicted about ‘the Tiger King’ that he would be killed by a tiger. He “killed’ one hundred tigers yet was himself “killed” by a tiger. How did the superstitious belief “prevail”?
          <br/>
          OR
          <br/>
          Dr. Sadao faced a dilemma. Should he use his surgical skills to save the life of a wounded person or hand an escaped American P.O.W. over to the Japanese police? How did he resolve this clash of values?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          On his birth, the astrologers had predicted that the Maharaja’s death would be caused by the hundredth tiger. As soon as the Maharaja learnt this, he started killing tigers. This shows that though people believed in superstition, the Maharaja wanted to prove the prophecy wrong. After killing all the tigers in his kingdom, he married a girl whose state had a large tiger population. He killed the tigers in his father-in-law’s kingdom too. He was assured that he had killed hundred tigers and was still alive, but ironically, his death was caused by a wooden tiger. While playing with his son and his wooden tiger, a rough surface pierced Maharaja’s hand causing infection that later led to his death. Destiny had taken its revenge for trying to overrule it. The superstitious belief prevailed as the hundredth tiger led to the Maharaja’s death.
          <br/>
          OR
          <br/>
          A conflict of interests arises in a situation when someone in a position of trust, such as a doctor, has competing interests that make it difficult to fulfill his duties. Dr. Sadao was a Japanese surgeon who lived in Japan during the Second World War. He had spent several years in the United States where he had experienced cultural prejudice and bias. He struggled with issues of duty, wartime medicine and racism. Yet, he risked his life to save an enemy, an American and a prisoner of war. He, like a real hero, stood up for what he believes in and does not calculate the repercussions. His sentimentality for the suffering and would help him rise above narrow national prejudices and extend help and services to an enemy He tends to the soldier, reveals the truth about him to the General and later on helped the soldier escape to safety. He can be viewed as a true hero for his bravery and professional competence.

          Everybody during the last lesson is filled with regret. Comment. (The Last Lesson)

          Sophie lives in a world full of dreams which she does not know she cannot realize. Comment.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          According to the order from Berlin, only German was to be taught in the schools of Alsace and Lorraine. This order left Mr. Hamel, the village people and Mr. Hamel’s students in deep regret. The villagers regretted not having made utmost use of the French lessons that had been given by Mr. Hamel. They had engaged themselves in their profession to earn a living and had not taken their French lessons seriously. The children and the villagers sitting in the class had always thought that they had enough time to learn the language. But now, during the last French lesson, everybody realized their mistake. They realized how little they knew of their native language. They all attended the last lesson to mark their respect towards their teacher and their country, which was no longer theirs.
          <br/>
          OR
          <br/>
          The chapter “Going Places” begins with Sophie telling Julie that one day she would either have a boutique or be an actress. If she ever becomes an actress, she would have the boutique as a side business as actresses do not work full time. This clearly shows that Sophie loves living in a world of dreams. Perhaps, we can take these dreams as being achievable ones. But her fantasy about the football player Danny Casey shows us that she lives completely lost in her world of fantasies. She strongly believes that she has met Danny Casey despite people not believing in her words.
          <br/>
          She is so deeply lost in her world of dreams that she does not even doubt her capability of achieving them.

          Question 4.
          <br/>
          Midday meal scheme in the school introduced by the government serves several purposes. Millions of children from the deprived sections of the society get nutritious food leading to good health, are attracted to the schools, kept from going astray and, thus developed into good citizens. The scheme may have some drawbacks too. Write an article in 150-200 words on all aspects of the scheme. You are Navtej/Navita. [10]

          MID DAY MEAL
          <br/>
          By Navtej/Navita
          <br/>
          The mid day meal scheme in schools was initiated with the dual objective of improving the nutritional status of children in classes, 1-5 in government schools and government-aided schools also encouraging children from socially ‘ and economically disadvantaged backgrounds to attend school regularly. It is a measure taken by the government to ensure that by meeting the nutritional requirements of the students, they would also be helping them in concentrating in school activities. The aim is also to keep children in schools, enable them to devote time to their education rather than leave the school to labour for food or get involved in criminal activities. The scheme estimates that a cooked mid day meal provides a child with a minimum of 300 calories and 8-12 grams of protein. This scheme was revised to cover children in the upper primary section, from the year 2007.
         </p>
<p>
          The programme is carried out with the help of the local authorities. However, certain issues have cropped up. There have been a lot of cases of food poisoning resulting from the partaking of these mid-day meals. In some schools, funds meant for such purposes have been funnelled off into the pockets of those who are in charge of distributing the grains. The government must inquire into all aspects of the schemes, check the supply chain of food grains, impose strict measures for observance of cleanliness in the school kitchens and ensure that the intention with which the scheme was started, i.e., to help the students, continues to be the cornerstone of the scheme.

          IMPORTANCE OF MORNING ASSEMBLY
          <br/>
          By: Navita/Navtej
          <br/>
          The morning assembly in schools starts the day on a cool and calm note, a short breath before the hectic school day begins with classes, courses and extra-curricular activities. It offers a moment of reflection before the working day begins, the school community meets together and the assembly becomes a medium of communicating matters of significance to the students. The morning assembly is a time when the whole school assembles in the field or school auditorium, prays together, shares information and begins the day jointly on a note of quiet reflection, which is so crucial in preparing for the hectic day ahead. The most important thing is that the assembly imparts a clear sense of vision that there are moments of peace, even if the day seems like there is too much on our plates.

          <br/>
          (a) What does Saheb look for in the garbage dumps?
          <br/>
          (b) How was Gandhi treated at Rajendra Prasad’s house?
          <br/>
          (c) Why does one feel ‘a sudden strangeness’ on counting to twelve and keeping quiet?
          <br/>
          (d) Mention any two things which cause pain and suffering (A Thing of Beauty).
          <br/>
          (e) When was the Tiger King in danger of losing his throne?
          <br/>
          (f) What role did the American professor play in bringing Hana and Sadao together?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) For Saheb, the garbage dump was like a mysterious package, full of wonders and magic. He looked for different kinds of treasures in the garbage, like a silver coin or other titbits.
         </p>
<p>
          (b) When Shukla took Gandhi to Rajendra Prasad’s house, he was out of town. The servants knew Shukla as a poor farmer who was pestering their master to help the indigo sharecroppers. Seeing Gandhi with him they presumed him to be another farmer and allowed him to stay as Shukla’s companion.
         </p>
<p>
          (c) Counting to twelve and keeping quiet brings in us a sudden strangeness because we are not used to such quiet and peaceful moments. We fail to understand ourselves, and have created a threat of self-destruction, which will be reduced by counting to twelve.
         </p>
<p>
          (d) The things that cause suffering and pain include the scarcity of people with a noble temperament and the unhealthy and miserable ways in which humanity is searching for meaning in life.
         </p>
<p>
          (e) It happened when a high-ranking British officer visited Pratibandapuram. He was very fond of hunting tigers and being photographed with the ones he had shot. However, he was refused by the Maharaja for hunting as well as being clicked with the killed tigers. This infuriated him and the Tiger King stood a chance of losing his throne for this.
         </p>
<p>
          (f) Dr. Sadao had met Hana at his American professor’s house. The professor and his wife were kind people who wanted to help the foreign students and so invited them to their house. After completing their studies in America, Sadao and Hana returned to Japan and got married.

          Question 10.
          <br/>
          Answer the following question in 120-150 words: [6]
          <br/>
          How different from usual was the atmosphere at school on the day of the last lesson? (The Last Lesson)
          <br/>
          OR
          <br/>
          How different is Jansie from Sophie?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          On usual days, when the school started there would be a huge bustle that could be heard out in the street. Sounds of desks being opened and closed and lessons repeated in unison could be heard. While repeating the lessons, students would put their hands on their ears for better understanding of their lessons and the sound of the teacher’s great ruler rapping on the table could also be heard. But, on the day of the last lesson, the school was as quiet as on a Sunday morning.
         </p>
<p>
          The narrator saw his classmates already in their respective places and Mr. Hamel walking up and down holding the scary iron ruler under his arm. When the narrator felt frightened to enter the class Mr. Hamel kindly told him to quickly go to his place as they were about to begin the class without him. Moreover, he saw some villagers were sitting on the last benches.
          <br/>
          OR
          <br/>
          Though Jansie and Sophie were friends, Jansie was completely unlike Sophie. In the beginning of the chapter “Going places,” when we find Sophie telling Jansie about her dream of having a boutique, Jansie, wearing an expression of doubt, tried to make sense to Sophie by telling her that having a boutique required a good investment. When Sophie replied that she would manage to gather the sum, Jansie again revealed her practical mind by saying that it would take Sophie a long time to gather the required amount.
         </p>
<p>
          She also told Sophie that she would not be made the manager straight away. This shows that Jansie had a fair idea about the hard truth of life, which Sophie lacked. She knew that both Sophie and she were destined to work in a biscuit factory and that Sophie’s dreams were just wishful thinking.

          Question 4.
          <br/>
          Consumerism is increasing day-by-day. Luxu¬ries of yesterday have become necessities of today. The result is that the more we want the more miserable we become. Write a debate in 150-200 words on ‘The only way to minimize human suffering and pain is to control our needs/ You are Navtej/Navita. [10]

          Migration from villages to cities has led to the spread of urban slums. People living in these slums lead a miserable life. Economic disparity leads to the problems of law and order. Write a debate in 150-200 words on the ‘Solution to the problem of misery in the urban slums lies in creating jobs in the villages/ You are Navtej/ Navita.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          ‘There is sufficiency in this world for man’s needs but not for man’s greed’ said Mahatma Gandhi. A respected panel of jury, teachers, my dear friends and not to forget my worthy but misguided opponents. Today, I, Navita/Navtej stand before you to speak for the motion on the topic “The only way to minimize human suffering and pain is to control our needs.”
         </p>
<p>
          We know that there is sufficiency, in this world for man’s needs, but what if a man mistakes his greed to be his need? Unfortunately, this is the scenario of today. The things that were regarded luxuries by our forefathers are now termed as necessities. We cannot imagine life without certain items like a blender, a washing machine or even a mobile phone. But weren’t our forefathers able to lead their lives even without these things? It is time that we understand that we have become slaves of a time when diseases like diabetes weren’t even heard off, why? It was because people worked hard without taking the help of such things and so kept their body’s metabolism running. Whatever be the problem, there is only one simple Solution-Controlling our needs and differentiating them from our greed. The more we enslave ourselves, the more we suffer.
          <br/>
          Thank You.

          Respected panel of jury, teachers, my dear friends and not to forget my worthy but misguided opponents. Today, I Navita/Navtej, stand before you to speak for the motion of the topic “Solution to the problem of misery in the urban slums lies in creating jobs in the villages.”
         </p>
<p>
          Migration is a major issue faced by cities. In search of a better and brighter future and to fulfill their dreams, people from small towns and villages leave their life back home and move to cities. Unfortunately, their dreams shatter as they get to live in the already overpopulated urban slums, where they gradually get entangled in the deplorable conditions. Besides, the economic disparity that they face in the cities leads them to the problems of law and order. But, have we ever wondered what is the root cause of migration and the problems attached to it? Yes, it is the dearth of jobs in their native place. There is a huge scope for expansion in villages and small towns but people refuse to see it. The more jobs we create in villages and small towns, the less people will migrate, thereby leading to an economically as well as medically stronger India.

          Question 6.
          <br/>
          Answer any four of the following in 30-40 words each: [3 × 4 = 12]
          <br/>
          (a) “It is his karam, his destiny.” What is Mukesh’s family’s attitude towards their situation?
          <br/>
          (b) What were the terms of the indigo contract between the British landlords and the Indian peasants?
          <br/>
          (c) How will ‘keeping quiet’ protect our environment?
          <br/>
          (d) Which objects of nature does Keats mention as sources of joy in his poem, ‘A Thing of Beauty’?
          <br/>
          (e) Why did Tiger King decide to get married?
          <br/>
          (f) What was Sadao’s father’s dream for him? How did Sadao realize it?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Mukesh’s family had resigned themselves to their fate. His father was a poor bangle maker and could not send his sons to school. He could only teach them how to make bangles. His family accepted it as their fate and felt that God-given lineage could not be broken.
         </p>
<p>
          (b) Most of the arable land in the Champaran district was divided into large estates that were owned by Englishmen and Indian tenants worked for them. They got the agreements from the sharecroppers to pay them compensation for being released from the 15% arrangement.
         </p>
<p>
          (c) By ‘Keeping Quiet’ the poet means that we should stop all our destructive activities that harm nature. If we count up to twelve and do not talk, the environment will be saved from us.
         </p>
<p>
          (d) The poet says that a beautiful thing is a source of everlasting happiness. The few things that add joy to our life are The Sun, The Moon, a bower of trees and a clear stream of water.
         </p>
<p>
          (e) The Tiger King was able to kill only seventy tigers in his kingdom. To prove the prophecy wrong, he needed to kill thirty more tigers. He decided to marry a girl from a royal family of a state with a large tiger population so that he could kill thirty more tigers.
         </p>
<p>
          (f) Sadao’s father dreamt of a bright future for his son. He wanted him to reach the sky as the limit and take Japan towards a better future too. Sadao understood that education was the most important thing to his father and at the age of twenty-two, he went to America to study Surgery and Medicine. At the age of thirty, he returned having realized his father’s dream.

          Question 11.
          <br/>
          Answer the following question in 120-150 words? [6]
          <br/>
          How did the order from Berlin change the situation in the school? (The Last Lesson)
          <br/>
          OR
          <br/>
          It is not unusual for a lower middle-class girl to dream big. How unrealistic were Sophie’s dreams?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The order from Berlin was received with an uncanny silence in the school. There were new copies for the students with ‘France, Alsace’ written on them. They looked like little flags floating everywhere in the classroom. This was in contrast to the usual scene when the school would be bazzing with activity. The sound of opening and closing of desks, lessons repeated in chorus and the teachers’ great ruler banging on the table could be heard on the street.
         </p>
<p>
          But that day, everyone was working quietly and Mr. Hamel, who was dressed formally in the attire that he never wore except on special occasions, was walking up and down with his terrible iron ruler under his arm. The only sound that was heard was, the scratching of pen over paper. The villagers had gathered in the classroom and were sitting quietly on the lock benches.
          <br/>
          OR
          <br/>
          Sophie was a lower middle class girl who had great aspirations. To achieve a glamorous and sophisticated life, she wanted to own a boutique after she finished school. She felt as if she could save the money by working as a manager, or may become an actress as there was real money in it. She was romantic, who was far off from the reality. Sophie did not have a decent house to live in; her father worked hard to fend for the family and her brother was a mechanic. Her mother worked hard to do the household chores daily.
         </p>
<p>
          But Sophie dreamt of doing something beyond all this and wanted to own a shop like Mary Quant, which would be the most amazing shop that the city had ever seen. She also longed to go to places she had never seen. These places lured her towards them because they were distant and mysterious. Sophie’s dreams would never come true as they were unrealistic and not laced with practicality.
