          Question 1.
          <br/>
          Read the passage given below carefully and answer the questions that follow: [12]
          <br/>
          1. “But have you been to Nimtita? Have you been to the palace there?” Asked the old man in the tea-shop, with the thatched roof. We were in the village of Lalgola, one hundred and fifty miles from Kolkata, and we had just seen our thirteenth nobleman’s palace and found it unsuitable.
         </p>
<p>
          2. “Nimtita? Where is that?” we asked without much interest. We had never heard of the place. “It is sixty miles to the North of here. You drive up the highway. Then you come to a river which you have to cross. A ferry will take your car across. Then up the highway again for twenty miles. A sign tells you where to branch off…It’s on the river Padma, on the eastern bank. It’s the palace of the Choudharys. I’ve been listening to your talk, and I feel you ought to see this one before you give up.”
         </p>
<p>
          3. We were not very hopeful. We had had enough trouble taking free advice from people who had no idea of our needs. Anyway, the question was : do we or do we not undertake this last trip? If we did not like the palace, it might mean either giving up making this film altogether, or seriously changing its nature. We tossed a coin to decide whether to go or not. The coin said, ‘Go!’, and we set out on our sixty-mile journey.
         </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
          4. It was when I was in bed with my right leg in plaster that I had decided the film on . Tarasankar Banerji’s famous short story, ‘The Music Room’ (Jalsaghar). A nasty fall on the stone steps at Banaras had brought about a serious knee injury. I lay in bed and read all the Bengali books I could lay my hands on. Just then, the film distributors were not too keen to take my film for distribution, and may be this was one of the things that made me choose ‘The Music Room’.
         </p>
<p>
          5. Here was a dramatic story which could naturally bring in music and dancing, and distributors loved music and dancing. But here, too, was a story full of feelings. So it would be satisfying for me as an artist. I would cast Chabi Biswas, our greatest actor, in the leading role of the zamindar —the zamindar whose love of the big musical entertainments brings about his ruin. But the most important thing was to find a palace. As we had a low budget, there was no question of having studio-built sets. I knew
          <br/>
          that, if we had the money, my art director could easily build a set which looked like our old palace with the right style. But we just didn’t have the money for it,
         </p>
<p>
          6. Nimtita turned out to be everything that the old man had claimed —and more. No one could have described in words the feeling of utter sadness that surrounded the palace. The river Padma had changed its course over the years, so that now there were endless stretches of sand where once had been villages. The palace itself—Greek pillars and all—was a perfect realization of my dream image. It stood looking out over the stretches of sand with a sad dignity. It had somehow escaped being totally destroyed when the river changed its course. The river had reached within ten yards of the front of the palace—having swallowed the garden—and then stopped. Ganendra Narayan Choudhary, who is seventy and owns a British title and the palace, told us how it happened: “We were having breakfast one morning when we heard a low rumble. We went out to the verandah and saw a big chunk of our estate — almost a square mile of it —going under water, disappearing forever. It all happened in a few seconds. Padma’s appetite is legendary.”
         </p>
<p>
          7. “But aren’t you afraid that the river might encroach further?”
         </p>
<p>
          8. “Oh, yes, the rains bring with them the usual fears.”
         </p>

<p>
          9. On returning from our first trip to Nimtita, I telephoned the author, Mr. Banerji. He had been just as anxious about the location as we were.
         </p>
<p>
          10. “We’ve found our palace at last, Mr. Banerji,” I said.
         </p>
<p>
          11. “Have you? And where is it?”
         </p>
<p>
          12. “At a little known place called Nimtita.”
         </p>
<p>
          13. “Nimtita? There was a note of recognition in his voice.” You don’t mean the palace of the Choudharys, do you?”
         </p>
<p>
          14. “That’s the one.”
         </p>
<p>
          15. “But that’s extraordinary! I haven’t been to Nimtita myself, but I have read about the Choudharys in a history of Bengal zamindars, and it was the music-loving Upendra Narayan Choudhary who served as the model for my rajah.”

          Question 2.
          <br/>
          Read the passage given below carefully and answer the questions that follow: [8]
          <br/>
          1. Physical education which is commonly part of the curriculum at school level includes training in the development and care of the human body and maintaining physical fitness. Physical education is also about sharpening overall cognitive abilities and motor skills via athletics, exercise and various other physical activities like martial arts and dance.
         </p>
<p>
          2. Physical education promotes the importance of inclusion of a regular fitness activity in the routine. This helps the students to maintain their fitness, develop their muscular strength, increase their stamina and thus stretch their physical abilities to an optimum level. Physical fitness helps them to inculcate the importance of maintaining a healthy body; which in turn keeps them happy and energized.
         </p>
<p>
          3. Participating in sports, be it team sports or dual and individual sports, leads to a major boost in self-confidence. The ability to go on the field and perform instils a sense of self-confidence, which is very important for the development of a person’s character. Every victory achieved on the field, helps to boost a person’s self-confidence. Moreover, the ability to accept defeat on the field and yet believe in your capabilities brings a sense of positive attitude as well.
         </p>
<p>
          4. Physical education classes are about participating in the physical fitness and recreation activities, but they are also about learning the overall aspects of physical health. For example, in today’s world the problems of obesity, or anaemia and bulimia are common amongst teenagers. Physical education-provides an excellent opportunity for teachers to promote the benefits of healthy and nutritious food and warn against the ill effects of junk food. Promoting sound eating practices and guidelines for nutrition are some of the very valuable lessons that can be taught through physical education classes at school level. ..
         </p>
<p>
          5. Participation in team sports and even dual sports helps to imbibe a sense of team spirit amongst the students. While participating in team sports, the children have to function as an entire team, and hence they learn how to organize themselves and function together. This process of team building hones a person’s overall communication skills and the ability to get along with different people.
         </p>
<p>
          6. Participation in sports and physical education activities Helps to sharpen the reflexes of the students. It also brings order and discipline to the body movements and helps in development of a sound body posture. The hand-eye coordination improves as well.
         </p>
<p>
          7. Physical education classes also include lessons about the importance of personal hygiene and importance of cleanliness. Thus, these classes help the students to know the important hygiene practices that must be practised in order to maintain health and wellness throughout life.
         </p>
<p>
          8. Physical education classes help to enhance the overall cognitive abilities of the students, since they get a knowledge of the different kinds of sports and physical activities that they participate in. For example, a person who is participating in a specific type of martial arts class, will also gain knowledge of the origins of the martial arts, and the other practices and historical significance associated with it.

You realize that human encroachment and the greed of land grabbing companies are the cause of this.

          SAVE THE TIGERS
          <br/>
          By: Ambika Shukla
          <br/>
          The recent killing of Avni, the tigress, which had two 10-month-old cubs, was very disturbing. Human encroachment and the greed of land grabbing companies are to be blamed for this.
          <br/>
          There is no denying that the forest area in our country, the natural habitat for wild animals, is quickly depleting. The fast takeover by humans is not recent and this has increased the chances and risks of a human-wildlife interaction. Considering the decline in the number of tigers in India, urgent action needs to be taken to ensure that an incident like this does not happen again.
          <br/>
          A major reason that the tigers have become endangered is because of the loss of their natural habitat. It is important to know that the extinction of a single species can lead to the disappearance of others and to the destabilization of entire ecosystems. Thus, word needs to be spread more widely that the tiger and its habitat are under threat and they need our help. We need to powerfully advocate for wildlife. Human activities leading to deforestation and developmental projects that lead to massive exodus of wild animals must be stopped.
          <br/>
          When visiting any wildlife area —follow the forest department guidelines- ‘Don’t leave anything behind except footsteps and don’t take anything except memories.’

          You are Veer/Priti. You are a resident of Chandigarh. You are very concerned about the deteriorating air quality in the northern part of India. You realise that the rising amount of construction work, burning of leaves and garbage, and the lack of both wind and rain are major causes of this state. Write a speech in 150-200 words which you
          <br/>
          will deliver at the school assembly on the occasion of Diwali, in which you voice your concern about the situation.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The deteriorating air quality in the northern part of India is a matter of extreme concern. Good Morning! Respected Principal, teachers and my dear friends. 1, Priti, have come before you all on the occasion of Diwali, to voice my concern about this hazardous scenario.
          <br/>
          The rising amount of construction work, burning of leaves and garbage, and the lack of both wind and rain are major causes of this state. A variety of hazardous and toxic particles and gases from different sources are being emitted into the atmosphere leading to a dyterioratingair quality. A large part of North India wakes up to a “Severe” category of air quality, a day after Diwali, wherein firecrackers add to the already harmful pollution levels.
          <br/>
          The government is implementing reforms to keep pollution in check as contaminated air has become an increasing concern. Anti-pollution laws exist in India but they need to be enforced most stringently. There is also need to reinforce measures to control the deteriorating air quality like using clean energy and clean technology in industries, reducing vehicle usage, planting more trees, etc.
          <br/>
          I would like to conclude by quoting the words of our Prime Minister, “Cleaning our surroundings is also one way of serving Mother India as it is with small chores that big goals are accomplished.”

          A Session with the Psychologist

          By: Noor, Head Girl
          <br/>
          National School, Sonepat
          <br/>
          Our school invited the eminent psychologist, Dr. Madhumita to speak to the students on the topic, ‘How to maintain robust mental health?, on 17th January, 20xx.
          <br/>
          In a lively session, held in our school auditorium, Dr. Madhumita enlightened the students on the need to maintain strong mental health. The ease with which she delivered her speech, without using any technical medical terms, was remarkable. She had the undivided attention of all the students, who it seemed, were mesmerized by her words of wisdom. This fact was evident, because after her lecture was over, many students came up with numerous questions, especially about how to cope up with the stress during examination. Here too, Dr. Madhumita addressed their concerns with patience and gave them some very useful tips on systematic study and revision plans. She even demonstrated few breathing and meditation techniques to help in relieving stress.
          <br/>
          This session with the eminent psychologist which was planned for a duration of two hours lasted for over three hours, thus highlighting the success of this interactive session.
          <br/>
          Dr. Madhumita assured the students that she would try to take out more time for such sessions in future also.

          The Nilgiris Senior Secondary School is holding an inter-school debate on the topic, ‘’School bullies are a menace; they should be expelled’. You will be participating from your scnool in the debate. Write your-debate in 150-200 words choosing a stand for or agains; the motion.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          There is no doubt that school bullies should fall under the ‘Zero’ tolerance rule and they are a menacs but should they actually be expelled? Good Morning everyone! I…, have come.before you.all to speak against the motion, ‘School bullies are a menace; they should be expelled.’
          <br/>
          I feel that expelling a bully from school does not solve the problem of bullying. Children should be taught through love, compassion and counseling the value of being nice to their fellow students. I strongly believe that every person who does something wrong should be given a chance to redeem themselves. Love and perseverance is one of the best ways to teach people to change any negative behavioural characteristics.
         </p>
<p>
          Very often the students who are at the receiving end are the ones who are afraid to speak out It is these students who need to be given the confidence to speak-up. By expelling bullies from school without effecting a change in their behaviour will make them grow up to be unhappy, unsocial human beings. They must get a chance to improve or else they may become victims of unchecked aggression in adulthood.
          <br/>
          I would like to conclude by saying that expulsion of bullies from school is not the solution as it does not address their behaviour. The aim thus should be to understand the cause of disorderly behaviour and help them to develop empathy and concern for others.
          <br/>

          <br/>
          (a) Sophie flits from one dream to another. What trait of her character is brought out by this action?

          (e) What kind of person was Evans?
          <br/>
          (f) Who actually killed the hundredth tiger in ‘The Tiger King’? Why?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Sophie’s flitting from one dream to another reveals that she enjoyed living in her world of dreams which provided her the refuge that she needed from her middle- class reality. Sophie is an incurable escapist who does not want to come out of her dreamland.
         </p>
<p>
          (b) It was in honour of the last lesson that M. Hamel had put on his fine Sunday clothes. He was wearing his beautiful green coat, his frilled shirt and his little black silk embroidered cap that he wore only on inspection and prize days.
         </p>
<p>
          (c) Zitkala-Sa resisted the cutting of her hair because her mother had taught her that only unskilled warriors who were captured had their hair shingled by the enemy. Among their people, short hair was worn by mourners and shingled hair by cowards.
         </p>
<p>
          (d) Aunt Jennifer has been a victim of gender oppression at the hands of her husband. So she creates an alternate world of freedom in her art. She creates tigers who symbolise strength and splendour in contrast to her meek nature.
         </p>
<p>
          (e) Evans is a rather quiet and non-violent person. He has a great presence of mind and is admired for his quick-witted intelligence. He wanted to sit for the O-Level German examination because he was very keen to improve his academic qualification.
         </p>
<p>
          (f) Ironically, the hundredth tiger is not killed by the Tiger King. He does drop down after he is shot by the Maharaja, but he only faints from the bullet shot. The hunters then wonder what they should do. They realize if the Maharaja came to know this they could lose their jobs. So one of the hunters takes aim and shoots the tiger.

          Answer of the following in 120-150 words: [6]
          <br/>
          Give instances from the chapter, ‘The Rattrap’ to show that most of its characters are victims of loneliness.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The main focus of the story ‘The Rattrap’ is on human loneliness. All the characters, whether it is the peddler, the crofter, the ironmaster or his daughters, suffer from loneliness. The peddler is a lonely man who has always been shunned by society’s cold and unkind words. When he knocks at the door of the old crofter’s cottage he does not expect hospitality but the crofter welcomes him as he is too happy to get someone to talk to after being alone for so long. By serving the peddler the crofter is in fact serving himself. He serves the peddler with supper, gives him tobacco and plays ‘mjolis’ with him. He is a very good host. The ironmaster and his daughter too miss company and this makes them all the more lonely on the occasion of Christmas. So the ironmaster, who mistakes the peddler for his old regimental comrade, invites him to his manor house for Christmas. The ironmaster’s daughter, Edla, extends this invitation again and tells the peddler he can leave any time after Christmas. Thus the need to bond is the main focus of the story ‘The Rattrap’.

          Answer:
          <br/>
          Douglas’ near-death experience in his childhood has negative as well as positive outcomes. His misadventure at the YMCA swimming pool results in him developing an acute fear of water which took complete possession of him whenever he was anywhere near water. It ruined his fishing trips and deprived him of the joys of canoing, boating and swimming. But once Douglas decided that he had to overcome his fear of water, it gave him a sense of determination. With his perseverance he made sure that he accomplished what he thought could not be possible. It also made him courageous and developed a positive attitude in him that aided him in achieving the goals he had set for himself.

          Answer of the following in 120-150 words: [6]
          <br/>
          “Things that matter. Things nobody else has ever said. Things I want to think about.” What are the ‘things’ that Derry is referring to? How did Derry’s chance meeting with Mr. Lamb prove meaningful for him? *
          <br/>
          Ans. A remarkable change is seen in Derry’s perception and attitude towards life after meeting Mr. Lamb. He says to his mother that Mr. Lamb had spoken to him about things that no one else had talked to him about. The ‘things’ that Derry refers to are Mr. Lamb’s words of wisdom and his healing touch which inspire him (Derry) to shed his inferiority complex. AZso Read: See Q.
         </p>
<p>
          Mr. Lamb is an elderly gentleman who suffers from a physical handicap. He has a tin leg because his leg had been blown off in the war. The children tease him by calling him “Lamey Lamb” but he does not mind it.
          <br/>
          Derry suffers from an acute sense of self-hatred and rejection because of his burnt face. He feels he is very ugly and so no one will love him. Mr. Lamb too has heard Derry only complain and bemoan about himself. He feels very sad to see a fourteen year old boy giving up on life just because of his physical disability. Mr. Lamb at first startles Derry with his strange talk. He tells Derry he is interested in everything created by God. His encouraging words have a magical effect on Derry. Mr. Lamb’s conversation that everyone and everything is essentially the same, the notion of beauty is relative and his concept of the world and friendship baffle but appeal to Derry and he is fascinated by the old man.
         </p>
<p>
          Mr. Lamb inspires Derry by telling him not to focus on the shortcomings of life and his handicap and instead he should try to enjoy the blessings of life. He tells him to be thankful to God for two arms, two legs, two eyes and ears, a tongue and a brain and advises him to be friendly with everyone around him. Derry’s long conversation with Mr. Lamb helps him overcome his inferiority complex and poor self-esteem.

          ‘The Enemy’ portrays the victory of humanity in a moment of crisis. Illustrate this fact through the actions taken by Dr. Sadao for the enemy soldier.
          <br/>
          Ans. The efforts made by Dr. Sadao to save the American soldier who gets washed by the sea to his doorstep portray the victory of humanity in a moment of crisis. Dr. Sadao rises over narrow prejudices of race and country to help a human being in need. Being a doctor, his priority is to save a dying man even though he belongs to the enemy camp. Basic human goodness overpowers Dr. Sadao and he helps the wounded soldier first by operating on him and saving his life and thereafter by arranging his safe escape. As a doctor, his foremost duty was to save a dying man so he put aside all the other options and respected the ethics of his profession thereby justifying the victory of humanity when one is in a dilemma.

          Sir
          <br/>
          Through the medium of the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I wish to draw the attention of the concerned authorities to develop a vacant land in our area, Raghu Nagar, into a playground for children.
          <br/>
          Our locality is densely populated but it is most unfortunate that there is no playground for the children of our area. They can be seen playing in the streets, along the roads and wherever they find space. This is nothing short of exposing themselves and others to risk. There is a large tract of vacant land near our locality that can be developed into a playground. As it is, the vacant land is being used as a dumping ground which makes the whole area filthy and a breeding ground for many diseases.
         </p>
<p>
          It is rather unfortunate that no department is ready to take up responsibility to maintain this vacant land. On behalf of the residents I request the concerned authorities to initiate action in this regard and make this land useful for people.
          <br/>
          I hope you will publish my letter in your newspaper so that the authorities take up immediate measures to develop the vacant land into a playground for children.

          Subject: Letter of complaint against delivered consignment
          <br/>
          Sir
          <br/>
          This is in regard to the order that we had placed with your company vide bill no. 12345 on 18th April, 20xx for the supply of laptop tables, computer stationery, etc.
          <br/>
          It was extremely disappointing for us when we opened the consignment delivered to us
          <br/>
          on 4th May, 20xx. To our dismay, we found that two of the eight tables that we ordered had wobbly legs and two reams of paper contained defective sheets. It is our request to you to replace these defective items at the earliest. In keeping with the goodwill and the good reputation that your company has earned over the years, we hope to receive a prompt delivery of replacement of the defective items.
          <br/>
          We look forward to an immediate redxessal of our complaint from your end.
          <br/>
          Yours sincerely

          One must have a clear-cut and realistic goal in life. But simply having a goal is not enough. One must also have fire in the belly to achieve the goal that he has set for himself.
          <br/>
          Every teenager has a dream to achieve something in life. Any person without an aim or dream drifts aimlessly and can never achieve success. An aimless life is like a rudderless ship which leads us nowhere.
          <br/>
          I too have a dream that I will work very hard to fulfill. I want to be a pilot. I have spent most of my childhood reading aviation history which has always fascinated me. Moreover, as a pilot I can lead an adventurous life and also get an opportunity to face various types of challenges. An action-oriented and challenging career has always been my passion.
         </p>
<p>
          My first conscious entry into a plane was probably at the age of six or seven years. I can still recall how awestruck I was at the idea that the plane was actually going to fly with so many people on board and thought that the person who was going to fly the plane was probably a demi-God. I was really fascinated by this person who I got to know was called the ‘pilot’ and somehow the idea of flying a plane got stuck in my mind since that tender age.
          <br/>
          My passion for flying a plane has grown with age and today I am so happy that I have started on the voyage of life which will ultimately make me fulfil my dream.

          Write a debate in 150-200 words either for or against the motion: ‘Mobile Phone is proving to be a curse for students’.
          <br/>
          Ans. It is needless to say that this is the age of technolog}r. The most evident example of this is the proliferation of mobile phones which everyone has. Even students proudly flash their smartphones and use them all the time. Good morning everyone, I…, have come before you all to speak in favour of the motion, ‘Mobile phone is proving to be a curse for students.’
          <br/>
          One of the biggest issues, in this regard, is that children are getting an easy access to technology at an age when they are not even ready for it. Parents are often consulting experts as to when they should give their children their first smartphone. Experts say that if a child is given a phone before the age of 16 years, there should be a strict monitoring by the parents to see that they do not use it improperly. Unsupervised use of mobile phones has an adverse impact on academics as children are constantly interrupted and distracted by their beeping devices.
         </p>
<p>
          Excessive use of mobile phones becomes a major distraction for students who waste a lot of time on their smartphones. They delve into the virtual world to such an extent that they forget all the other important things. They are more than likely to get into a delirious state of mind when they spend soo much time on their phones. Excess of mobiles leads to physiological and psychological disorders. They are unable to sleep properly as they are constantly checking their phones. It becomes an addiction leading to insomnia and as a result poor health.
          <br/>
          I would like to conclude by saying that mobile phones have certainly made a deep impact on our lives, but I believe that it has enslaved us to an extent wherein we cannot even comprehend even a day without our smartphone.

          Question 8.
          <br/>
          Answer any five of the following questions in 30-40 words each: [2 × 5 = 10]
          <br/>
          (a) How are Aunt Jennifer and the tigers created by her different from each other in their attitudes?
          <br/>
          (b) What qualities turned the diffident Douglas into a good swimmer?
          <br/>
          (c) Why did Edla decide to entertain the peddler against the wishes of her father?
          <br/>
          (d) Why did Derry refuse to believe what his mother said against Mr. Lamb?
          <br/>
          (e) What facts influenced the authorities to allow Evans to appear in the O-level German?
          <br/>
          (f) What light does Zitkala-Sa’s resistance to the shingling of her hair throw on her character?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Aunt Jennifer is a meek and terrorised lady who has led an oppressed life due to the overbearing dominance of her husband. Aunt Jennifer symbolises female suffering. The tigers she creates are very different from her and are symbolic of male dominance. They are proud, bold, fearless and strong unlike the lady who created them.
         </p>
<p>
          (b) It was Douglas’ strong will power and determination that turned the diffident Douglas into a good swimmer. His desire, diligence and perseverance made him overcome his fear of water. He realized the fact that, “all we have to fear is fear itself”.
         </p>
<p>
          (c) Edla had been very happy that morning when she had thought how homelike and Christmassy she would make things for the poor and wretched peddler. She could not get away from this idea all at once. Moreover, she wanted him to enjoy a day of peace with them and thought they should not chase away someone to whom they had promised Christmas cheer.
         </p>
<p>
          (d) Derry’s chance meeting with Mr. Lamb had a very positive impact on him. Mr. Lamb made him see life from a totally different perspective. He talked to Derry about things that no one else had ever said to him and also told him to ponder about things that mattered. Derry had started speaking the language of Mr. lamb. He tried to impress upon his mother that there was always a vast gap about what Mr. Lamb really was and what people said about him. So he refuses to believe what his mother said about Mr. Lamb.
         </p>
<p>
          (e) The authorities had allowed Evans to appear for the O-level German because he had claimed that he was dead keen to get some sort of academic qualification. Moreover, the Governor thought that there was a very slight possibility that Evans was genuinely interested in the O-level German. Also Evans was a pleasant sort of chap with no record of violence.
         </p>
<p>
          (f) Zitkala-Sa’s resistance to the shingling of her hair suggests that she was a strong and brave girl who believed in fighting against injustice till the end. In spite of being tied fast to a chair, she cried aloud and shook her head all the while signifying that she would not submit tamely and that she was not a coward.

          Question 9.
          <br/>
          Answer of the following in 120-150 words: [6]
          <br/>
          The order from Berlin banning teaching of French stunned everyone. Comment.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Everyone was stunned when M. Hamel announced that was to be their last French lesson. He said that the order from Berlin banned teaching of French in the school and that their new German teacher would come the next day. These words shocked everyone who were present in the class. Franz felt extremely sorry for not learning his lessons and also felt sad that he would never see M. Hamel again. The village elders, who were sitting on the back benches were sorry that they had neglected school and felt remorse for not giving importance to their mother tongue before. Their presence in the class on that day was their way of thanking their master for his forty years of faithful service and of showing their respect for the country that was theirs no more.

          Why did no one in Pratibandapuram experience any sorrow and anguish at the death of the Tiger King?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The story of the Tiger King is a satire representing the conceit of those who are in power. The Maharaja of Pratibandapuram was full of pride and thought he could challenge and change what was destined for him. He put his personal gratification and fulfillment of his own whims above the welfare of his people. Moreover, everyone in Pratibandapuram was probably sure that the astrologer’s prediction would Come true. So, when the King died no one experienced any kind of sorrow or anguish. The King was whimsical and irrational and would exempt or double the tax depending on his varying mood. Such a ruler is not popular among his subjects and no one actually grieves at the death of such a King.

          Question 5.
          <br/>
          Air pollution in our cities is increasing alarmingly. According to environmentalists, vehicles are one of the major contributors to air pollution. They recommend use of public transport by private vehicle owners. People in general are willing to switch over from private to public transport if there is a good system in place. Write an article in 150-200 words on the topic, ‘Importance of an efficient public transport system.’ You are Raghu/Ragini. [10]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          THE IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT
          <br/>
          By: Karan
          <br/>
          Increase in the number of private vehicles in the last two decades has led to an unprecedented rise in air pollution, traffic jams, lack of parking space, road rage, etc. One of the solutions to this problem lies in the use of public transport.
          <br/>
          Use of public transport reduces travel by private vehicles. Public transport is beneficial as it not only eases congestion on roads but also saves fuel, money and energy. When people use public transport they reduce their carbon footprint and conserve energy by eliminating travel that would otherwiseّ Kave been made in a private vehicle. It also gives people energy efficient choices and reduces overall greenhouse gas emissions without reducing the mobility that is so vital to our nation’s economic growth.
         </p>
<p>
          To encourage more people to use public transport the authorities need to improve local train and bus services. Funds need to be allocated to make public transport services accessible and more reliable. A bus with as few as 7-8 passengers is more fuel efficient than an average single occupant car. The recent odd-even rule for cars started by Chief Minister of Delhi, Mr. Arvind Kejriwal was initiated to encourage the use of public transport and thereby reduce pollution caused by traffic. The authorities are working hard to make public more aware of how useful, efficient and less damaging to the environment the use of public transport is.

          It is true that water will become a scarce commodity in the near future. We are notorious for wasting water. We waste water during weddings. We waste water at our homes and also at our schools. Write a speech in 150-200 words on the topic, ‘Water is precious; use it wisely’ to be delivered in the school morning assembly. You are Govind/Govindi.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Water, as we all know, is a valuable asset and most vital for the continuation or ire on earth so there is every need to use water sensibly. Good Morning Respected Principal Sir, Teachers and My Dear Friends. I, Karuna have come before you all this morning to speak on the topic; ‘Water, a valuable asset, conservation at home and at school’.
          <br/>
          As responsible and educated inhabitants of this planet earth, it is our duty to create awareness among others to be a part of the water conscious community. Water should be used strictly according to our need and requirement. The need to conserve water both at home and at school should be reiterated among students. To conserve water we need to reduce loss of water, avoid wasting water and improve water management practices like rainwater harvesting, recycling, etc.
         </p>
<p>
          While learning to implement water conservation principles a few activities can prove to our advantage. These include any beneficial reduction in water loss, its use and waste of resources, avoiding any kind of damage to water quality and improving water management practices that enhance the beneficial use of water. We have to remember that we must use only that much water which we actually need, without ever wasting it. The UN has warned that water scarcity will become one of the most pressing problems on the planet in the coming decades, so it is high time we heeded this warning and learn and practice to conserve water.

          <br/>
          (a) The symbols in the poem include the tigers who are symbolic of Aunt Jennifer’s desire to be strong and fearless like the creatures she has created.

         </p>
<p>
          (b) Sophie’s brother Geoff who was an apprentice mechanic spoke very little and Sophie was jealous of his silence. He was a quiet person who did not make new friends easily.

<p>
          (d) The Tiger King married a girl from.a state that possessed a large number of tigers. Thereafter, he killed five or six tigers each time he visited his father-in-law. In this manner, he had killed ninety-nine tigers, thus bringing him closer to his target after his marriage.
         </p>
<p>
          (e) The village elders were sitting on the back benches on the day of the last French lesson. The old Hauser, the former mayor, the former postmaster were there to show their respect for their language and the teacher. They also wanted to show their respect for their country.
         </p>
<p>
          (f) The Governer took all the necessary precautions to ensure a smooth conduct of the O-level examination. Evans cell was thoroughly checked. His nail file, scissors and razor were taken away. Prison officer Stephens was posted to keep a constant vigil on Evans’ activities. Me Leery, the parson, who had come to invigilate, was also frisked.
