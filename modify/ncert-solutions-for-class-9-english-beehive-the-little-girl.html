<strong>
            III. Discuss these questions in class with your teacher and then write down your answers in two or three paragraphs each.
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Kezia’s efforts to please her father resulted in displeasing him very much. How did this happen?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Kezia used to be afraid of her father because her father talked to her harshly. One day her grandmother told her to make a pin-cushion to gift him on his birthday which was approaching. Kezia took it an opportunity to please him. So, she stitched cotton cloth three sides and looked for the things that could be stuffed into the stitched cloth. Soon she found out many sheets of paper. Actually they contained her father’s speech for the Port Authority. She tore them into pieces and stuffed her case.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           One day when her father looked for the papers, he did not find them. After some time, he came to know that Kezia had tom them into pieces to make a pin-cushion. He got infuriated and beat her with a ruler. Thus, her efforts to please her father resulted in displeasing him very much.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Kezia decides that there are “different kinds of fathers”. What kind of father was Mr Macdonald, and how was he different from Kezia’s father?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In Kezia’s opinion, her father was very harsh. He did not talk to her affectionately but rather he used to speak to her stringently. So she avoided him. She did not want to be in front of him because she was afraid of him. Moreover, her father never spent time with her.
          </p>
<p>
           Macdonald family lived next door to her house. One evening she saw him playing tag with his children. A baby was on his shoulders and two little girls were hanging on to his coat pockets. They were laughing. Also, she saw some boys turn the hose on Macdonald and he tried to catch them laughing all the time. She found them feel friendly with their father. So, she wished if her father were like them.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           How does Kezia begin to see her father as a human being who needs her sympathy?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           One night Kezia had a nightmare which made her too terrified. She was crying out of fear. When she woke up, she found her father beside her bed with a candle in his hand. He asked her what the matter was. When he came to know about her nightmare, he blew out the candle, bent down and caught up the child in his arms. He carried her to the big bedroom. He laid her on the bed and pulled the covers up around her. Apart from this, he lay down beside her.
          </p>
<p>
           After some time, still half asleep, she crept close to him, snuggled her head under his arm and held tightly to his shirt. Now she felt comfortable.
          </p>
<p>
           Her father told her to rub her feet against his legs and get them warm.
          </p>
<p>
           Now, Kezia realised that her father was not as harsh as she thought. She realised that her father had to work all day long and got so tired that he could not play with her. She realised that her father wanted her to understand his compulsion. At bottom, he was a very good person.

<strong>
            I. Look at the following sentence.
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           There was a glad sense of relief when she heard the noise of the carriage growing fainter…
          </p>
<p>
           Here, glad means happy about something. Glad, happy, pleased, delighted, thrilled and overjoyed are synonyms (words or expressions that have the same or nearly the same meaning.) However, they express happiness in certain ways.
          </p>
<p>
           Read the sentences below:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            She was glad when the meeting was over.
           </li>
<li>
            The chief guest was pleased to announce the name of the winner.
           </li>
</ul>

            II. Verbs of Reporting
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           Study the following sentences.
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            “What! ” screamed Mother.
           </li>
<li>
            “N-n-no”, she whispered.
           </li>
<li>
            “Sit up”, he ordered.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           The italicised words are verbs of reporting. We quote or report what someone has said or thought by using a reporting verb. Every reporting clause contains a reporting verb. For example:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            He promised to help in my project.
           </li>
<li>
            “How are you doing?” Seema asked. We use verbs of reporting to advise, order, report statements, thoughts, intentions, questions, requests, apologise, manner of speaking and so on.
           </li>
</ul>

<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           This story is not an Indian story. But do you think there are fathers, mothers and grandmothers like the ones portrayed in the story in our own country?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           There is no doubt that the Indian families too have such fathers, mothers and grandmothers. In this world of cut-throat competition everyone aspires for success. So, the parents (father and mother) get employed to provide the children with all the worldly comforts. But they fail to comprehend the psychology of the tiny tots and make them feel isolated. Children need parents’ time and love. They want that then- parents should interact with them humbly and without hurting their feelings.

<br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Kezia’s father was not right to punish her. He should have understood that she was only a child and a child tends to make mistakes. A child’s mistake should always be mended.
          </p>
<p>
           On the one hand, he was strict, unkind and short tempered. On the other hand, he was hard-working, responsible and caring to his family. He worked hard all day long and got tired. So, he was compelled not to give any time to Kezia. At heart he cared and loved Kezia very much. When she got frightened due to a nightmare, he immediately came to her with a candle to know what had happened to her. It shows that he cared her very much.

           Has your life been different from or similar to that of Kezia when you were a child? Has your perception about your parents changed now? Do you find any change in your parents ’ behaviour vis-a-vis yours? Who has become more understanding? What steps would you like to take to build a relationship based on understanding? Write three or four paragraphs (150-200 words) discussing these issues from your own experience.

<br/>
           Answer:
