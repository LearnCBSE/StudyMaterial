<li>
            It attracts iron pieces towards itself.
           </li>
<li>
            It always aligns itself in the same direction, if left to rotate freely.
           </li>
<li>
            It is composed of oxides of iron (Fe
            <sub>
             3
            </sub>
            O
            <sub>
             4
            </sub>
            ).
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Question 8.
           <br/>
           What are soft and hard magnetic materials?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Soft iron is called soft magnetic material because it loses its magnetism easily. Soft iron is used in making electromagnets. Steel is called a â€˜hardâ€™ magnetic material because it does not lose its magnetism so easily. It is used to make permanent magnets.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 9.
           <br/>
           How will you test that â€˜tea dust3 is not adulterated with iron powder?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           We will test that â€˜tea dustâ€™ is not adulterated with iron powder by using magnet. If it has iron powder they will stick onto the magnet.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Four identical iron bars were dipped in a heap of iron filings one by one. Fig. shows the amount of iron filings sticking to each of them.

            Poles of Magnet Class 6 Extra Questions
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Fill in the blanks:
           <br/>
           1. When a suspended magnet comes to rest, one pole always points towards the ______
           <br/>
           2.Â  And the other pole always points towards the ______
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            North
           </li>
<li>
            South
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           How many poles are there in a magnet?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           There are two poles in a magnet, north-pole and south-pole.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           To which part of the magnet do the most of the iron filings (or pins) stick?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Most of the iron filings (or pins) stick to the poles, i.e., north and south poles. At these poles of magnet, magnetic effect is maximum.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           To which part of the magnet do none or only a few iron filings (or pins) stick?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Minimum number of iron filings stick to the middle part of the magnet. Magnet has its magnetic effect least in this part (middle part).
          </p>
<p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Are both poles of a magnet similar?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           No, the two poles of a magnet are not similar (alike). Both have different tendency. The pole that points towards the north is called north-pole while the pole pointing always towards the south is called south-pole.
          </p>

<p>
           Question 6.
           <br/>
           Which is the north-pole of a bar magnet?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           It is the tip of a bar magnet which points towards the north direction.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 7.
           <br/>
           Which is the south-pole of a bar magnet?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           It is the tip of a bar magnet that points towards the south direction.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 8.
           <br/>
           Why does a freely suspended magnet always rest in north-south direction ?
           <br/>
           Answer: A freely suspended magnet always rest in north-south direction because the north-pole of the magnet lies in the geographic north direction and the south pole of the magnet lies in the geographic south direction. So it aligns itself in N-S direction.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Can we isolate north-pole or south-pole?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           No, we cannot isolate north- pole of a magnet from its south-pole or vice versa. If you break a bar magnet into two halves, you will not get a single north or south pole but two magnets each with its north and south-poles.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 10.
           <br/>
           What happens when a pole of a bar magnet say its north-pole is marked with a chalk and suspended freely? What do you observe on rotating the bar magnet?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The marked pole comes to rest in north direction. On rotating, after some time, it again comes to rest in north direction.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 11.
           <br/>
           Do magnetic poles exist separately like charges? Explain.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Magnetic poles do not exist separately like positive and negative charges. This means that it is not possible to isolate a north pole of a magnet from its south pole by cutting the magnet from the middle. Whenever a bar magnet is cut into two halves, we get two new magnets, each with its north and south poles. This will continue indefinitely even if extremely small pieces of bar magnets are obtained. Thus magnetic poles always exist in pairs.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 12.
           <br/>
           Where are the poles of a ring magnet? How will you find this?

<br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Ring type or circular magnet also has two poles. Its exterior and interior parts act like different poles.
           <br/>
           To find out the nature of the two poles, we suspend circular magnet with a piece of thread. We bring another magnet near it. Both attract each other. It clearly concludes that one surface of the circular magnet is attracted but the other surface is repelled by the same pole of the other magnet.
          </p>

           Question 15
           <br/>
           1. A toy car has a bar magnet laid hidden inside its body along its length. Using another magnet how will you find out which pole of the magnet is facing the front of the car?
           <br/>
           2. You are provided with two identical metal bars. One out of the two is a magnet. Suggest two ways to identify the magnet.
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            If the front of the toy car gets attracted to the north pole of the given magnet then it is the south pole of the bar magnet hidden inside the car. On the other hand, if it repels, then itÂ  has a north pole in front.
           </li>
<li>
            Two ways to identify the magnet are:
            <ul>
<li>
              By suspending the metal bars
             </li>
<li>
              By attracting iron filings.

            Finding Directions Class 6 Extra Questions
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           In which direction does freely suspended magnet rest?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A freely suspended magnet always points in the north-south direction.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           How do the shipmen find the direction even when north pointing pole star is not visible?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Shipmen during navigation can find the â€œdirection with the help of magnetic needle.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Why is compass needle kept in a closed glass vessel?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Compass needle is a small and thin magnet used to find the direction. If it is kept in open, it may deflect in any direction due to pressure exerted by air. So to know right direction, it is kept covered by glass covering.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Does the compass needle point in different directions?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The compass needle has a magnetic needle closed in a glass covering. The needle can rotate on its pin pointed base. Its red marked end always indicates towards the north direction. It always rests in north-south directions. We use it to find out the direction.
          </p>

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The direction of bar magnet is not changed as we rotate the stand. It is because a freely suspended magnet comes to rest in particular direction, i.e., north-south directions.

<p>
           Question 7.
           <br/>
           How can you show that unlike poles attract each other while like poles repel each other?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Suspend a magnet on a stand with the help of a string. Now it rests in N-S directions. Take another magnet which has been marked NTS on it and bring N-pole of this magnet near the N-pole of the suspended magnet. You will find that the suspended magnet rotates and moves away showing that like poles repel each other. The same can be repeated by bringing south-pole of one magnet near south-pole of suspended magnet.
          </p>
<p>
           Now you must have found that during the above experiment, south-pole comes towards north-pole and vice versa. It can be repeated by bringing south-pole near a north-pole and north-pole near south-pole of suspended magnet. You will find that unlike poles attract each other.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 8.
           <br/>
           Bhawana witnessed an interesting game at the fair. A duck was floating in a tub. When a plate containing some grains of rice was brought close to the duck, the duck moved towards the plate. But, when a plate containing some pebbles was brought close to; the duck, it moved away from the plate. Explain how this could have been possible.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           This game is based on the plate containing rice which may have magnet attached to its bottom. The magnet is fitted in such a way that its north-pole points towards rice grains, while south- pole indicates towards pebbles. A magnet (bar magnet) may also be fitted in the bottom of the duck, where south-pole points towards mouth and north-pole towards tail of the duck.
          </p>
<p>
           When the rice portion of the plate is brought closer to the duck, the duck moves towards rice grains because unlike poles of two magnets attract each other. In second situation, same (like) poles repel each other. So the duck moves away.

           <br/>
           What are the precautions need to be taken while handling a magnet
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When heated, hammered or dropped from a height, magnets tend to lose their properties. They become weak if they are not stored properly and hence:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Bar magnets should be stored in pairs separated by a small block of wood and their unlike poles facing the same side with a soft iron across their ends.
           </li>
<li>
            A piece of iron should be kept across the poles in case of a horse shoe magnet.
           </li>
<li>
            Magnets should be kept away from computers, mobiles, televisions etc.
           </li>
<li>
            Magnets should be handled with care and they should be stored properly.
           </li>
</ul>
