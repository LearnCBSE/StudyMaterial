           Answer:
           <br/>
           Dispersed Rural Settlement : Dispersed rural settlements are those in which houses are built far apart from each other. These settlements consist of one or two houses and cultural features such as a church or a temple binds the settlement together. Such settlements are found over hills, plateau and highlands. The reasons for the development of such settlements in India are :
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Extremely fragmented nature of the terrain and land resource of habitable areas.
           </li>
<li>
            Safety of people who have to travel a long distance for basic commodities are threatened because of isolation that is why, this settlement is preferred.

           Question 17.
           <br/>
           “The distribution of roads in India is not uniform”. Examine the statement giving three reasons. [3 × 1 = 3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Distribution of road is not uniform in India due to different types of geographical features. Moreover, the volume of traffic as well as passengers also affects road networking in India. Roads become narrow and congested with broken culverts and bridges. Some roads are metalled that are well built with brick and cement whereas some are unmetalled especially in rural areas which become inaccessible during rainy seasons. The regions with rugged terrain have steep roads with many hairpin bends. For ununiformed distribution, there are certain reasons :
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Construction of roads is costlier in mountains, valleys and plateau region than plain region.
           </li>
<li>
            Less population also affects construction of roads. Deserts interior most parts of the country do not require large number of roads, hence have lesser number of roads.
           </li>
<li>
            The ratio of rivers, canals and other such geographical forms are higher in India. It works as a barrier in constructing roads.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Question 18.
           <br/>
           “Most of India’s foreign trade is carried through sea routes”. Explain the statement giving three reasons. [3 × 1 = 3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Port plays an important role in the growth of manufacturing and mining sector. Core manufacturing sector like steel, refinery and automobiles are dependent on trade for raw materials and sale of finished products. Logistics cost plays an important role in the cost of production and hence profitability of the business as volumes of material to be transported are huge. The 12 state-owned ports (Kolkata, Paradip, Vishakhapatnam, Ennore, Chennai, Tuticorin, Kochi, New Mangalore, Mormugao, Kandla, Mumbai and Navi Mumbai) which look after about 58 per cent of India’s external trade by volume shipped by sea. With rising demand for port infrastructure due to growing imports (crude, coal) and containerization, it will be difficult for public ports to meet demand. This provides private ports with an opportunity to serve the spill-off demand from major ports and increase their capacities in line with forecasted new demand.

           Question 19.
           <br/>
           Describe any three major problems of slums in India. [3 × 1 = 3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The three problems faced by slum dwellers in India are :
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            The areas in which they live (dilapidated houses) are overcrowded having narrow street pattern prone to serious hazards from fire.
           </li>
<li>
            Lack of basic amenities like drinking water, light, and toilet facilities. They are also faced by poor ventilation, and poor hygienic conditions.
           </li>
<li>
            These slums in the nearby areas breed because of pollution and thus their existence results in health hazards. Since they have no place to bathe, go to the toilet, wash their clothes, so all this daily work is done in the open causing inconvenience to the residents of the areas.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Question 20.
           <br/>

<p>
           Question 21.
           <br/>
           Explain any five characteristics of ‘extensive commercial grain cultivation’ practised in the world. [5 × 1 = 5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Extensive commercial farming is a system of agriculture in which relatively small amounts of capital or labour investment are applied to relatively large areas of land. At times, the land is left fallow to regain its fertility.
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            This commercial grain cultivation is practiced in the interior parts of semi-arid lands of the mid-latitudes.
           </li>
<li>
            The size of the farm is very large, therefore entire operations of cultivation from ploughing to harvesting are mechanized.
           </li>
<li>
            There is low yield per acre but high yield per person.
           </li>
<li>
            It usually occurs at the margin of the agricultural system, at a great distance from market or on poor land of limited potential and is usually practiced in the tarai regions of Southern Nepal.
           </li>
<li>
            Wheat is the principal crop, though other crops like corn, barley, oats and rye are also grown.
           </li>
</ol>

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Manufacturing is the production of merchandise for use or sale using labour and machines, tools, chemical ari3 biological processing, or formulation. The term may refer to a range of human activities, from handicrafts to high technology but is most commonly applied to industrial production. Features of small manufacturing are :
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Simple power driver machines are used.
           </li>
<li>
            The manufacturing of products is based upon the raw material available in that area.
           </li>
<li>
            Semi-skilled and un-skilled labours are used.
           </li>
<li>
            It raises local purchasing power.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Question 23.
           <br/>
           Why are ports known as ‘gateways’ of international trade ? Explain any three characteristics of inland ports. [2 + 3 = 5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Ports are known as gateways of international trade because cargoes and travelers pass from one part of the world to another through these ports. The ports provide facilities of docking, loading, unloading and the storage facilities for cargo. Port authorities make arrangements for maintaining navigable channels, arranging tugs, and barges, and providing labour and managerial services. The importance of port is judged by the size of cargo and the number of ships handled.
           <br/>
           Characteristics of inland ports :
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            These ports are located away from the sea coast.
           </li>
<li>
            They are linked to the sea through a river or a canal.
           </li>
<li>
            Such ports are accessible to flat bottom ships or barges.
            <br/>
            eg. Manchester is linked with a canal.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Phine has several ports like Mannheim, Duisburg.
           <br/>
           Kolkata is located on the river Hooghly, a branch of river Ganga.
          </p>

           Question 24.
           <br/>
           Explain any five major problems of the rural settlements in the developing countries of the world. [5 × 1 = 5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Problems of rural settlements in the developing countries of the world are :
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Supply of water to rural settlements in developing countries is not adequate. People in villages, particularly in mountainous and arid areas have to walk long distances to fetch drinking water.
           </li>
<li>
            Water-borne diseases such as Cholera and Jaundice are common problems because of lack of safe drinking water and unhygienic conditions.
           </li>
<li>
            Villages are adversely affected by the conditions of drought and flood. This in turn, affects the crop cultivation.
           </li>
<li>
            Unmetalled roads and lack of modern communication network causes difficulties in providing emergency services during floods.
           </li>
<li>
            It is also difficult to provide adequate health and educational infrastructure for large rural population. The problem is particularly serious where houses are scattered over a large area.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Question 25.
           <br/>
           Analyse any five major problems of Indian agriculture. [5 × 1 = 5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The major problems of Indian agriculture are :
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Dependency on monsoon due to insufficient irrigation system is major drawbacks of Indian agriculture system.
           </li>
<li>
            The yield of crops in India is very low. Less productive seeds are used for agriculture instead of hybrid seeds.
           </li>
<li>
            Poor economic system and insuffcient infra-structural developments of Indian villages also work as a barrier for agricultural development in India.
           </li>
<li>
            The employment of scientific technique, especially in America and Russia, has achieved tremendous progress. In the first place, machines have superseded manual labour. That means a larger acreage is brought under cultivation in more effcient manner. ,
           </li>
<li>
            All this needs far-sighted planning. When the determined efforts are made to modernize their ownership of land is restored to the cultivators, and outlook, agriculture in India will fourish much more.
           </li>
</ol>

           [11/2 + 11/2 = 3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In India, people migrate from rural to urban areas mainly due to poverty, high population pressure on the land, lack of basic infrastructural facilities like health care, education, etc. Work and employment are the main causes for male migration (38%) while it is only 3% for the females. Contrary to this, about 65% of females move out from their parental houses after their marriage. This is the most important cause in the rural area of India.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Mixed farming is an agrarian system that mixes arable farming with the raising of livestock. When on a farm along with crop production, some other agriculture based practices like poultry, dairy farming or bee keeping etc., are adopted, and then this system of farming is known as mixed farming. It is dominant system in Europe, where most farms have a mixture of fields and pastures. Some characteristics are :
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            It offers highest return on farm business, as the by-products of farm are properly utilized.
           </li>
<li>
            It provides work throughout the year.
           </li>
<li>
            Efficient utilization of land, labour, equipment and other resources.
           </li>
<li>
            The crop by products such as straw, forage, fodder etc., is used for feeding of livestock and in return they provide milk and other products.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Cropping intensity means that a higher portion of the net area is being cropped more than once during one agricultural year. This also implies higher productivity per unit of arable land during one agricultural year.
           <br/>
           Cropping seasons in India :

           Question 25.
           <br/>
           Define the term ‘Net Sown Area’. Explain any two characteristics each of ‘dry land farming’ and ‘wetland farming’. [1 + 2 + 2 = 5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The physical extent of land on which crops are sown and harvested is known as net sown area. It represents the total area sown with crops. Area shown more than once in the same year is counted only once.
          </p>
<p>
           On the basis of adequacy of soil moisture during the cropping season the farming is divided into two categories i.e., dry land farming and wetland farming.
          </p>
<p>
           Characteristics of ‘dry land farming’:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            It is largely confined to the regions having annual rainfall less than 75 cm.
           </li>
<li>
            These regions grow hardly drought resistant crops such as ragi, bajra, moong, gram and guar.
           </li>
<li>
            It uses various soil moisture conservation and rainwater harvesting techniques.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Characteristics of ‘wetland farming’:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            It is largely confined to the regions where rainfall is in excess of the soil moisture requirement of plant during rainy season.
           </li>
<li>
            Such regions may face flood and soil erosion hazards.
           </li>
<li>
            These areas grow various water intensive crops such as rice, jute, and sugarcane and practice aquaculture in the fresh water bodies.
           </li>
</ol>
