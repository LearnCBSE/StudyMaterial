           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Answer the following questions:
           <br/>
           (a) ”… But up-and-down brushin’
           <br/>
           And pokin’ and fussin’
           <br/>
           Didn’t seem worth the time—I could bite!” What do these lines convey?
           <br/>
           (b) Why did the poet go to the dentist? How could she have avoided it?
           <br/>
           (c) “If you got a tooth, you got a friend”, what do you understand from the line?
           <br/>
           (d) With reference to the poem, how can you look after your teeth?
           <br/>
           (e) Give an appropriate proverb that conveys the message that this poem carries.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The act of brushing her teeth up and down and checking them carefully didn’t help her much. It was too little and too late. Most of the time she hajl been biting lollies, toffees, sweets and candies. And that had already done the damage.
           <br/>
           (b) The poet went to the dentist for fillings and drilling. She lay in the chair of an old dentist who was drilling into her teeth with his machine. She could have avoided all these if she had taken proper care of her teeth.
           <br/>
           (c) ‘If you got a tooth, you got a friend’ expresses a practical truth of life. Without healthy teeth you can’t chew and eat things properly. Good teeth are your good friends. They keep your taste and digestion all right.
           <br/>
           (d) The poem gives us a definite message. We should not neglect our teeth but take a proper care of them. We should not eat toffees, lollies, candies and sweets. If we don’t care, it means we are paving the way for cavities, caps and decay.
           <br/>
           (e) Make hay while the sun shines.
          </p>

           Question 6.
           <br/>
           Listen to the conversation between Doki and his sister, Moki. As you listen complete the idioms and expressions listed below:
           <br/>
           1. sleep ……………….
           <br/>
           2 ………………. me the willies
           <br/>
           3. crack the ………………
           <br/>
           4. take the …………….. to water
           <br/>
           5. ……………tail.
           <br/>
           6. wonders will …………….
           <br/>
           7. ……………… can’t be undone.
           <br/>
           8. reap what I …………….
           <br/>
           Idioms are metaphorical expressions rather than literal. For example ‘give someone the willies’ does not simply mean ‘to hand over something called willies to someone’, but ‘to make someone feel nervous’. It is important for learners of English to understand them and be able to use them.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           1. sleep like a log. (sleep very well)
           <br/>
           2. unwanted guests give me the willies (make me nervous)
           <br/>
           3. crack the whip (use your authority)
           <br/>
           4. take the well to water (do the opposite)
           <br/>
           5. I know neither its head nor its tail (know nothing about it)
           <br/>
           6. Wonders will never cease (wonders will continue to happen)
           <br/>
           7. What has been done, can’t be undone (can’t be changed)
           <br/>
           8. Reap what I sow. (bad result of what you did in the past)

           “I can’t afford to, after what Jack s done to his teeth. ”

           The poet feels that she was not wise enough to look after her teeth. She used her only shilling to buy hard sweets and candies like gobstoppers which she cut with all respect with her knife. She should have used her shilling for buying something that was good for teeth rather than buying gobstoppers. She should have taken all these precautions when she had many more healthy teeth than the ‘filled’ ones.

           The poet says that she did brush her teeth properly. She even tried to make them shining even late at night. But these up and down actions of the tooth-brush and her checking them carefully didn’t produce the desired results. The time that she spent on all these things was much less and not worthwhile than the time she spent on eating sweets and licking lollies and candies.

           जब मेरी माँ अपने नकली दाँतों को झाग वाले पानी में रखती थी, तो मैं उसकी हँसी उड़ाती थी। लेकिन अब हिसाब-किताब तय करने का समय आ चुका है और माँ के वे नकली दाँत मेरी ओर इशारा कर रहे हैं। ओह अफ़सोस, मैंने अपने दाँतों का ख्याल रखा होता।

            Paraphrase:
           </strong>
           When the poet’s mother put her false teeth in the foam, she just laughed at her and her false teeth. But now the time of reckoning has come. Those false teeth of the mother remind her that it is her turn now. The poet regrets that she neglected her teeth and wishes she’d looked after them.

             ABOUT THE POEM
            </strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>
           The poem conveys the necessity of taking care of teeth in one’s childhood. The poet regrets that she did not take care of her teeth during her childhood. So she developed many cavities beneath her teeth. She harmed her teeth by eating a lot of toffees, sweet and sticky food. Now she realizes that she should not have eaten those lollies, candies and tiny sweets. She feels guilty on thinking about her bad habits. To make the matter worse, she did not brush her teeth properly. Now she had to go to the dentist for treatment. She had to bear the pain of injection and of the dentist’s drill. When she sat in the dentist’s chair, she became desperate. When she looked at the false teeth of her mother she reminded herself to be careful otherwise she would also have to get false teeth.

</strong>
<br/>
           The poem repeats the line ‘Oh, I wish I’d looked after me teeth’ to emphasise the necessity of dental hygiene. She repeatedly expresses her regret and tells the reader how she had harmed her teeth by eating many sweets and by the neglect of her teeth. Thus, the poem succeeds in its explicit aim of making the reader aware of the significance of dental care.

</strong>
<br/>
           The dentist is using his drill- which gives the sound of whining-in filling the holes in the teeth of the poet. It is so because there are cavities beneath the poet’s teeth, caused by her neglect of her teeth.

           The poet should have spent her money on the right kind of food. She should have spent money on healthy and nutritious food that would have made her teeth strong and healthy. She should not have wasted money on buying toffees, lollies, candies and sweet, sticky food.

<br/>
           The conscience of the poet pricks her because she had been eating wrong kind of food. She had been eating toffees, lollies and candies and sweet, sticky food. This kind of food caused cavities in her teeth. She had to bear painful injections and the pain of the dentist’s drill. Thus, she feels guilty.

</strong>
<br/>
           Her mother’s false teeth gave her the signal that if she did not take care of her teeth, she, too, would have to get the false teeth for herself. She had neglected the care of her teeth. She developed many cavities in her teeth. She was likely to lose some teeth. So she thought that her mother’s false teeth gave a sort of warning to her.

           In the poem ‘Oh ! I Wish I’d Looked After Me Teeth’ the poet paid no attention to her teeth in her childhood. She continued to eat sweets and sticky stuff. To make the matters worse, she did not brush her teeth carefully. She thought that brushing was a useless activity. The result was that many cavities developed beneath her teeth. She had to go to the dentist to fill those holes. She suffered from a lot of needless pain. Had she treated her teeth with respect she would not have to suffer at all.

            </span>
</strong>
<br/>
           The poet regrets that she had not taken care of her teeth during her childhood. She conveys a message to the children that they should inculcate in themselves a good sense of dental hygiene. She regrets that she harmed her teeth by
           <sup>
            ;
           </sup>
           neglecting their care. Due to the neglect of her teeth, she developed many cavities beneath her teeth. It happened because she had been eating a lot of toffees and sweet, sticky food. Now, she realizes that she should not have eaten sweets and hard candies. She feels guilty that she had been eating
           <br/>
           lollies, candies and tiny sweets. Her conscience pricks her because she had been eating wrong food. The poet regrets that she did not brush her teeth properly. She did not brush her teeth by moving brush up and down. She did not consider it worthwhile to spend some time in cleaning her teeth. Consequently, the poet had to go to the dentist for treatment.

</strong>
<br/>
           What is the role of parents and teachers in teaching dental care to children ? Discuss it with reference to the poet’s experience in the poem ‘Oh ! I Wish I’d Looked After Me Teeth’.

<span style="color: #008000;">
             Answer:
            </span>
</strong>
<br/>
           There is no denying the fact that parents and teachers can play an active role in teaching dental hygiene to children. Mothers at home must ensure that her children do not eat too many sweets. She should ensure that they brush their teeth at least twice a day. She should also tell them the proper use of toothbrush. If the children pay no or little attention to their teeth, they should be taken to the dentist and show the horrible scene of treating the teeth.
           <br/>
           In the poem ‘Oh ! I Wish I’d Looked After Me Teeth’, it seems as if her parents were quite negligent. They did not persuade or force her to avoid sweets and brush her teeth carefully. Had they played their role well the poet would not have to suffer a lot of pain at the dentist in filling her cavities.
