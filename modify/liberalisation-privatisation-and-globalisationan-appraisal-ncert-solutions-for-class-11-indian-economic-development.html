<p>
<strong>
            Question 1. Why were reforms introduced in India?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           In 1991, economic reforms were introduced in India because 1991 was the year of crisis for the Indian economy. It is clear from the following facts:
           <br/>
           (a) National income was growing at the rate of 0.8%.
           <br/>
           (b) Inflation reached the height of 16.8%.
           <br/>
           (c) Balance of payment crisis was to the extent of 10,000 crores.
           <br/>
           (a) India was highly indebted country. It was paying 30,000 crores interest charges per year.
           <br/>
           (e) Foreign exchanges reserves were only 1.8 billion dollars which were sufficient for three weeks.
           <br/>
           (f) India sold large amount of gold to Bank of England.
           <br/>
           (g) India applied for the loan from World Bank and IMF to the extent of 7 billion dollars.
           <br/>
           (h) Fiscal deficit was more than 7.5%.
           <br/>
           (i) Deficit financing was around 3%.
           <br/>
           (j) Trade relation with Soviet block had broken down.
           <br/>
           (k) Remmittances from non-residence Indians stopped due to war in Arab countries.
           <br/>
           (l) Price of petroleum products was very high.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            Question 2. How many countries are members of the WTO?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           At present there are 149 countries which are members of WTO.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            Question 3. What is the most important function of RBI?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           There was a substantial shift in role of the RBI from ‘a regulator’ to ‘a facilitator’ of the financial sector. Earlier as a regulator, the RBI would itself fix interest rate structure for the commercial banks. After liberalisation in 1991, RBI as a facilitator would only facilitate free play of the market forces and leave it to the commercial banks to decide their interest rate structure. Thus, with liberalisation competition prevails rather than controls.

<strong>
            Question 4. How was RBI controlling the commercial banks?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Prior to 1991, banking institutions were subject to too much control by the RBI through high bank rate, high cash reserve ratio and statutory liquidity ratio.
           <br/>
           Financial sector includes:
           <br/>
           (a) banking and non-banking financial’institutions,
           <br/>
           (b) stock exchange market, and
           <br/>
           (c) foreign exchange market.
           <br/>
           In India, financial sector is regulated and controlled by the RBI (Reserve Bank of India).
           <br/>

            Question 14. Agriculture sector appears to be adversely affected by the reform process. Why?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           There has been deceleration in agricultural growth. This deceleration is the root cause of the problem of rural distress that reached crisis in some parts of the country. Farmers find themselves into crippling debt due to low farm incomes combined with low prices of output and lack of credit at reasonable prices. This has led to widespread distress migration.
           <br/>
           Economic reforms have not been able to benefit the agricultural sector because:
           <br/>
           (a) Liberalisation has forced the small farmers to compete in a global market where prices of goods have fallen while removal of subsidies has led to increase in the cost of production. It has made farming more expensive.
           <br/>
           (b) Various policy changes like reduction in import duties on agricultural products, removal of minimum support price and lifting of quantitative restrictions have increased the threat of international competition to the Indian farmers.
           <br/>
           (c) The export-oriented growth has favoured increased production of cash crops rather than food grains. This has increased the prices of food grains.
           <br/>
           (d) Public investment in agriculture sector especially in infrastructure which includes irrigation, power, roads, market linkages and research has been reduced in the reform period.

<strong>
            Question 15. Why has the industrial sector performed poorly in the reform period?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           The post-reform period shows that industrial growth has slowed down. This was due to:
           <br/>
           (a) Globalisation created conditions for free movement of goods and services from foreign countries. It adversely affected the local industries and employment in developing countries.
           <br/>
           (b) Globalisation led to decrease in demand for domestic industrial products due to cheaper imports.
           <br/>
           (c) There was inadequate investment in infrastructural facilities such as power supply.
           <br/>
           (d) A development country like India still does not have the access to markets of developed countries due to high non-tariff barriers.

<strong>
            Question 16. Discuss economic reforms in India in the light of social justice and welfare.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Economic reforms have been criticised on the following grounds:
           <br/>
           (a) Privatisation encourages growth-ofunonopoly power in the hands of big business houses. It results in greater inequalities of income and wealth.
           <br/>
           (b) Globalisation has devastated local producers since they are unable to compete with cheap imports.
           <br/>
           (c) Economic reforms have led to mounting workers unrest. Workers have protested against low wages, poor working conditions, autocratic management rule, long work days and fall in social benefits.
           <br/>
           (d) These have made public employees worse off. Public employees are adversely effected by budget cuts, privatisation and massive loss of purchasing power.
           <br/>
           (e) Small business class is adversely affected by fall of public subsidies, de-industrialisation and floods of cheap imports.
           <br/>
           (f) During the globalisation phase, about half a billion people in South Asia have experienced a decline in their income. Data shows that it is the poor who have suffered most.
           <br/>
           (g) Since the government is unable to help the victims of globalisation, the provisions of social safety net have been weakened.
           <br/>
           (h) The global village appears deeply divided between the street of the haves and those of the havenots. The average person in Norway (which has highest human development) and the average person in countries such as Niger (which has lowest human development) certainly live in different human development districts of the global village.
