<br/>
<span style="color: #339966;">
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
             Answer:
            </strong>
</span>
           Bangladesh has been the part of Pakistan itself. Both of these countries bear some similarities and differences as follows:
           <br/>
           Commonalities
           <br/>
           1. Both Bangladesh and Pakistan were under a military rule.
           <br/>
           2. At both the places, the struggle for democracy took place in their own way.
           <br/>
           3. Pakistan’s administration began under the command of General Ayub Khan and gave up due to dissatisfaction among people giving way to Yahya’s military rule and continued with the army rule though elections were held by military rulers to give a democratic shape to their own rule.
           <br/>
           4. In the same way, Bangladesh drafted its own constitution to begin with democracy. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman formed presidential setup by abolishing all the parties except Awami Legue. But after his assassination the new military ruler Zia-ur-Rahman formed his own party and won elections in 1979. Later on he was also assassinated and another military leader Lt. Gen. H.M. Ershad took over. Differences
           <br/>
           1. In Pakistan, military, clergy and land-owning aristocrats dominated socially to overthrow elected government whereas in Bangladesh the leaders and their party members dominated for the same.
           <br/>
           2. Pro-military groups have become more powerful due to conflict with India in Pakistan whereas in Bangladesh, pro-military groups are powerful due to friendship and encouragement of India.
          </p>
<p>
<span style="color: #993366;">
<strong>
             4. List three challenges to democracy in Nepal.
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #339966;">
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
             Answer:
            </strong>
</span>
           The three challenges to democracy in Nepal were the result of a triangular conflict between-
           <br/>
           1. the monarchist forces
           <br/>
           2. the democrats
           <br/>
           3. the Maoists
           <br/>
           These challenges created massive, countrywide, pro-democracy protest in April 2006.
          </p>
<p>
<span style="color: #993366;">
<strong>
             5. Name the principal players in the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka. How do you assess the prospects of the resolution of this conflict?
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #339966;">
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
             Answer:
            </strong>
</span>
           The principal players in the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka were Sinhala and Sri Lankan Tamils.
           <br/>
           After its independence, politics in Sri Lanka was dominated by the interests of Sinhala community who was hostile to Tamils, who migrated from India to be settled there. Sinhalese presumed Sri Lanka to be belonged to them only, hence no concession should be given to Tamils. This created militant Tamil nationalism
           <br/>
           i. e. ‘Ethnic conflict’.
           <br/>
           Despite the revenges of internal conflict Sri Lanka has maintained democratic political system and registered considerable economic growth and high level of human development.

<strong>
             6. Mention some of the recent agreements between India and Pakistan. Can we be sure that the two countries are well in their way to a friendly relationship?
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #339966;">
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
             Answer:
            </strong>
</span>
           Although Indo-Pakistan relations seem to be the story of endemic conflict and violence, there have been a series of efforts to manage tensions and build peace under the various agreements:
           <br/>
           1. Agreed to undertake confidence building measures to reduce the risk of war.
           <br/>
           2. Social activists and prominent personalities have collaborated to create an atmosphere of friendship.
           <br/>
           3. Leaders have met at summits to better understanding.
           <br/>
           4. Bus routes have been opened up between these two countries.
           <br/>
           5. Trade between the two parts of Punjab has increased substantially in the last five years.
           <br/>
           6. Visas have been given more easily. No, despite the above mentioned agreements and initiatives, we can not be sure that both the countries are well in their way to friendship, still some areas of conflict exist there to be sorted out,
          </p>

</span>
           The external powers influence bilateral relations in South Asia because no region exists in the vacuum. It is influenced by outside powers and events no matter how much it may try to insulate itself from non-regional powers:
           <br/>
           1. China and the US remain key players in South Asian politics.
           <br/>
           2. Sino-Indian relations have improved significantly in the last ten years, but China’s strategic partnership with Pakistan remains a major irritant.
           <br/>
           3. The demands of development and globalisation have brought the two Asian giants closer and their economic ties have multiplied rapidly since 1991.
           <br/>
           4. The US enjoys good relations with both India and Pakistan and works as a moderator in Indo-Pak relations.
           <br/>
           5. Economic reforms and liberal economic policies in both the countries have increased the depth of American participation. . _
           <br/>
           6. The large South Asian economy remains in the US and the huge size of population and markets of the region give America an added stake in the future of regional security and peace.

             Answer:
            </strong>
</span>
           Role of SAARC: Role of SAARC can be identified as follows:
           <br/>
           1. ‘South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation’ (SAARC) is a regional initiative among South Asian states to evolve cooperation since 1985 onwards.
           <br/>
           2. It consists of seven members to encourage mutual harmony and understanding.
           <br/>
           3. SAARC has initiated SAFTA (South Asian Free Trade Agreement) to free trade zones for wThole south Asia for collective economic security.
           <br/>
           4. SAARC has projected on economic development of its member states to reduce their dependencies on the non-regional powers.
           <br/>
           Limitations: SAARC is growing slowly due to political differences among its member states—
           <br/>
           1. Only the conflicts led to bilateral issues as Kashmir problem between India and Pak.
           <br/>
           2. Some of the India’s neighbours fear that India intends to dominate them by influencing their societies and politics.
           <br/>
           3. SAARC members are from among the developing or least developing countries which creates insufficiency of funds.
          </p>

<strong>

             Answer:
            </strong>
</span>
           No, the impression is not correct because India makes efforts to manage its neighbours beyond its size and powers which can be justified on following grounds-
           <br/>
           1. India often feels exploited by its neighbours.
           <br/>
           2. On the other hand, India’s neighbours fear that India wants to dominate them regionally but India is centrally located who shares borders with other countries geographically, which should be accepted on mutual understanding.
           <br/>
           3. India avoids political instability in its neighbouring states so that outsiders should not take advantage of influence in the region.

            Pakistan and Bangladesh have experienced both civilian and military rulers, with Bangladesh remaining democracy, in the Post Cold War period. Pakistan began the post cold war period with successive democratic governments under Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif respectively. But it suffered a military coup in 1999 and-has been run by a military regime since then. Till 2006, Nepal was a constitutional monarchy with the danger of the king taking over executive powers. In 2006, a successful uprising led to restoration of democracy and reduced the king to a nominal position, from the experience of Bangladesh and Nepal, we can say that democracy is becoming an accepted norm in the entire region of South Asia.

</span>
           Bangladesh was a part of Pakistan from 1947 to 1971. It consisted of the partitioned areas of Bengal and Assam from British India. The people of this region resented the domination of Western Pakistan and the imposition of Urdu language. Soon after the partition, they began protests against the unfair treatment meted out to the Bengali culture and language. They demanded autonomy for the eastern region. But the government dominated by the West Pakistan leadership refused their demand. The Pakistan army tried to suppress the mass movement of the Bengali people. Thousands were killed by the Pakistan army. This led a large scale migration into India, creating a huge refugee problem for India. The government of India supported the demand of the people of East Pakistan for their independence and helped them financially and militarily. This resulted in a war between India and Pakistan in December 1971 that ended in surrender of the Pakistan forces in East Pakistan and the formation of Bangladesh as an independent country.

           1. The lack of genuine international support for a democratic rule in Pakistan has encouraged to military to continue its dominance. The US and other countries have also supported military rule due to fulfilling their own interests.
           <br/>
           2. Pakistan’s conflict with India has made paramilitary groups more powerful which have often said that political parties and democracy in Pakistan are flawed, that Pakistan’s security would be harmed by selfish minded parties and chaotic democracy, hence army stay in power is justified.
           <br/>
           3. The social dominance of military, clergy, and owning aristocracy has led to frequent overthrow of elected governments and the establishing of military governments.
           <br/>
           4. Global Islamic Terrorism and their apprehension that Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal might fall into hands
           <br/>
           of these terrorist groups, the military regime in Pakistan was seen as the protector of western interests in West Asia and South Asia.
           <br/>
           The two pro-democracy factors present in Pakistan that can pave the way for establishing a lasting democratic set up over there are:
           <br/>
           1. Pakistan bears a courageous and entirely free press.
           <br/>
           2. Pakistan enjoys strong human rights movement.
