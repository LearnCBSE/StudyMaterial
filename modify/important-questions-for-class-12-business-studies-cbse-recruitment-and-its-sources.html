<strong>
            (i) Employment exchanges

The job seekers leave their bio-data with the employment exchanges and the organisations approaches the employment exchanges for suitable candidates. Thus, the employment exchanges bring the job givers in contact with the job seekers.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (ii) Campus recruitment
           </strong>

This type of recruitment is more common for engineers, computer programmers, MBAs, etc. Organisation prefers fresh graduates because they can be moulded according to the organisation’s requirement easily.

           <br/>
<strong>
            (i) Economical sources
           </strong>

            15. Which source of recruitment is needed to bring new blood in the organisation? Explain any three advantages and any two limitations of this source.
           </strong>
<strong>
            (HOTS; All India 2008)
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           External source of recruitment is needed to bring new blood in the organisation. It is preferred whenever large number of job positions are vacant. Under this, the organisation meets its manpower requirement from outside the organisation.
           <br/>
           The three advantages of external sources of recruitment are as follows:
           <br/>
<strong>
            (i) Fresh talent
           </strong>
           The entry of fresh talent into the organisation is encouraged. New employees bring new ideas to the organisation.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (ii) Latest technological knowledge
           </strong>
           Through campus placement, organisation can get employees with latest technical know-how.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (iii) Competitive spirit
           </strong>
           When outsiders join the organisation, this develops a competitive spirit in existing employees of the organisation.
           <br/>
           Limitations of external sources of recruitment are as follows: (Any two)
           <br/>
<strong>
            (i) Employees may not adjust according to the rules and regulations of the company
           </strong>
           The new employees may not adjust themselves as per the rules and regulations of the organisation which means more chances of employee turnover.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (ii) Costly
           </strong>
           It is expensive to invite the outsiders to apply for the vacant job positions. Companies have to bear heavy burden of advertising.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (iii) Time consuming
           </strong>
           It is a lengthy process as external recruitment takes more time.
