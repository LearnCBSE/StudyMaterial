<p>
           Sir
           <br/>
           Through the columns of your reputed newspaper, I wish to make the people aware of the growing need and demands of solar power. We all know that our earth is showing signs of a patient in declining health and it is due to excessive pollution on our planet. Man has a desire to live a luxurious life and for that, he is over consuming electricity. He doesn’t realize that overuse would exhaust the treasure. We must conserve electricity which is the need of the hour.
           <br/>
           But this com; rvation can only be done if we start using solar power systems. Various kinds of solar systems like solar cookers, solar lanterns, solar heating and cooking system, solar water heater, etc., are available in the market.
           <br/>
           These solar systems are non-polluting. They are economical and are available in different sizes. So, I request you to publish this letter in your newspaper to make people aware of the need of conserving electricity and limiting electricity bills. Public must pay attention to the dire need of switching over to solar energy.
           <br/>
           Thanking you.

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Though there is a movement like ‘Sarvashiksha Abhiyan’ and enrolling of underprivileged children in schools, there are still many children, like the one in the picture, who do not go to school, rather have never seen a school. It is indeed disturbing. You decide to write a letter to the editor of a newspaper expressing your views and the steps to be taken. Take ideas from the MCB unit ‘Education’. Write the letter in about 120 words. (NCT 2014) (5 marks)

<p>
           Sir
           <br/>
           Through the columns of your reputed newspaper, I wish to draw your attention towards the movement ‘Sarvashiksha Abhiyan’ which aims at providing knowledge to all children. Even the act RTE-Right to Education also ensures education for all children between the age of four to fourteen. But these movements and acts do not show themselves implemented anywhere especially in the underprivileged class. There are still many children who do not go to school. They either work as a domestic labour or work in factories, dhabas, etc. It is disturbing to note that our government’s plans are not bearing any fruits. It is all because of lack of awareness towards these kinds of movements.
           <br/>
           We all need the help of print media as well as electronic media to spread messages of awareness to the masses. The underprivileged children must be made to realize that they have the right to get education. So, they must go to school. The foremost thing is to discourage child-labour so as to give these children a bright future. I hope you will pay attention to this noble cause and publish it in your newspaper.
           <br/>
           Thanking you.

           Sir
           <br/>
           I wish to draw your attention towards the inflation which has made life difficult for common man. It was not so in earlier times when things were very cheap and were within the reach of almost everyone. But the sharp rise in prices of all commodities has made it difficult for a common man to make both his ends meet He cannot bear even the daily expenses of his family. This is giving rise to disappointments and dejections in their life. Corruption is also on the rise, so as to avoid financial crisis, people are turning towards bribery whidt is the root cause of all evils. The society is taking a bad turn only because of inflation.
           <br/>
           It is high time that the concerned authorities should wake up to this social cause and try to put reins to the rising price so that people can lead a comfortable and peaceful life.

           Sir
           <br/>
           Through this letter of mine, I wish to draw the attention of everyone towards the increased dependence of humans on technology. We use internet for any type of information which we find only a click away. Everyone, whether a child or an adult, wants gadgets like cell phones, I-pod, laptop, etc. No doubt, technology is a boon to mankind and has a great future ahead. But in my opinion, we should not depend on it as excess of everything is bad. It is making everyone lazy. On the other hand, cyber crimes are also growing. The key word for this is caution.
           <br/>
           We must make judicious use of technology and should not totally depend on it. We must believe in natural and simple living.
           <br/>
           I hope you will publish this letter in your newspaper for better future of human beings.

           Can you create functional, green spaces in a crowded city like Mumbai ? ‘Fresh and Local’ is an initiative to transform underused spaces into productive, community areas through urban farming. It aims to inspire city residents to make the most use of the spaces that surround them to grow fruits, herbs and vegetables. Not only can urban farming improve the environment, but also the health of the city residents.

           Kush decides to write a letter to the Editor of a National Daily to raise public awareness about using the space around them for productive community areas.

           Through the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I wish to draw the attention of the general public towards the underused spaces in crowded cities like Mumbai. These spaces can be best used by taking some initiative to make them green. We can grow fruits, vegetables and herbs which will help in the improvement of environment as well as the health of the City residents. Urban farming should not be taken as a Herculean task. It is only a matter of effort taken to’transform these areas/spaces into productive, community area. Thus, people will be able to breathe and live in pollution free environment which is good for the health. Conservation of soil and more of greenery will be an added advantage.
           <br/>
           I hope, people will become aware of these underused spaces and take some action after reading this letter of mine.

           Sir
           <br/>
           Through the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I wish to draw the attention of the general public towards the changing trend in the recreational activities of children of modem tunes. It is shocking to know that present day children don’t want to spend their leisure hours on book-reading, sports and games or any other outdoor activity as was done in the years from 1960-1980. Rather modem day juveniles are more interested in indoor activities. Only 10% of them are interested in book reading whereas 60% can be seen busy with gadgets. This is not a positive trend. It is leading our children towards poor health and stamina.
           <br/>
           In my opinion, children should be made to understand the importance of reading books and this can be done at school level as well as by parental interference. The advantages of outdoor games must be stressed upon. They must realise that outdoor games impart them the value of discipline as well as team spirit Parents should not provide them electronic gadgets at an early stage.
           <br/>
           Hope this letter of mine will spread awareness among children as well as parents and recreational activities of children will again get channelized in a positive way.

           Through the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I wish to draw the attention of the youngsters towards the negligent attitude of people towards basic health and hygiene. The villagers are not paying any attention to sanitation and personal hygiene which is leading them towards ill health. This hurdle can be overcome by organizing Health Camps in these areas where we can make these villagers aware of the importance of a healthy lifestyle by means of discussions or health check ups by specialists. A small dispensary can also be set up there for their regular routine check up. They must be taught that cleanliness is next to godliness. I invite youngsters through this letter of mine to volunteer their names so that we can put our plan into action. A little effort on our part will save these villagers from contracting serious diseases.

           Last Sunday I went to visit Taj Mahal along with my parents. I was quite excited but all the excitement was only shortlived as the place was not as beautiful as it should have been. The Taj no doubt, is an epitome of beauty. But the place outside was littered with plastic plates, broken bottles, leftover food, etc. Many tourists come to Agra to view Taj but the mess around the monument leaves a bad impression on the tourists. People must acquire some good civic habits. Dustbins should be provided at short distances and people should use them. They should throw the wastes and leftovers in the dustbins. Spitting of pan-masalas should not be done. Children should be taught dvic habits right from the beginning. Parents should ensure that the children are following good habits. There is a dire need to check all this and to take preventive steps.
           <br/>
           Through this letter of mine, I want to create awareness among general public that we must not neglect our archaeological and heritage sites. We must take good care of them by following good civic habits and following the code of conduct ethically.

We visited the place as a part of school exclusion but were shocked to see its plight. The water in the park was dirty and a stale smell was emnating from it.

           Through this letter of mine, I wish to draw the attention of the authorities towards the problems faced by students everyday. We reach our school fifteen minutes late as our school bus gets stuck in a traffic jam near Chintpumi Temple crossing. People park their vehicles in a haphazard way. Beggars crowd the gates as well as roads, waiting for someone to come out of the temple and give alms to them. There is a traffic signal at that crossing but people do not follow it.
           <br/>
           It is my humble request that a parking area should be allotted to the Temple site so that people can park their vehicles in a proper way. The Temple Trust should appoint someone who can make the beggars sit in a queue and that too on the footpath and not on the road. And last but not the least, a police-picket should be there at the crossing to make people follow the rules and regulations.
           <br/>
           I hope you’ll publish this letter in your esteemed newspaper so that some actions can be taken in this matter.

           <br/>
           Through the columns of your reputed newspaper, I wish to draw your attention towards the water supply in our colony. There is a great scarcity of water in our colony. We’re supplied water for only 3-4 hours in the whole day. The pressure at that time is so low that it is very difficult to finish the chores in time. Moreover, sometimes the water supplied is dirty and unclean. Most of the times, there is a power-cut also at the same hours when water is supplied which affects us a lot.
           <br/>
           So, I request the concerned authorities to improve the quality of water supplied in our area and increase the hours of supply so that the residents of our area do not face the problem. Everyone is aware that water is our basic necessity and we cannot do without it. I hope some positive action will be taken by the authorities at the earliest.
           <br/>
           Thanking you.
