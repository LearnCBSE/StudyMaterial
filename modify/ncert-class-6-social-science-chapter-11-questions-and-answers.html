            Think About It
           </strong>
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           How do you think can these old maps be helpful for us? Can they tell us something about the past and the present? (Page 167)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Old maps can be a help us to and how they have changed over time. They depict some important historical events happened and people moved from one place to others. They can help us to compare the nature of soil, rivers, population size and density. Moreover, if there is a dispute between villagers over ownership of a land, then these maps are quiet useful to sort out the dispute.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Why do you think it is important for the government to pay more attention to the needs and problems of the disadvantaged sections of society? (Page 170)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The government should pay more attention to the needs and problems of the disadvantaged sections of society because the basic philosophy of government is to ensure that everyone lives a decent life. The poorer sections have less resources, lees education, less skills and does not get an equal chance to earn and succeed in life. The disadvantaged sections are not able to provide even basic education and healthcare to their children which further leads to their poverty.
           <br/>
           Under such scenario it becomes the moral duty of government to take care of these people and uplift them from poverty . Government should also create conditions for their prosperity, then only India will succeed and develop.

           I hope this letter finds you in great health and happiness. I am writing this letter to highlight the increasing number of plastic bags lying on the roadside.
           <br/>
           The number of plastic bags lying on the roadside has been increasing day by day. It has become a serious threat to health and environmental to people and animals alike. They can also block drainage system. It is important that gram panchayat takes up this issue on urgent basis and finds a better solution of disposal and replacing the plastic bags with ecofriendly cotton and jute bags.
           <br/>
           I have full faith in your leadership, that you along with the other members will sort out these issues at the earliest and make our village neat and clean. It will set an example for other villages.
           <br/>
           Thank you for your time and attention.

</p>
<p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Let us suppose that you study in a village school. The school is located next to a highway and students find it difficult to cross the road when they come to school or leave at the end of the day. What are the options to solve this issue? Which institutions in the Panchayati Raj can help you? What can the students do?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           There may be several options to solve the issue of crossing the highway:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Construction of speed breakers or zebra crossing.
           </li>
<li>
            Appoint guard to help children cross the road.
           </li>
<li>
            Halting traffic for 10 minutes for children to cross the highway.
           </li>
<li>
            Making of pedestrian crossing.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Since the matters are concerning with Highway (State or National Highway), the Sarpanch of Gram Panchayat along with the Principal of the school can forward this issue to BDO-at the Block level. The BDO can take up this issue to DM-the administrative head of the Zila parishad who can coordinate with state government to solve this issue.
           <br/>
           Students can raise this issue through school authorities by making poster, writing letter and raising awareness.
