           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Answer the following questions briefly:
           <br/>
           (a) In 1953, Hooper was a favoured young man. Explain.
           <br/>
           (b) They said that they would create a desk job for Hooper at headquarters.
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Who are ‘they’?
           </li>
<li>
            Why did they decide to do this?
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           (c) Duke was an extraordinary dog. What special qualities did he exhibit to justify this? Discuss.
           <br/>
           (d) What problems did Chuck present when he returned to the company headquarters?
           <br/>
           (e) Why do you think Charles Hooper’s appointment as Assistant National Sales Manager is considered to be a tribute to Duke?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The year 1953 had been quite an auspicious year for Hooper. This youngman of six-feet- one-inch,’played in the university football team. He was already a ‘hard-charging’ zone sales manager for a chemical company. He was a man of highly competitive nature and always had a big genuine grin of satisfaction over his face. He was a favoured youngman liked by all. Everything was going well for him.
          </p>
<p>
           (b)
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            They were men from Hooper’s chemical company. After the fifth week of the accident, some men from his company came to the hospital and told Hooper to take a year off
           </li>
<li>
            Hooper’s company told him to take a year off. They also promised to create a desk job for him at headquarters. A man in a wheelchair with paralysed arm and leg couldn’t do the mobile job of a ‘hard- charging’ zone sales manager. Hence, a desk job was especially created for him at headquarters.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           (c) Duke was a four year old Dobermann pinscher weighing 23 kilos. Chuck Hooper liked Duke for his energy and cheerfulness. Duke knew what he had to do for Hooper.
           <br/>
           Once while jumping he hit Hooper about the belt, causing him to fight to keep his balance. He never jumped on Chuck Hooper again. With Hooper standing, the dog walked to the end of the leash and tugged steadily. Leaning against the pull, Hooper learned to keep his balance. In this way, Duke helped Hooper to go on for short walks.
          </p>
<p>
           (d) Chuck’s company had created a especial desk job for him. But when he returned to the company’s headquarters, this move created some problems. Chuck was fighting very hard for his come back. The people there didn’t know that Hooper had already set his next objective: ‘March 1, a full day’s work’. But no one dared to tell him that he couldn’t do justice to his job as a salesman. He couldn’t move properly and worked only an hour a day.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           (e) Charles Hooper was finally appointed Assistant National Sales Manager. Hooper’s appointment letter was so worded as if it was a special tribute to Duke. The words were “………. therefore, to advance our objectives step by step, ………..” It was just ‘step by step’ that Hooper learnt to maintain his balance and go for short walks. Duke made Hooper walk again like a normal man only ‘step by step’.

           Get into groups of four. Each team will choose one quality to talk about to the whole class for about one minute. But before you talk you have two minutes to think about it. You can make notes if you wish.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
<strong>
            Group A:
           </strong>
           Charles Hoopqr was a man of courage.
           <br/>
<strong>
            Group B:
           </strong>
           He met with such a horrible * accident but displayed great perseverance during his struggle for survival.
           <br/>
<strong>
            Group C:
           </strong>
           Leaning against the pull of leash held by his dog Duke, Hooper learnt how to hold the balance.
           <br/>
<strong>
            Group D:
           </strong>
           Many times he lost his balance and fell down exhausted. But he had wonderful endurance and it kept him going.
           <br/>
<strong>
            Group A:
           </strong>
           Hooper was a motivated man. He was full of determination. He declared that he would start a full day’s work at office from March 1.
           <br/>
<strong>
            Group B:
           </strong>
           He could surprise all his companions in the company. The company created a special desk job for him at the headquarters. But it created some problems.
           <br/>
<strong>
            Group C:
           </strong>
           No one was ready to tell him that a paralysed man couldn’t do the job of a moving salesman.
           <br/>
<strong>
            Group D
           </strong>
           But he had great faith in himself and in his ability to do things. No doubt, all along his dog Duke helped him in his struggle for survival.

            Writing Task
           </strong>
<br/>
           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Read the diary entry written by Charles Hooper on the day he received the order, Charles Hooper is appointed Assistant National Sales Manager.”
           <br/>
           March 1, 19… Thursday 10 pm
           <br/>
           Last four years have been eventful. The day I brought Duke home… (Marcy was almost impolite to him because she would have preferred a Pomeranian to a Doberman)… to a stage on October 12, 1957 (when she would not allow anyone else to carry the injured Duke to the vet)… much water has flowed under the bridge. From being a very fit high-charging zone sales manager, I was reduced to a paralysed cripple forced to lie on a bed alone with my thoughts due to a small error by a car driver. Despair had led me on to helplessness… Was I to be a vegetable for the rest of my life ? I never wanted to be a burden on Marcy.
          </p>
<p>
           Duke’s re-entry into my life lifted my numb spirits. The day he made me take my first step, there was a rekindled hope. Duke assumed all the responsibility for leading me back to my office desk… Life had taken a full circle. From shock to denial and helplessness to anger, Duke taught me to cope with the challenge and led me to accept the changed mode of life. I am happy to be living as well as working successfully.
          </p>
<p>
           The order that I have received today is my tribute to Duke who would always be alive with me and be a part of everything else I achieve in my life.

           When a person loses something, he is shocked and gets into a state of denial leading to anger. In such a situation coping well leads to acceptance and a changed way of living in view of the loss. Taking clues from what happened or might have happened with Hooper, write your views in the form of an article about’ ‘Coping with Loss’ in 150-175 words.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Coping With Loss
           <br/>
           Gain and Loss are the two facets of the same coin human life. Loss is inevitable at one time or the other in life. A man’s real courage, perseverance or endurance are tested only when a person loses something. The strong and the brave accept the loss. They say what can’t be cured must be endured. The weak lose their balance of mind and behaviour when they lose something. They lose their nerves to deal with such a thankless and unhappy position. The result is disastrous. They are shocked. They get into a state of denial leading to anger. They withdraw themselves. They are alienated from the mainstream of life. Coping well with such a situation leads to acceptance. And the acceptance leads to a changed way of living in view‘of the loss.

           The protagonist of the story ‘A Dog Named Duke’ Hooper was a very dynamic, healthy and successful man before he met with a terrible accident. The accident reduces him to a paralysed cripple. He is forced to lie on bed. Despair leads him to helplessness. But Duke’s entry lifts his numb spirits. He decides to cope with the loss and accepts the reality. He moves to a changed way of life. The day he makes his first step, it rekindles hope in him. He accepts a desk job at the headquarters. But life must go on. So, he declares that he will start doing a full day’s work from March 1. He does succeed. His long patience, endurance and the ability to cope with the loss is rewarded. He is appointed Assistant National Sales Manager of his company.

            Detailed Answer:
           </strong>
<br/>
           Duke was a loyal, faithful, understanding and intelligent dog. He had realized Chuck’s handicap after their very first meeting. Since then he did not ever jump at him after that. Duke would keep on motivating Chuck to move by nudging and poking him. He took Chuck for walk every day, covering a greater distance than before every time. Later, he insisted on two rounds in a day. Largely due to Duke’s efforts Chuck recovered. Yet, when the time came to reap the fruits of one’s efforts, to see Chuck being promoted in the office, he died. But such kind acts are always remembered by the one who are benefitted by his efforts. They are regarded as motivators and God’s messengers.

           Life is a continuous journey; a strange mixture of sweetness, bitterness, joys and sorrows. Some are unable to stand upright in the times of adversity and crumble but those who maintain courage and endurance, succesfully overcome the grief. Chuck could have chosen to remain paralysed and not respond to Duke’s helpful gestures. But he kept the flame of hope kindled and with his strong will power, overcomes His handicap. The story conveys the message that coping up with the challenges of life and accepting them as they come can give one an inner strength to find solutions to the most complex problems of life.

He displayed great perseverance during his struggle for survival with the help of his dog Duke. Not a single day went effortless. There was a commendable gradual progress from moving a step on the first day of his effort to walking up to the porch, then to the fence post, to the intersection and finally to the district office.Many a times he lost his balance and fell down exhausted but he had wonderful endurance that kept him going.Hooper was a person full of determination. He set dates as objectives and with the help of Duke, could achieve the same. He had faith in himself and in his ability, No one could dare to say that a paralyzed man couldn’t do the job of a moving salesman taking into account the hard work he did for a successful comeback. Hence, they created a special desk job for him. All along, his dog Duke helped him in his struggle for survival.’ Undoubtedly his courage and power of endurance mate him a strong contender for the award Hero Amongst Us.

</strong>
           Duke, the dog played a very significant role in bringing Chuck out of his critical condition. He was an extraordinary dog having special qualities and was the one who helped Chuck to increase his stability and endurance. He would take Chuck for a walk along the street, increasing the target everyday. He would stand still when Chuck sometimes struggled to get-up after tripping and falling. Even though he was a dog, he had assumed the responsibility of getting Chuck back on his feet, which he successfully did.
           <br/>
           Duke was a faithful and a loyal dog with extraordinary powers. He knew how impossible challenges could be accomplished. He nudged, needled, poked and forced his master to walk. He set new goals for him everyday. Chuck’s success is a tribute to his extraordinary dog.

             Question 9:
             <br/>
</strong>
</span>
           When a person loses something, he is shocked and gets into a state of denial leading to anger. In such a situation, coping well leads to acceptance and a changed way of living in view of the loss. Taking clues from what happened or might have happened to Hooper, write your views on ‘Coping with Losses’.

</strong>
</span>
           Loss is an inevitable part of life. During our lifetime we experience a variety of losses like the death of a beloved, loss of job financial security, or a relationship breakup. With loss comes grief. It is a very stressful phase of life. It can very quickly deplete your energy and emotional reserves. The most important thing is not let your grief control your life. Support of someone is very essential to combat grief.
           <br/>
           Chuck had everything going for him—a job, house and family but an accident robbed him of the ability to talk and move. He was then hit by pain and grief and felt depressed. Duke, his Doberman proved to be a Saviour in his life. He rekindled a hope in the family and taught him to cope with the challenge successfully. He not only conquered his handicap with Duke’s assistance and regained his job but was also promoted as the Assistant National Sales Manager.
           <br/>
           We should take inspiration from his life and should remain firm and strong in challenging adversities,

           Dear Julien,
           <br/>
           Hope you are in best of spirits.
           <br/>
           I am heartbroken at the sudden death of Duke. His death is a great loss for my family. How can I forget what he has done for our family.Chuck is well settled today and living a normal life but this happiness is a gift from Duke. We owe everything to Duke.
           <br/>
           The credit of Chuck’s recovery undoubtedly goes to Duke but his firm determination and iron willpower have also helped him to fight against all odds. The way Chuck regained his balance is by no means a Joke. I have seen the intelligent handling of Duke and the unconditional faith and trust in between the two. I am happy that he has been promoted to the post of Assistant National Sales Manager. He is doing well but I feel sad as Duke is no more. His positive attitude, patience and faith in Duke has helped him overcome the adverse circumstances and reach such heights. We owe our happiness to the extraordinary dog, Duke.

           Dear Diary
           <br/>
           After the car accident, I was completely bed-ridden due to the paralytic stroke on my left side, I was left alone in the house and missed company. 1 was then hit by pain and grief and felt depressed and lost. It was at this crucial juncture that Duke, my Doberman came as an angel in my life. He is responsible for getting me back on my feet. He assumed all the responsibility to make me stand on my feet. His sincerity, confidence and dedication brought me out of the deep, distressing water.I not only got my job back, but was also promoted.
           <br/>
           On 13 October 1957, Duke met with a fatal end. Little did I realize that I would lose him forever in an accident. His death has left a void in my life. My promotion to Assistant National Sales Manager is a special tribute to Duke. I owe a great deal to Duke, his devotion and dedication.My life itself is a gift from him. I am forever grateful to him and owe my success to him

           Dear Diary,
           <br/>
           It has been a month since we buried Duke. Tears well up in my eyes, at the thought of his loss. People whom I have not met for two years might feel surprised at the change that has come in my attitude. Oh! how I hated that huge dog when Chuck brought him home, he seemed to take so much place and expected everyone to pamper him. Somehow I feel that Duke knew that I didn’t like him, so he remained out of my way. He was so much Chuck’s dog that he would follow him like a shadow. That fareful accident changed my life for better or worse. My first instinct as to put Duke into a kennel as the thought or looking after him in the absence of Chuck was unthinkable. I finally got him home after much pressure from all quarters. Chuck who was slowly going into depression didn’t really care at that time, A chance touch at the collar of Duke charged him up. It was as if Duke had become the instructor and Chuck the student. I saw the silent understanding, I saw the intelligent handling, I saw the unconditional faith and trust in each other. Gradually, I realized how ignorant I had been, how I had missed the opportunity to befriend this lovely creature who was ready in attendance. The way he helped Chuck regain his balance is by no means joke. The last two years of his life, Duke devotedly served his master. I am amazed at the change that has come over me. My tolerance level for big dogs has increased. I was heart broken at his sudden death. If only I had shown him my love before, but man cannot turn put the clock back.
           <br/>
           Good Night.
