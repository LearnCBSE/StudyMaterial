<strong>
            8.Explain any four factors which affect the working capital requirements of a company. (All India 2013)
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans
           </strong>
           . Working capital is that part of total capital which is required for holding current assets. It may also be defined as an excess of current assets over current liabilities.
           <br/>
           The four main factors affecting working capital requirements are as follows
           <br/>
           (i)
           <strong>
            Production cycle
           </strong>
           It is the time span between the receipt of raw materials and their conversion into finished goods. Length of production cycle affects the working capital requirement. If the duration of production cycle is longer, the working capital requirements to meet day-to-day expenses would be higher and vice-versa.
           <br/>
           (ii)
           <strong>
            Business cycle
           </strong>
           At times of boom period in the market, e.g. Diwali, Guru Parv, etc. The production as well as sales are likely to be higher. Whereas, the working capital requirement would be lower in times of depression in the market.        •
           <br/>
           (iii)
           <strong>
            Nature of business
           </strong>
           A trading business needs less amount of working capital because there is no processing of goods. On the other hand, the working capital requirement would be more in case of manufacturing business where raw materials are converted into finished goods.
           <br/>
           (iv)
           <strong>
            Scale of operations
           </strong>
           A large scale organisation requires large amount of working capital as compared to a small scale organisation because the quantum of inventory, debtors and cash required is generally high.
          </p>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">
             9.Explain any four factors which affect the ‘fixed capital’ requirements of a company.
            </span>
            (All India 2013)
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans
           </strong>
           . The amount of capital investment in fixed assets is called fixed capital, e.g. plant and machinery, land and building, etc.
           <br/>
           (i)
           <strong>
            Nature of business
           </strong>
           While deciding the fixed capital requirement of a business enterprise, its nature should be considered, e.g. trading concern needs lower investment in fixed assets as compared with a manufacturing organisation; since it does not require to purchase plant and machinery, etc.
           <br/>
           (ii)
           <strong>
            Scale of operations
           </strong>
           A large organisation operating at a higher scale needs higher investment in fixed assets as compared to the small organisation.                                                                                          (iii)
           <strong>
            Choice of technique
           </strong>
           A capital intensive organisation requires higher investment in plant and machinery. So, requirement of fixed capital would be higher. On the other hand, labour intensive organisation requires less investment in fixed assets.
           <br/>
           (iv)
           <strong>
            Technology upgradation
           </strong>
           These days upgradation with the latest technologies is essential and there is a need to replace the old technology with new. Thus, in this case, higher investment is required and vice-versa.

           (i)
           <strong>
            Nature of business
           </strong>
           A trading business needs less amount of working capital because there is no processing of goods. On the other hand, the working capital requirement would be more in case of manufacturing business where raw materials are converted into finished goods.
           <br/>
           (ii)
           <strong>
            Scale of operation
           </strong>
           A large scale organisation requires large amount of working capital as compared to small scale organisation because the quantum of inventory, debtors and cash required is generally high.
           <br/>
           (iii)
           <strong>
            Seasonal factors
           </strong>
           Business operations are affected by the seasonal changes. As during peak season higher are the level of activities and higher the requirements of working capital, on the other hand, during lean season requirements of working capital will be lower.

<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           Working capital is the capital invested in current assets which facilitates day-to-day operations of
           <br/>
           the business. The amount of working capital required depends on various factors;
           <br/>
           Factors affecting working capital requirement are:
           <br/>
           (i)
           <strong>
            Business cycle
           </strong>
           Different phases of business cycles affect the requirement of working capital by a firm. In case of a boom, the sales as well as production are likely to be larger and, therefore, larger amount of working capital is required. As against this, the requirement for working capital will be lower during the period of depression as the sales as well as production will be small.
           <br/>
           (ii)
           <strong>
            Operating efficiency
           </strong>
           Firms manage their operations with varied degrees of efficiency. For example, a firm managing its raw materials efficiently may be able to manage with a smaller balance. This is reflected in a higher inventory turnover ratio. Similarly, a better debtors turnover ratio may be achieved reducing the amount tied up in receivables. Better sales effort may reduce the average time for which finished goods inventory is held. Such efficiencies may reduce the level of raw materials, finished goods and debtors resulting in lower requirement of working capital.
           <br/>
           (iii)
           <strong>
            Availibility of raw material
           </strong>
           It raw material required in freely available, lower stock levels may be sufficient and vice-versa lead time, i.e. time lag between placing the order and actual receipt of material is also a major determinant.
           <br/>
           A larger lead time will require larger amount of raw material to be stored, thus larger amount of working capital is required.
           <br/>
           (iv)
           <strong>
            Level of competition
           </strong>
           Higher level of competitiveness may necessitate larger stocks of finished goods to meet urgent orders from customers. This increases the working capital requirement.

<strong>
            Explain any four factors affecting fixed capital requirement of a company.(Compartment 2014)
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           The capital invested in fixed assets like land and buildings, plant and machinery, furnitures and
           <br/>
           fixtures etc, is known as fixed capital. How much is to be invested in fixed capital. How much is to
           <br/>
           be invested in fixed assets is determined by many factors.
           <br/>
           Factors affecting fixed capital requirement are:
           <br/>
           (i)
           <strong>
            Scale of operations
           </strong>
           A larger organisation operating at a higher scale needs higher investment in fixed assets as compared with the small organisation.
           <br/>
           (ii)
           <strong>
            Choice of technique
           </strong>
           Some organisations are capital intensive whereas others are labour intensive. A capital intensive organisation requires higher investment in plant and machinery as it relies less on manual labour. The requirement of fixed capital for such organisations would be higher. Labour intensive organisations on the other hand require less investment in fixed assets.
           <br/>
           (iii)
           <strong>
            Technology upgradation
           </strong>
           In certain industries, assets become obsolete sooner. Consequently, their replacements become due faster. Higher investment in fixed assets may, therefore, be required in such cases, e.g. computers become obsolete faster and are replaced much sooner than say, furniture. Thus, such organisations which use assets are prone to obsolescence require higher fixed capital to purchase such assets.
           <br/>
           (iv)
           <strong>
            Financing alternatives
           </strong>
           Availability of leasing facilities reduce the fund requirement to be invested in fixed capital as the firm has to only pay lease rentals against outright purchase of the asset.

           (i)
           <strong>
            Nature of business
           </strong>
           The type of business has a bearing upon the fixed capital requirements, e.g. a trading concern needs lower investment in fixed assets compared with a manufacturing organisation, since it does not require to purchase plant and machinery, etc.
           <br/>
           (ii)
           <strong>
            Growth prospects
           </strong>
           Higher growth of an organisation generally requires higher investment in fixed assets. Even when such growth is expected, a company may choose to create higher capacity in order to meet the anticipated higher demand quicker. This entails larger investment in fixed assets and consequently larger fixed capital.
           <br/>
           (iii)
           <strong>
            Diversification
           </strong>
           If a firm diversify its operations, its fixed capital requirements increases.
           <br/>
           (iv)
           <strong>
            Level of collaboration
