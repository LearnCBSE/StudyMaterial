           Question 1.
           <br/>
           What are the two strange things the guru and his disciple find in the Kingdom of Fools?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Guru and the disciple found that in the Kingdom of Fools people used to work during nights and sleep during days. Everything was cheap and cost the same.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Why does the disciple decide to stay in the Kingdom of Fools? Is it a good idea?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Everything was cheap in the Kingdom of Fools. The disciple had peculiarity of diet. He was tempted by the cheap food. So, he decided to stay in that kingdom. It was not a good idea to stay there for a long time as one could be in danger any time because of the unpredictable behaviour of fools.

           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Name all the people who are tried in the king’s court, and give the reasons for their trial.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The owner of the house i.e. the merchant, the bricklayer, the dancing girl and the goldsmith were tried in the king’s court. They all were tried because the thief died when the wall of merchant’s house had collapsed. The merchant was tried for building a weak wall. The bricklayer was tried for doing his work carelessly. The dancing girl was tried for disturbing the concentration of the bricklayer. The goldsmith was blamed for making the dancing girl walk up and down to his house a dozen times.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Who is the real culprit according to the king? Why does he escape punishment?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The merchant’s dead father was held responsible for making the wall weak. But according to the king the rich merchant was the real culprit because he had inherited both sins and riches of his father. He escaped the punishment because he was too thin to fit the stake.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           What are the Guru’s words of wisdom? When does the disciple remember them?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Guru was full of wisdom and knew well that the unpredictable behaviour of the fools could create danger anytime. The Guru’s words were, “They are all fools. This won’t last very long, and you can’t tell what they’ll do to you next”. The disciple remembered them when he was arrested by the men of the king to execute merely because he fitted the stake. It was because of the Guru’s words of wisdom that the execution was postponed.

           Question 6.
           <br/>
           How does the Guru manage to save his disciple’s life?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Guru arrived on time to save his disciple and created a drama. He told the king that it was not an ordinary stake and whoever went to the stake first would become the king in next life. The second to die would become his minister. The king wanted to avail himself of the opportunity. The Guru and his disciple were released. Thus the Guru managed to save his disciple’s life.

           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>
           Why were the people of the kingdom confused when they saw the dead bodies of the king and his minister ?
           <strong>
            (SA-1,2014)
           </strong>
<br/>
           Answer:

          </p>

<p>
           Question 2:
           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>
           When does the disciple remember the words of his Guru?
           <strong>
            (SA-1, DDE-2014)
           </strong>
<br/>
           Answer:
           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>
           The disciple did not pay any heed to the advice of his Guru, when the Guru asked him to leave the kingdom of fools. When the king decided that the disciple was the suitable person for execution, he remembered the words of the Guru.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 3:
           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>
           How was the kingdom of fools different from any other place ?
           <strong>
            (SA-1,2014-15)
           </strong>
<br/>
           Answer:
           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>
           Everything was different at the kingdom of fools. The night was considered as day and day as night. Not only the human beings even the animals stayed awake at night. Anything and everything could be bought for a Dudu.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 4:
           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>
           Why did the Guru want that he and his disciple should die first ?
           <strong>
            (Board Term Sept 1,2013, K2G41GH)
           </strong>
<br/>
           Answer:
           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>
           The king had ordered the execution of the rich merchant. Since the rich merchant could not be executed the disciple was chosen to fit the stake. The disciple’s Guru had a vision and saw everything. In order to save his disciple, the Guru hatched a plan.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 5:
           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>
           On what conditions did the Guru and his distiple agree to rule that kingdom ?
           <br/>
<strong>
            (Board Term Sept 1,2013, GKK73AP)
           </strong>
<br/>
           Answer:
           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>
           He laid the condition that he would be free to change all the old and foolish laws. Hence night was considered as night and day was regarded as a normal working day. Even persuaded prices were changed according to the value of the material.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 6:
           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>
           Why did the Guru not want to stay in the Kingdom of fools ?
           <strong>
            (Board Term 1,2012, ELI-013)
           </strong>
<br/>
           Answer:
           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>
           The Guru did not wanted to stay in the Kingdom of fools as the people over there were foolish. He was not sure about them and felt that they could harm him.

           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>

<br/>
           Answer:
           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>
           The king ordered to execute the disciple. He prayed to his Guru to save him. The Guru heard his prayer in his vision and appeared to rescue his disciple. First, he whispered something in his disciple’s ears and then asked the king to execute him first. And the disciple followed suit, which puzzled the king. Knowing the secret, the king fell into the trap of his temptation and wanted to be the king in his rebirth. He went into the prison at night and set the guru and disciple free. In their place, he and his minister disguised themselves as the guru and the disciple and got executed. Thus, the Guru managed to save his disciple.

<p>
           Question 6:
           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>
           “Guru was a wise man” – how does the story “The Kingdom of fools” reflect it ?
           <strong>
            (Board Term 1,2012, ELI-014)
           </strong>
<br/>
           Answer:
           <strong>
<br/>
</strong>
           “The Kingdom of Fools” clearly reflects that “Guru was a wise man” as he advised his disciple not to stay in that kingdom. As the disciple thought that the future is uncertain, he did not pay any heed to his Guru and stayed on. When he was imprisoned by the King’s men, he realized the significance of his Guru’s words and repented on his not following his Guru’s advice. So, it is proved that Guru was really very wise. And it was because of his wisdom that disciple was saved and they were made king and prime-minister of the kingdom.
