           <br/>
           (l) What is the ‘refrain’ in the poem? What effect does it create?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The brook sparkles when the sunlight and the rays fall on its watery surface. The watery surface acts as a medium and reflects the sun rays producing a sparkling effect. The brook “sparklefs) out among the fern” growing near its banks.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) When the brook flows out of the place of its birth and flows down, it makes a lot of noise which gives out the idea of noise bom out of ‘a quarrel’. The poet uses the word “bicker” which means ‘to quarrel’. He seems to be using the right word at the right place. The word ‘bicker’ denotes the noisy and quarrelsome sound of the flowing river.
          </p>
<p>
           (c) The brook passes through thirty hills and fifty bridges during its journey, before it joins the brimming river.
          </p>

</div>
<p>
           (d) The brook meets the brimming river by Philip’s farm.
          </p>
<p>
           (e) The word ‘chatter’ has been repeatedly used in the poem. The first use is, “I chatter over stony ways.” The second time it is, “I chatter, chatter as I flow.” The word ‘chatter’ means to talk quickly in a friendly way, without stopping. The poet uses the appropriate word to denote the non-stop talking sound of the brook while
           <br/>
           it is negotiating its stony ways. Even the sound of the flowing river is repeatedly called ‘chatter’ as it is constant, non-stop and friendly.
          </p>
<p>
           (f ) The line ‘With many a curve my banks I fret’ expresses the aggressive mood of the flowing brook. The course of the brook is never in a straight line. When the brook strikes the jutting parts of the land it is forced to flow in curves. The water frets and fumes when it strikes and flows round the curvy course. It beats its banks in anger.
          </p>
<p>
           (g) The onward course of the brook is never in a straight line. It is the tendency of water to make its way wherever it can enter in the gaps. The brook flows on in a zig-zag way finding its own course. Sometimes it goes inside the creeks and fills it with water. When the area is flat, the water comes out moving in a more relaxed way widening its surface.
          </p>
<p>
           (h) The brook is a source of life. We find many things that can be found floating in the brook. We find blossoms ‘sailing’ over its surface. And ‘here and there’ we find a ‘lusty trout’ and ‘a grayling’ swimming in and out of its watery surface. As it travels onwards we can see ‘foamy flakes’ floating over its surface.
          </p>
<p>
           (i) The flowing pattern and course of the brook is never uniform. There are places where the brook steals by ‘lawns and grassy plots’. Here, it moves secretly and quietly so that its movement remains unnoticed. The brook ‘slides by hazel covers’ growing near its banks. Here the movement is easy, quiet but quicker than before. The brook flows like the journey of life negotiating all hurdles and obstructions on the way. ,
          </p>
<p>
           (j) Tennyson makes every effective use of alliteration to create a special poetic and sound effect. The five examples of ‘alliteration’ in the poem are:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            ‘t’ sound in ‘twenty thorpes, a little town’.
           </li>
<li>
            T sound in ‘farm’ and ‘flow’ and ‘field and fallow’.
           </li>
<li>
            ‘w’ sound in ‘with willows-weed’.
           </li>
<li>
            ‘b’ sound in ‘bubble’ … ‘bays’ and ‘babble’.
           </li>
<li>
            ‘d’ and‘t’ sounds in ‘wind about and in and out’.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           (k) The rays of the sun fall on the watery surface of the brook. The sunbeams get netted. The watery surface acts as a net or a reflector. The trapped sunbeams are reflected back. The sparkling sunbeams seem to be dancing when the water flows in the sunlight.
          </p>
<p>
           (l) A refrain is the part of a song or a poem that is repeated a number of times. The refrain in the poem is:
           <br/>
           For men may come and men may go,
           <br/>
           But 1 go on for ever.
           <br/>
           The refrain used in the poem heightens the poetic and musical effects. It brings out the eternal existence of the brook and transitory existence of man’s life in this world. Secondly, it highlights the single idea and maintains the unity of the poem.

           Question 8.

           (d) Explain the last two lines of the stanza.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) T refers to the brook in the given lines.
           <br/>
           (b) The flowing motion of the brook creates a chattering sound. It appears as if it is talking sofly and constantly in a friendly manner with anything that obstructs its flow.
           <br/>
           (c) The poet has used the word ‘brimming’ for the bigger river the brook is ultimately going to join in. It creates a picture of a big river filled with water up to the brim.
           <br/>
           (d) The refrain in the poem presents a striking contrast. Men may come and go in and out of this world. Their existence is transitory. However, the brook presents a picture of eternity. It will flow forever

</p>
<p>
           Question 10.
           <br/>
           The poem is full of images that come alive through skilful use of words. List out any two images that appeal to you the most, quoting the lines from the poem.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The poem ‘The Brook’ is full of images that come alive through skilful use of words. The first image that appeals to me the most is the one that recaptures its course before it joins the brimming river.
          </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
           ‘By thirty hills I hurry down.
           <br/>
           Or slip between the ridges
           <br/>
           By twenty thorpes, a little town,
           <br/>
           And half a hundred bridges.
          </p>
<p>
           The noticeable feature is the pace of the lines. When the brook is in its infancy it passes through thirty hills and its movement is very quick. It hurries down. Then it passes through the narrow ridges and here it slips between them. Then the pace is a bit relaxed when it passes through twenty small hamlets or villages, a little town and under half a hundred bridges.
          </p>
<p>
           The second image is the ‘chattering’ quality of the brook. The river seems to be talking constantly in a friendly way to the things that obstruct its flow. After ‘chattering’ the brook prepares itself to join the brimming river. The image of‘brimming river’ brings into our minds a river which is full of water to its brim.
          </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
           I chatter, chatter, as I flow
           <br/>
           To join the brimming river ’.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 11.
           <br/>
           The brook appears to be a symbol for life.
           <br/>
           Pick out examples of parallelism between life and the brook.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The brook is, definitely, a symbol for life. There are many examples of parallelism between life and the brook:
           <br/>
           (i) Infancy: There is a striking parallel between human life and the life of the brook. As an infant suddenly appears in this world, the brook makes a ‘sudden sally’ or emerges suddenly from the place of its birth.
           <br/>
           (ii) Youth: In human beings this is the period when ‘life’ is at its peak. One is strong, full of enthusiasm and dynamism. All his movements are dynamic and full of action. Similarly, in its youth, the brook shows enthusiasm in its movement. It also shows anger.
          </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
           “By thirty hills I hurry down
           <br/>
           Or slip between the ridges. ”
          </p>
<p>
           The other words which express its youthful movement are ‘bickers’, ‘frets’ and ‘chatters”.
           <br/>
           (iii) Life-Support System: The brook is symbol for life. It provides a support system to life. The brook is full of‘trouts’ and ‘graylings’ which provide food for animals and human beings.
           <br/>
           (iv) Old Age—Leisurely Movement: Before it ultimately joins the brimming river, the brook sheds its fret and anger. It assumes a leisurely and peaceful demeanour while ‘stealing’ by grassy lawns and plots or ‘sliding’ by hazel covers.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 12.
           <br/>
           This poem describes the journey of a stream from its place of origin to the river that it joins. The poem has been written in the form of an autobiography where the brook relates its experiences as it flows towards the river. In Literature such a device by which an inanimate object is made to appear as a living creature is called Personification. Just as the brook has been personified in this poem, write a poem on any inanimate object making it come alive. You could begin with a poem of 6-8 lines. The poem should have a message. Maintain a rhyme scheme. Try and include similes, metaphors, alliteration etc. to enhance the beauty of the poem. You could write a poem on objects such as the candle/a tree/a rock/the desert etc.
           <br/>
           This could be given as a homework activity. The teacher could read out some of the poems in the class and display the others.

           The brook (a small river) takes its birth from a place which is regularly visited by waterbirds like coots and herons. The small river bursts out all of a sudden. Sparkling or shining through the flowerless plants or ferns in the sunlight, it flows noisily down to a valley.

           The brook flows on making different kinds of noises and sounds at different places. It seems to chatter while flowing through its stony ways. It also makes sharp and high-pitched sounds and noises. When it flows in the spiral movement of water, its noise is lost. But when it strikes on the shingles and pebbles, it creates a sound as if it is talking gaily to them.

The brook flows through those parts of land which extend into the sea and look like lands of fairies. It passes through bushes of willow and plants of mallow growing near its banks.

           और फिर मैं बाहर निकल कर मुड़ती और बहती हुई उस बड़ी नदी में जो किनारों तक लबालब पानी से भरी है, में मिलने के लिए चली आती हैं। क्योंकि मनुष्य चाहे इस संसार में जन्म लेने के लिये आयें या मरकर इससे बाहर चले जायें, मैं तो सदैव यूँ ही बहती रहूंगी।

           Then the brook comes out curving and flowing to join the big river that is filled with water to the brim. Worldly activities will have no bearing on the brook. Men may take birth or die but the brook goes on flowing onward forever.

           The brook’s varying movements create an exhilarating musical effect. “Chattering over stony ways” creates the effect of a rhythmic movement combining high and low musical notes. “I steal by lawns” creates a slow, lethargic and rhythmic movement. The “Lingering”, “Loitering” movements are followed by speedy “pace, curve and flow”.

           The poet draws a parallelism between the journey of a brook and the humans. The brook is generous. It deposits silt across its bank throughout the way. It nourishes the soil and prevents soil erosion. The brook is also very courteous as it never repels anything, but draws everything along. Just like the journey of the brook, humans also have to pass through various ups and downs in life. Like the brook, we too have to overcome them and move on, forgetting mutual differences. Today’s generation misses the quality of courtesy and patience above everything else. This needs to be imbibed.

             Answer:
             <br/>
</strong>
</span>
           The brook is a symbol of life. The poet has compared the brook’s journey with that of human life. Just like a human being, the brook also emerges (takes birth), grows young, becomes old and wise. In its childhood, it is very cheerful. It moves rapidly and swiftly.
           <br/>
           In its youth, it is full of strength. It ‘frets’, ‘bickers’ and ‘chatters’ which are symbolic of young age. It is a source of life and support for other living things like fish, blossoms, etc. Then it reaches its old age. Like human beings, it becomes weak and moves slowly. It ‘slides’ by hazel covers and ‘steals’ by lawns. Now the brook flows silently. Its ultimate aim is to reach its destination, i.e., the brimming river.
           <br/>
           The brook faces and overcomes many difficulties and hurdles in its way. Man should learn a lesson from the brook. He should not lose heart in the face of hurdles, pressures and dangers. He should not be fret and fume in the face of difficulties.

           The journey of both, the brook and human beings commences with birth. Both have a desire to move forward and explore the world. Neither the life of a man nor the journey of the brook is smooth. Both come across different situations. Just as the brook passes through many ups and downs throughout its journey, man also faces many ups and downs in his life. As man moves forward, he becomes mature and finally his life comes to an end. Similarly, the brook moves forward and its journey ends when it merges in the river. The only difference between the two is that die brook is eternal whereas man’s existence is transitory.

           The poem draws a parallel between the journey of the brook and the journey of human life. Similar to the journey of the brook, human life also passes through many ups and downs.The brook passes through many hills, ridges, towns, villages and bridges and reveals its mood by the sound it makes when it moves on. Similarly, man also has to overcome many hurdles and difficulties in life and struggle hard to reach his destination.Neither the life of man nor the journey of the brook is smooth. But, just as the brook goes on undaunted and heads towards its destination, human beings must also go on.

           The brook emerges from the places which are frequently visited by water birds like ‘coot and hern’.It emerges suddenly to flow down a valley with a lot of noise. During its journey it passes many hills, towns, villages and passes under bridges. It silently crosses both fertile and fallow land, lawns filled with flowers and goes through the wilderness full of thorny bushes. The brook also passes many ‘fairy fore lands’ which are covered with willow weed and mallow. It flows slowly when it passes the strange places. It then curves and flows to join the brimming river.

           The brook goes through different stages of life as does a human being. In the way a child takes birth, the brook emerges from the haunts of coot and hern. Just like a child, the brook chatters and babbles. It is as energetic as a human being in the initial stages of its life. As human beings work to fulfil their aim in life, the brooks aim is to join the brimming river. Man faces a lot of challenges in life, likewise, the brook takes many twists and turns during its second course.
           <br/>
           In the third course, the brook slows down and slips, slides, find steals by the lawns and grassy plots. In the same way, in old age, man becomes quiet and understanding.

</strong>
</span>
           ‘The Brook” is an autobiographical poem. The poet has used the poetic device personification in this poem. The brook narrates its journey right from the time it emerges from the ‘haunts of coot and hems’ to its end which is ‘to join the brimming river’. personification has made this narration quite interesting. The use of words like frets, bicker, chatter bring before us an image of a young angry man, whereas the movement is described by many other beautiful comparisons. The description is very vivid and makes one feel as if the brook is a living thing, narrating the story of its own life. Hence, the title “The Brook” is appropriate.

</span>
           The lines ‘For men may come and men may go, but I go on forever’ are very significant. These lines are the refrain of the poem- They depict the striking contrast between the brook whose journey is eternal and never ending and the human life which is transitory and has to come to an end one day or the other. These lines tell that man is mortal, whereas the brook, a symbol of nature, is immortal.

           The brook enjoys a long journey. It emerges from the place which is frequently visited by water birds. From there it flows down the valley and through towns. On its way it creates a lot of noise while crossing stony paths and fields. Sometimes, the brook moves in a zig-zag manner. It’s a, source of life for the fish and flowers. The water in it is so transparent that its bottom is clearly visible. The sunbeams also seem to dance on it. When passing through thorny wilderness, it just murmurs. When the brook originates it flows rapidly but gradually it slows down. It has only one thought in its mind and that is to join the fiver which it finally meets at Philip’s farm and becomes one with the river. The description of its journey and, the places it passes by, like many a ‘fairy foreland’ give the poem its aura of mystery and magic.

             Answer:
             <br/>
</strong>
</span>
           The central idea or the theme of the poem is the comparison l ween the eternal, continuous and never-ending journey of the brook and the transitoriness of a man’s life.
           <br/>
           The brook overcomes many hurdles and struggles throughout its journey and keeps on moving. It never stops.
           <br/>
           Similarly, human beings also have to face many ups and downs, They should not accept defeat, but must go on like the brook.
           <br/>
           One must keep on moving towards one’s goal and reach, their destination.
