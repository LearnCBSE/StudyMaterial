           Question 11.
           <br/>
           Define capacitor reactance. Write its S.I. units. (Delhi 2015)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           ‘Capacitor reactance’ is defined as the opposition to the flow of current in ac circuits offered by a capacitor.
           <br/>
<img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 7 Alternating Current Class 12 Important Questions 8" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117104" height="48" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-7-Alternating-Current-Class-12-Important-Questions-8.png" width="80"/>
<br/>
           S.I. Unit : Ohm.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 12.
           <br/>
           A variable frequency AC source is connected to a capacitor. Will the displacement current change if the frequency of the AC source is decreased? (Comptt. All India 2015)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           On decreasing the frequency of AC source, reactance, \(x_{C}=\frac{1}{\omega C}\) will increase, which will lead to decrease in conduction current. In this case
           <br/>
           I
           <sub>
            D
           </sub>
           = I
           <sub>
            C
           </sub>
<br/>
           Hence, displacement current will decrease.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 13.
           <br/>
           Plot a graph showing variation of capacitive reactance with the change in the frequency of the AC source. (Comptt. All India 2015)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Graph showing a variation of x
           <sub>
            c

           Question 23.
           <br/>
           State the principle of working of a transformer. Can a transformer be used to step up or step down a d.c. voltage? Justify your Answer. (All India 2009)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Transformer works on the principle of mutual induction, i.e., when a changing current is passed through one of the two inductively coupled coils, an induced emf is set up in the other coil.
          </p>
<p>
           No, transformer cannot be used to step up or step down a d.c. voltage because d.c. voltage cannot produce a change in magnetic flux.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) A transformer is an electrical device for converting an alternating current at low voltages into that at high voltage or vice versa.
           <br/>
           If it increases the input voltage, it is called step- up-transformer.

<br/>
           Principle : It works on the principle of mutual induction i.e., “when a changing current is passed through one of the two inductively coupled coils, an induced emf is set up in the other coil.”
          </p>
<p>
           Working : As the alternating current flows through the primary, it generates an alternating magnetic flux in the core which also passes through the secondary. This changing flux sets up an induced emf in the secondary, also a self- induced emf in the primary. If there is no leakage of magnetic flux, then flux linked with each turn
           <br/>
           of the primary will be equal to that linked with each turn of the secondary.

           .
           <br/>
           The output voltage is greater than the input voltage.
          </p>
<p>
           Main assumptions :
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            The primary resistance and current are small.
           </li>
<li>
            The same flux links both with the primary and secondary windings as the flux leakage from due core is negligible (small).
           </li>
<li>
            The terminals of the secondary are open or the current taken from it, is small, (any two)
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           For long distance transmission, the voltage output of the generator is stepped-up (so that current is reduced and consequently, IR loss is reduced). It is transmitted over long distance and is stepped- down at distributing substations at consumers’ end.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Two sources of energy loss in a transformer:
           <br/>
           1. Copper loss”: Some energy is lost due to heating of copper wires used in the primary and secondary windings. This power loss (= I
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
           R) can be minimised by using thick copper wires of low resistance.
          </p>
<p>
           2. Eddy current loss : The alternating magnetic flux induces eddy currents in the iron core which leads to some energy loss in the form of heat. This loss can be reduced by using laminated iron core.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) No, a step up transformer does not violate law of conservation of energy because whatever is gained in voltage ratio is lost in the current ratio and vice-versa. It steps up the voltage while it steps down the current.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 25.
           <br/>
           State the underlying principle of a transformer.
           <br/>
           How is the large scale transmission of electric energy over long distances done with the use of transformers? (All India 2012)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A transformer is an electrical device for converting an alternating current at low voltages into that at high voltage or vice versa.
           <br/>
           If it increases the input voltage, it is called step- up-transformer.
           <br/>

<br/>
           Principle : It works on the principle of mutual induction i.e., “when a changing current is passed through one of the two inductively coupled coils, an induced emf is set up in the other coil.”
          </p>
<p>
           Working : As the alternating current flows through the primary, it generates an alternating magnetic flux in the core which also passes through the secondary. This changing flux sets up an induced emf in the secondary, also a self- induced emf in the primary. If there is no leakage of magnetic flux, then flux linked with each turn
           <br/>
           of the primary will be equal to that linked with each turn of the secondary.

           Question 32.
           <br/>
           A lamp is connected in series with a capacitor. Predict your observation when this combination is connected in turn across
           <br/>
           (i) ac source and
           <br/>
           (ii) a ‘dc’ battery. What change would you notice in each case if the capacitance of the capacitor is increased? (Comptt. Delhi 2012)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When dc source is connected, the condenser is charged but no current flows in the circuit, therefore, the lamp does not glow. No change occurs even when capacitance of capacitor is increased.
          </p>
<p>
           When ac source is connected, the capacitor offers capacitive reactance \(X_{c}=\frac{1}{\omega C}\). The current flows in the circuit and the lamp glows. On increasing capacitance, X
           <sub>
            c

           decreases. Therefore, glow pf the bulb increases.

           Question 43.
           <br/>
           Draw a sketch showing the basic elements of an a.c. generator. State its principle and explain briefly its working. (Comptt. All India 2008)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Principle of A.C. generator : The working of an a.c. generator is based on the principle of electromagnetic induction. When a closed coil is rotated in a uniform magnetic field with its axis perpendicular to the magnetic field, the magnetic flux linked with the coil changes and an induced emf and hence a current is set up in it.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) Let N = number of turns in the coil
           <br/>
           A = Area of face of each turn
           <br/>
           B = magnitude of the magnetic field
           <br/>
           θ = angle which normal to the coil makes with field B at any instant
           <br/>

</p>
<p>
           (ii) To make power factor unity, ϕ = 0°, hence we need to adjust C to a new value C’, the condition is :
           <br/>
           X
           <sub>
            C
           </sub>
           = X
           <sub>
            L
           </sub>
           = 100 Ω
           <br/>
           Thus, phase angle is 45° with the current leading the voltage.
          </p>
<p>
           To make power factor unity, we need to have X
           <sub>
            C
           </sub>
           also equal to 100 Ω. For this, C needs to have a value of 10µ.
          </p>
<p>
           We, therefore, need to put an additional capacitor of (10 – 2), i.e., 8 µF in parallel with the given capacitor.

           Question 59.
           <br/>
           An a.c. source generating a voltage v = v
           <sub>
            m
           </sub>
           sin ω t is connected to a capacitor of capacitance C. Find the expression for the current, i, flowing through it. Plot a graph of v and i versus tat to show that the current is π/2 ahead of the voltage. A resistor of 200Ω and a capacitor of 15.0 µF are connected in series to a 220 V, 50 Hz a.c. source. Calculate the current in the circuit and the rms voltage across the resistor and the capacitor. Is the algebraic sum of these voltages more than the source voltage? If yes, resolve the paradox.

           The algebraic sum of the two voltages, V
           <sub>
            R
           </sub>
           and V
           <sub>
            C
           </sub>
           is 311.3 V which is more than the source voltage of 220 V. These two voltages are 90° out of phase. These cannot be added like ordinary numbers. The voltage is obtained by using Pythagoras theorem,
           <br/>
<img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 7 Alternating Current Class 12 Important Questions 67" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117034" height="66" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-7-Alternating-Current-Class-12-Important-Questions-67.png" width="271"/>
<br/>
           Thus if the phase difference between two voltages is properly taken into account, the total voltage across the resistor and the capacitor is equal to the voltage of the source.

           Question 60.
           <br/>
           Explain briefly, with the help of a labelled diagram, the basic principle of the working of an a.c. generator.
           <br/>
           In an a.c. generator, coil of N turns and area A is rotated at v revolutions per second in a uniform magnetic field B. Write the expression for the emf produced.
           <br/>
           A 100-turn coil of area 0.1 m2 rotates at half a revolution per second. It is placed in a magnetic field 0.01 T perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the coil. Calculate the maximum voltage generated in the coil. (All India 2008)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Principle of A.C. generator : The working of an a.c. generator is based on the principle of electromagnetic induction. When a closed coil is rotated in a uniform magnetic field with its axis perpendicular to the magnetic field, the magnetic flux linked with the coil changes and an induced emf and hence a current is set up in it.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) Let N = number of turns in the coil
           <br/>
           A = Area of face of each turn
           <br/>
           B = magnitude of the magnetic field
           <br/>
           θ = angle which normal to the coil makes with field B at any instant
           <br/>
           ω = the angular velocity with which coil rotates
           <br/>

<br/>
           The magnetic flux linked with the coil at any instant f will be,
           <br/>
           ϕ = NAB cos θ = NAB cos ωt

           <br/>
           (a) Principle of A.C. generator : The working of an a.c. generator is based on the principle of electromagnetic induction. When a closed coil is rotated in a uniform magnetic field with its axis perpendicular to the magnetic field, the magnetic flux linked with the coil changes and an induced emf and hence a current is set up in it.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) Let N = number of turns in the coil
           <br/>
           A = Area of face of each turn
           <br/>
           B = magnitude of the magnetic field
           <br/>
           θ = angle which normal to the coil makes with field B at any instant
           <br/>
           ω = the angular velocity with which coil rotates

           Question 65.
           <br/>
           Draw a schematic diagram of a step-up transformer. Explain its working principle. Deduce the expression for the secondary to primary voltage in terms of the number of turns in the two coils. In an ideal transformer, how is this ratio related to the currents in the two coils? How is the transformer used in large scale transmission and distribution of electrical energy over long distances? (All India 2010)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A transformer is an electrical device for converting an alternating current at low voltages into that at high voltage or vice versa.
           <br/>
           If it increases the input voltage, it is called step- up-transformer.

           Principle : It works on the principle of mutual induction i.e., “when a changing current is passed through one of the two inductively coupled coils, an induced emf is set up in the other coil.”
          </p>
<p>
           Working : As the alternating current flows through the primary, it generates an alternating magnetic flux in the core which also passes through the secondary. This changing flux sets up an induced emf in the secondary, also a self- induced emf in the primary. If there is no leakage of magnetic flux, then flux linked with each turn of the primary will be equal to that linked with each turn of the secondary.

<ol>
<li>
            The primary resistance and current are small.

           <br/>
           The output voltage is greater than the input voltage.
          </p>
<p>
           Main assumptions :
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            The primary resistance and current are small.
           </li>
<li>
            The same flux links both with the primary and secondary windings as the flux leakage from due core is negligible (small).
           </li>
<li>
            The terminals of the secondary are open or the current taken from it, is small, (any two)
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           For long distance transmission, the voltage output of the generator is stepped-up (so that current is reduced and consequently, IR loss is reduced). It is transmitted over long distance and is stepped- down at distributing substations at consumers’ end.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Two sources of energy loss in a transformer:
           <br/>
           1. Copper loss”: Some energy is lost due to heating of copper wires used in the primary and secondary windings. This power loss (= I
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
           R) can be minimised by using thick copper wires of low resistance.
          </p>
<p>
           2. Eddy current loss : The alternating magnetic flux induces eddy currents in the iron core which leads to some energy loss in the form of heat. This loss can be reduced by using laminated iron core.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) No, a step up transformer does not violate law of conservation of energy because whatever is gained in voltage ratio is lost in the current ratio and vice-versa. It steps up the voltage while it steps down the current.

           The antenna of a radio accepts signals from many broadcasting stations. The signals picked up in the antenna acts as a source in the tuning circuit of the radio, so the circuit can be driven at many frequencies. But to hear one particular radio station, we tune the radio. In tuning, we vary the capacitance of a capacitor in the tuning circuit such that the resonant frequency of the circuit becomes nearly equal to the frequency of the radio signal received. When this happens, the amplitude of the current with the frequency of the signal of the . particular radio station in the circuit is maximum.

           Question 68.
           <br/>
           State the working of a.c. generator with the help of a labelled diagram.
           <br/>
           The coil of an a.c. generator having N turns, each of area A, is rotated with a constant angular velocity to. Deduce the expression for the alternating emf generated in the coil.
           <br/>
           What is the source of energy generation in this device? (All India 2011)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           AC generator: A dynamo or generator is a device which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. It is based on the principal of electromagnetic energy into electrical energy. It is based on the principle of electromagnetic induction.
           <br/>
           Construction : It consists of the four main parts :
           <br/>
           (i) Field Magnet : It produces the magnetic field. In the case of a low power dynamo, the magnetic field is generated by a permanent magnet, while in the case of large power dynamo, the magnetic field is produced by an electromagnet. ;
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Armature : It consists of a large number of turns of insulated wire in the soft iron drum or ring. It can revolve round an axle between the two poles of the field magnet. The drum or ring serves the two purposes :
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            It serves as support to coils and
           </li>
<li>
            It increases the magnetic field due to air core being replaced by an iron core.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           (iii) Slip Rings : The slip rings R
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           and R
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           are the two metal rings to which the ends of armature coil are connected. These rings are fixed to the shaft which rotates the armature coil so that the rings also rotate along with the armature.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) Brushes : These are two flexible metal plates or carbon rods (B
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           and B
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           ) which are fixed and constantly touch the revolving rings. The output current in external load RL is taken through these brushes.
           <br/>
           Working : When the armature coil is rotated in the strong magnetic field, the magnetic flux linked with the coil changes and the current is induced in the coil, its direction being given by Fleming’s right hand rule. Considering the armature to be in vertical position and as it rotates in anticlockwise direction, the wire ab moves upward and cd downward, so that the direction of induced current is shown in fig. In the external circuit, the current flows along B
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           R
           <sub>
            L
           </sub>
           B
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           . The direction of current remains unchanged during the first half turn of armature. During the second half revolution, the wire ab moves downward and cd upward, so the direction of current is reversed and in external circuit it flows along B
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           R
           <sub>
            L
           </sub>
           B
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           . Thus the direction of induced emf and current changes in the external circuit after each half revolution.

<br/>
           Principle : It works on the principle of mutual induction i.e., “when a changing current is passed through one of the two inductively coupled coils, an induced emf is set up in the other coil.”
          </p>
<p>
           Working : As the alternating current flows through the primary, it generates an alternating magnetic flux in the core which also passes through the secondary. This changing flux sets up an induced emf in the secondary, also a self- induced emf in the primary. If there is no leakage of magnetic flux, then flux linked with each turn of the primary will be equal to that linked with each turn of the secondary.

<ol>
<li>
            The primary resistance and current are small.
           </li>
<li>
            The same flux links both with the primary and secondary windings as the flux leakage from due core is negligible (small).

           Question 71.
           <br/>
           (a) Explain with the help of a labelled diagram, the principle and working of a transformer. Deduce the expression for its working formula.
           <br/>
           (b) Name any four causes of energy loss in an actual transformer. (Comptt. All India 2012)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Principle. It is a device which converts high voltage a.c. into low voltage a.c. and vice versa. It is based upon the principle of mutual induction. When alternating current passes through a coil, an induced emf is set up in the neighbouring coil.
           <br/>
           Construction. A transformer consists of two coils of many turns of insulated copper wire wound on a closed laminated iron core. One of the coils known as Primary ‘P’ is connected to A.C. supply. The other coil known as Secondary ‘S’ is connected to the load. Working. When an alternating current passes through the primary, the magnetic flux through the iron core changes which does two things. It produces emf in the primary and an induced emf is also set up in the secondary. If we assume that the resistance of primary is negligible, the back emf will be equal to the voltage applied to the primary.

           (a) Principle of A.C. generator : The working of an a.c. generator is based on the principle of electromagnetic induction.

           <br/>
           (a) Principle of A.C. generator : The working of an a.c. generator is based on the principle of electromagnetic induction. When a closed coil is rotated in a uniform magnetic field with its axis perpendicular to the magnetic field, the magnetic flux linked with the coil changes and an induced emf and hence a current is set up in it.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A transformer is an electrical device for converting an alternating current at low voltages into that at high voltage or vice versa.
           <br/>
           If it increases the input voltage, it is called step- up-transformer.

<br/>
           Principle : It works on the principle of mutual induction i.e., “when a changing current is passed through one of the two inductively coupled coils, an induced emf is set up in the other coil.”
          </p>
<p>
           Working : As the alternating current flows through the primary, it generates an alternating magnetic flux in the core which also passes through the secondary. This changing flux sets up an induced emf in the secondary, also a self- induced emf in the primary. If there is no leakage of magnetic flux, then flux linked with each turn of the primary will be equal to that linked with each turn of the secondary.

           (i) (a) Principle. It is a device which converts high voltage a.c. into low voltage a.c. and vice versa. It is based upon the principle of mutual induction. When alternating current passes through a coil, an induced emf is set up in the neighbouring coil.
          </p>
<p>
           Construction. A transformer consists of two coils of many turns of insulated copper wire wound on a closed laminated iron core. One of the coils known as Primary ‘P’ is connected to A.C. supply. The other coil known as Secondary ‘S’ is connected to the load. Working. When an alternating current passes through the primary, the magnetic flux through the iron core changes which does two things. It produces emf in the primary and an induced emf is also set up in the secondary. If we assume that the resistance of primary is negligible, the back emf will be equal to the voltage applied to the primary.

           (a) Draw a labelled diagram of a step-up transformer. Obtain the ratio of secondary to primary voltage in terms of number of turns and currents in the two coils.
           <br/>
           (b) A power transmission line feeds input power at 2200 V to a step-down transformer with its primary windings having 3000 turns. Find the number of turns in the secondary to get the power output at 220 V. (Delhi 2017)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) A transformer is an electrical device for converting an alternating current at low voltages into that at high voltage or vice versa.
           <br/>
           If it increases the input voltage, it is called step- up-transformer.

<br/>
           Principle : It works on the principle of mutual induction i.e., “when a changing current is passed through one of the two inductively coupled coils, an induced emf is set up in the other coil.”
          </p>
<p>
           Working : As the alternating current flows through the primary, it generates an alternating magnetic flux in the core which also passes through the secondary. This changing flux sets up an induced emf in the secondary, also a self- induced emf in the primary. If there is no leakage of magnetic flux, then flux linked with each turn of the primary will be equal to that linked with each turn of the secondary.

            The primary resistance and current are small.

<li>
