           </li>
<li>
            But more income is not the only thing that people desire. They also want to enjoy equal treatment, freedom, security and respect of others. They resent discrimination. All these are important goals.
           </li>
<li>
            In some instances, more income or more consumption becomes less significant than these goals because money can buy material goods only and there are some non-material things important to live.
           </li>
<li>
            Money or material thing is one factor on which our life depends. But non-material things also affect the quality of our life.

           Question 30.
           <br/>
           Who hosted Vienna Congress in 1815? Analyse the main changes brought by the Vienna Treaty.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Who was Giuseppe Mazzim? Why did his visions frighten the conservatives?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In 1815, major European powers-Britain, Russia, Prussia, and Austria who jointly defeated Napoleon, assembled at the Vienna Congress. The Austrian Chancellor, Duke Metternich hosted the Vienna Congress. The representatives concluded the treaty, which brought about the following changes:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            The Bourbon Dynasty that was deposed during the French Revolution was reinstated.
           </li>
<li>
            France lost all the territories it had captured and annexed under the reign of Napoleon.
           </li>
<li>
            An array of states was established on the fringes of France to restrict expansionist policies of France in future.
           </li>
<li>
            Prussia was granted important new territories on its western frontiers. At the other end of the spectrum, Northern Italy was ceded to Austria.
           </li>
<li>
            In the east, Russia was granted a part of Poland, and Prussia was given the portions of Saxony.
           </li>
<li>
            The main intention was to reinstate the monarchies that had been toppled by Napoleon and to create a new conservative order in Europe.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           OR
           <br/>
           Giuseppe Mazzini was an Italian revolutionary:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            He was born in Genoa in 1807. He became a member of the secret society of the Carbonari. In 1831, at the age of 24, he attempted a revolution in Liguria. For this, he was sent into exile.
           </li>
<li>
            Being underground he founded two more societies namely Young Italy in Marseilles and Young Europe in Berne. Their members included like-minded young men from Poland, France, Italy, and the German states.
           </li>
<li>
            According to Mazzini, God had planned nations to be the natural units of mankind. Thus, Italy could not remain divided in small states and kingdoms. It had to become a single unified republic within a wider alliance of nations. Italian could attain its liberty on the name of its unification only.
           </li>
<li>
            His model was adopted in different countries like Germany, France, Switzerland, and Poland, and secret societies were set up in these countries. Mazzini persistently opposed the monarchy. Conservatives used to be frightened by his vision of democratic republics. This was the reason why. Metternich described him as ‘the most dangerous enemy of our social order.’
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Question 31.
           <br/>
           Explain the term ‘Conserytism’ with special reference to Europe. (5)
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Analyze the measures and practices introduced by the French revolutionaries to create a sense of collective identity amongst
           <br/>
           the French people. (5)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Conservatism was a political philosophy that stressed the importance of tradition, established institutions and customs, and preferred gradual development to quick change. After the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, European governments were driven by conservatism.
          </p>
<p>
           Conservatives were people who believed that established traditional institutions of state and society like the monarchy church, social hierarchies, property, and the family should be preserved. But after the rule of Napoleon, the basic ideas of conservatism were changed. Most conservatives did not want to return to the society of pre-revolutionary days. They realised that the changes initiated by Napoleon strengthened traditional institutions like the monarchy in reality.
          </p>
<p>
           They understood that a modem army, an efficient bureaucracy, a dynamic economy. the abolition of feudalism and serfdom could strengthen the autocratic monarchies in Europe. Thus, the conservatives of that time accepted the changes which were in favour of their interests.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Some of the measures and practices introduced by the French revolutionaries to create a sense of collective identify among the French people were as follows
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Union of People The idea of la patrie (the fatherland) and le citoyen (the citizen) emphasized the idea of united people enjoying equal rights under a Constitution.
           </li>
<li>
            New Flag A new French flag, the tricolour, was chosen to replace the former royal standard.
           </li>
<li>
            National Assembly The Estates General was elected by the active citizens and renamed as the National Assembly.
           </li>
<li>
            Patriots Honoured New hymns were composed, oaths taken and martyrs commemorated in the name of the nation.
           </li>
<li>
            Centralised Administration A centralised administrative system was put in place and it formulated uniform laws for all citizens within its territory.
           </li>

           Question 32.
           <br/>
           What is manufacturing? How is the manufacturing industry important for India?
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           How are manufacturing industry classified based on capital investment, ownership and bulk weight of raw material and finished goods?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Manufacturing is the production of goods in large quantities after processing raw materials into more valuable products. The manufacturing sector is considered the backbone of development particularly in general and economic development because:
           <br/>
           (i) Manufacturing industries not only help in modernizing agriculture, which forms the backbone of our economy but they also reduce the heavy dependence of people on agricultural income by providing them jobs in secondary and tertiary sectors.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Industrial development is a precondition for the eradication of unemployment and poverty from our country. This was the main philosophy behind the set-up of public sector industries and joint sector ventures in India. It was also aimed at bringing down regional disparities by establishing industries in tribal and backward areas.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Export of manufactured goods expands trade and commerce and brings in much-needed foreign exchange.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) Countries that transform their raw materials into a wide variety of finished goods of higher value are prosperous. India’s prosperity lies in increasing and diversifying its manufacturing industries as quickly as possible.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           The manufacturing industry is classified on the basis of capital investment, ownership, and bulk, the weight of raw material and finished goods as follows:
           <br/>
           (i) based on capital investment:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Small-scale industries: These industries come under the maximum investment allowed on the assets of a unit by the government. This investment limit keeps changing over time. At present the maximum investment allowed is rupees one crore.
           </li>
<li>
            Large-scale industries: Industries having investments beyond the number of rupees one crore are considered to be a large-scale industry, for example, the iron and steel industry.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           (ii) based on ownership:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Public sector industries: These industries are owned and operated by government agencies, e.g., BHEL, SAIL, etc.
           </li>
<li>
            Private sector industries: These industries are owned and operated by individuals or a group of individuals, e.g., TISCO, Bajaj Auto Ltd., and Dabur Industries.
           </li>
<li>
            Joint sector industries: These industries are jointly run by the state and individuals or a group of individuals, e.g., Oil India Ltd. (OIL) is jointly owned by the public and private sectors.
           </li>
<li>
            Cooperative sector industries: These industries are owned and operated by the producers or suppliers of raw materials, workers, or both. They collectively arrange resources and share the profits or losses proportionately, e.g., the sugar industry in Maharashtra, and the coir industry in Kerala.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           (iii) Based on the bulk and weight of raw material and finished goods:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Heavy industries: These industries manufacture bulky products, e.g., iron and steel.
           </li>
<li>
            Light industries: These industries use light raw materials and produce light goods, e.g., electrical goods industries.

           From the early nineteenth century, there were intense debates around religious issues. Different groups confronted the changes happening within colonial society in different ways and offered a variety of new interpretations of the beliefs of different religions. Some criticized existing practices and campaigned for reform, while others countered the arguments of reformers. These debates were carried out in public and in print.

           <br/>
           Planning is the widely accepted strategy for judicious use of resources. It has importance in a country like India, which has enormous diversity in the availability of resources. There are regions which are rich in certain types of resources but are deficient in some other resources. There are some regions which can be considered self-sufficient in terms of the availability of resources and there are some regions which have acute shortages of some vital resources. For example, the states of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Madhya Pradesh are rich in minerals and coal deposits. Arunachal Pradesh has an abundance of water resources but lacks infrastructural development.
           <br/>
           (i) State how the optimum utilization of resources can be done by planning. (1)

            Some regions can be considered self-sufficient in terms of the availability of resources, and some regions have acute shortages of some vital resources
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           (iii) India has resource availability which can be seen by the following examples The states of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Madhya Pradesh are rich in minerals and coal deposits. Arunachal Pradesh has an abundance of water resources.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 36.
           <br/>
           Read the given extract and answer the following questions.
           <br/>
           Boys and girls are brought up to believe that the main responsibility of women is housework and bringing up children. This is reflected in a Sexual Division of Labour in most families; women do all the work inside the home such as cooking, cleaning, washing clothes, tailoring, looking after children, etc., and men do all the work outside the home. It is not that men cannot do housework; they simply think that it is for women to attend to these things. When these jobs are paid for, men are ready to take up these works, Most tailors or cooks in hotels are men. Similarly, it is not that women do not work outside their home.
          </p>
<p>
           In villages, women fetch water, collect fuel aid work in fields. In urban areas, poor women work as domestic helpers in middle-class homes, while middle-class women work in offices. The majority of women do some sort of paid work in addition to domestic labour. But their work is not valued and does not get recognition.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 36.1
           <br/>
           “Our society is still a male-dominated patriarchal society”. Give an example to support the statement.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In India, the literacy rate among women is only 54% compared to 76% among men. A smaller proportion of female students go for higher education. This is because parents prefer to spend their resources on their boys’ education rather than spending equally on their sons and daughters.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 36.2
           <br/>
           How does the Indian Constitution ensure equal representation for women?
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            The Equal Wages Act provides that equal wages should be paid to equal work.
           </li>
<li>
            One-third of seats in local government bodies – in panchayats and municipalities are reserved for women.
           </li>
