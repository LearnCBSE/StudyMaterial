           Question 11.
           <br/>
           What is Ganga Action Plan? When and why was it launched?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The plan to save the river Ganga was launched in 1985 is called the Ganga Action Plan. It was aimed to reduce the pollution levels in the river. Recent study by WWF – World wide fund for nature have found that Ganga is one of the most endangered rivers in the world. Large quantities of garbage, untreated sewage, dead bodies and many other harmful things are thrown directly into the river. The river is almost dead at many places where the pollution level is very high and the aquatic life cannot survive.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 12.
           <br/>
           Name any four pollutants which cause water pollution. State any three ways of controlling water pollution.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The harmful substances like sewage, toxic materials, silt etc., when gets mixed with water, causes water pollution. The pollutants which cause water pollution are:
           <br/>
           Chemical waste from industries, sewage, silt, agricultural chemicals and garbage thrown into water.
           <br/>
           Water pollution can be controlled in the following ways:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Water should go through the sewage treatment plants before discharging into the water bodies.
           </li>
<li>
            Use of pesticides and weedicides should be limited in order to prevent pollution.
           </li>
<li>
            Industrial waste should be treated for harmful chemicals before discharging into the water bodies. Water treatment plants should be installed in all the industrial areas.
           </li>
<li>
            We should save water consciously and should prevent the wastage of water. We must reuse, recycle and reduce the usage of water. We must try to reuse water. For example, water used for washing vegetables can be used to water plants in the garden.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Question 13.
           <br/>
           How do industries cause water pollution?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Industries cause water pollution in the following ways:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Industries such as oil refineries, paper factories, textile and sugar mills and chemical factories discharge harmful chemicals into rivers and streams. These chemicals include arsenic, lead and flourides which are very toxic to plants and animals
           </li>
<li>
            The soil is also affected by impure water which causes changes in acidity of soil and affects the growth of worms and plants etc.
           </li>
<li>
            Some industries and power plants releases hot water into the rivers. Hot water can also be considered as a pollutant. It raises the temperature of the water body and adversely affects the plants and animals living in it.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Question 14.
           <br/>
           How can you help reduce air pollution at the individual level?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Pollution is not a distant phenomenon anymore. It is affecting the quality of our day to day lives. We must realize our responsibility and should start using the following environment- friendly processes:
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<ol>
<li>
            We should switch to cleaner fuels like CNG- Compressed natural gas and LPG- Liquified petroleum gas for both industries and automobiles.
           </li>
<li>
            Automobiles should also use unleaded petrol.
           </li>
<li>
            We should plant more trees which will help to control deforestation.
           </li>
<li>
            Industrial waste should be treated for harmful chemicals before discharging into air the water bodies.
           </li>
<li>
            We must switch to alternative fuels instead of fossil fuels. Alternative sources of energy can be solar energy, hydropower and wind energy.
           </li>
<li>
            We must encourage the use a public transport, a bicycle or walking for short distances. This will help to reduce the use of fossil fuels.
           </li>
<li>
            Burning of plant waste also causes pollution by the emission of smoke. Plant waste must be put in a compost rather than burning.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Question 15.
           <br/>
           Explain the difference between pure air and polluted air.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Pure air is a mixture of several gases that are invisible and odorless. It consists about 78% nitrogen, 21% is oxygen and less than 1% of Carbon dioxide and other gases like argon, methane and ozone and varying amount of water vapors. Polluted air on the other hand, is contaminated with the substances like smoke, dust and other harmful substances called pollutants. These pollutants can come from natural sources like smoke and dust arising from forest fires or volcanic eruptions. Pollutants can also be added from human activities. The sources of air pollution are automobile exhausts, power plants, factories and burning of firewood and dung cakes.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 16.
           <br/>
           What is ‘greenhouse effect’? State its importance for us.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The sun’s rays warms the surface of earth. A part of the radiation which falls on the earth is reflected back into the space and only a part of it is absorbed. This trapped radiation further warms the earth. The trapping of radiation by the earth’s atmosphere is known as Greenhouse effect. Life would not have been possible without this process. Carbon dioxide is one of the gases responsible for this effect. Some other gases like methane, nitrous oxide and water vapors also contribute towards this process.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 17.
           <br/>
           Name two greenhouse gases? Which one of them produces the maximum greenhouse effect?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The trapping of radiation by the earth’s atmosphere is known as Greenhouse effect. Life would not have been possible without this process. Carbon dioxide and methane are greenhouse gases. Carbon dioxide produces the maximum greenhouse effect.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 18.
           <br/>
           What depletes the ozone layer in the atmosphere? What are the harmful effects of the depletion of ozone layer on us?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Chlorofluorocarbons used in refrigerators, air conditioners and aerosol sprays are responsible to deplete the ozone layer in the atmosphere. Ozone layer protects us from harmful ultraviolet rays of the sun. There has been a depletion of ozone layer in the layers of atmosphere which has been caused by the chlorofluorocarbons and other atmospheric pollutants. This results in increase of ultraviolet radiations at ground level which gives rise to an increased risk of skin cancer.

           Question 46.
           <br/>
           The farmers use large amounts of a substance P in the fields to increase the crop yield. The excess of P dissolves in water and runs into a lake. The substance P causes rapid growth of tiny green water plants Q in the lake which cover the whole lake like a green sheet. When the plants Q die, the organisms called R decompose them by utilizing S dissolved in lake water. The amount of dissolved Sin water decreases too much due to which the fish living in lake suffocate and die. What are P, Q, R and S?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The substance P is Fertilizer. The fertilizers act as nutrients for the algae to grow. When these algae die, they act as a nutrient for decomposers like bacteria. As a result of this process, a lot of oxygen in the water gets used up and leads to the deficiency of Oxygen in the water. This may kill the aquatic organisms.

           Question 49.
           <br/>
           State one way in which the air pollution caused by the burning of fossil fuels in transport and industry can kill the fish living in a lake and one way in which the water pollution caused by an agricultural activity can kill fish living in the same lake.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Fossil fuels burn in the air to produce gases such as Sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. Sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide which reacts with water vapors in the atmosphere to form sulphuric acid and nitric acid. These acids combine with rain and makes the rain water acidic. This is called Acid rain. Acid rain caused by the burning of fossil fuels makes the lake water too much acidic which kills the fish.

           Question 50.
           <br/>
           The incomplete combustion of firewood in homes produces a very poisonous gas X. When inhaled, gas X combines with the substance Y present in blood and reduces the capacity of blood to carry gas Z causing respiratory problems and suffocation. What are X, Y and Z?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The incomplete combustion of firewood in homes produces a very poisonous gas X which is known as Carbon monoxide. When inhaled, Carbon monoxide combines with the substance Y known as Haemoglobin which is present in blood. Carbon monoxide combines with the haemoglobin of our blood. It reduces the oxygen carrying capacity of blood causing respiratory problems and suffocation. Hence, the substance Z is Oxygen.
