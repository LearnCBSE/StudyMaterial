           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below: [8]
           <br/>
           Kausani is situated at a height of 6,075 feet in the Central Himalayas. It is an unusually attractive little town. It covers just about 5.2 sq. kms. It lies to the north of Almora in Uttarakhand’s picturesque Kumaon region. Kausani provides the 300-km wide breathtaking view of the Himalayas. It is the most striking aspect of this place. Snow-capped peaks are spread in a stately row. They stare at you in silvery white majesty. The most famous peak on view in Nanda Devi, the second highest mountain in India. It is situated at a height of 25,645 feet and 36 miles away as the crow files. The other famous peaks on view are Choukhamba (23,420 feet) and Trishul (23,360 feet). Then there are also Nilkanth, Nandaghunti, Nandaghat and Nandakot. On a clear day, the blue of the sky makes a splendid background to these peaks. At sunrise and at sunset, when the colour changes to a golden orange, the scene gets etched in your memory.

           When Gandhiji visited this place in 1929, its scenic beauty held him spellbound. He named it the ‘Switzerland of India’. He prolonged his two-day stay to fourteen days, making time to write a book, ‘Anashakti Yoga’. The place where he was staying was originally a guest-house of the tea estate. It was renamed ‘Anashakti Ashram’ after the book.
          </p>
<p>
           Kausani in the birthplace of Sumitranandan Pant, India’s poet laureate. Its natural surroundings inspired many of his poems. Its tea gardens mingle with dense pine forests and fruit orchards. The area is also host to many fairs and religious ceremonies. If Uttaranchal is the abode of gods, Kausani is God’s own backyard. There is no traffic, no one is in a hurry. If serenity could be put on a canvas, the picture would resemble Kausani.
           <br/>
           On the basis of your reading of the above passage, answer the following questions : [1 × 8 = 8]
           <br/>

           <br/>
           (h) Why, do you think, is Kausani known as’ God’s own backyard’?

          </p>
<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below: [12]
           <br/>
           I rested for a moment at the door of Anand Bhawan, on Market Road, where coffee- drinkers and tiffin-eaters sat still at their tables, uttering low moans on seeing me. I wanted to assure them, “Don’t mind me, you hugging the cash box-you are a coward, afraid even to breathe. Go on, count the cash, if that is your pleasure. I just want to watch, that’s all. If my tail trails down to the street, if I am blocking your threshold, it is because, I’m told, I’m eleven feet tip to tail. I can’t help it. I’m not out to kill—I’m too full. I found a green pasture full of food on my way. I won’t attack until I feel hungry again. Tigers attack only when they feel hungry, unlike human beings who slaughter one another without purpose or hunger.”
          </p>

</div>
<p>
           To the great delight of children, schools were being hurriedly closed. Children of all ages and sizes were running helter-skelter, screaming joyously, “No school, no school, Tiger, tiger!” They were shouting and laughing and even enjoying being scared. They seemed to welcome me. I felt like joining them. So I bounded away from the restaurant door. I walked along with them, at which they cried, “The tiger is coming to eat us; let us get back to school!”
          </p>
<p>
           I followed them through their school gate while they ran up and shut themselves in the school hall securely. I climbed up the steps of the school, saw an open door at the far end of a veranda, and walked in. It happened to be the headmaster’s room. I noticed a very dignified man jumping on the table and heaving himself up into an attic. I walked in and flung myself on the cool floor, having a special liking for cool stone floors.
           <br/>
           As I drowsed, I was aware of cautious steps and hushed voices all around. I was in no mood to bother about anything. All I wanted was a little moment of sleep; the daylight was very bright.
          </p>
<p>

           Sub : Use of loudspeakers in public places.
           <br/>
           Sir,
           <br/>
           Through the esteemed columns of your newspaper, I would like to highlight on a matter of serious concern — the increasing use of loudspeakers in public places.
           <br/>
           Only yesterday due to the use of the loudspeaker in a jagran in Karolbagh there were severe protests from the other communities. This led to communal tension and the police had to be called in. These loudspeakers disturb our peace, cause noise pollution and discord. Elderly people are not able to sleep and students find it difficult to concentrate on their studies.
           <br/>
           It is time that the government should impose a ban on loudspeakers and even if used, there should be a time limit. I hope that the concerned authority will look into it immediately.
           <br/>
           Your truly,
           <br/>
           Anjana /Arjun.

           FLOODS – CAUSES &amp; PREVENTION
           <br/>
           By Aman/Anita
           <br/>
           Nature’s fury strikes at the most unlikely places and the unlikeliest time. It really is a mystery and catches people unaware, even at times when they are sleeping.
           <br/>
           Jammu and Kashmir had the record rainfall this year. Being a mountainous region the effect was very extensive. There was flooding and sudden landslides. People were caught unaware. Houses collapsed with the effect and people were left homeless. The few relief camps did not have enough facilities for the growing number of homeless people. The most affected wre the elderly and the children. Rescue missions were organized. The Air force and the navy swing into action. They rescued many people who were buried in the debris.
          </p>
<p>
           The causes for this catastrophic were manifold. Such drastic weather changes occured due to of global warming and massive deforestation which is the result of urbanization. Construction over water bodies and commercialization were also reasons which could be attributed.
          </p>
<p>
           To control this situation. More trees should be planted. Encroachment of river beds, illegal mining must he banned. More flood warning systems must be put in place. Flow of water must be controlled from dams.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 4.

           <br/>
           Complete a story in 150 – 200 words from the outline given below :
           <br/>
           Birds lived — a forest — one year hot and dry — the king bird suggested to migrate — a greedy sparrow noticed carts with baskets of grain — the sparrow dashed to eat — but warned her friends not to go — owner might kill them — birds scared — the greedy sparrow enjoyed her meal — owner spread a net — was caught.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           HARD WORK YIELDS RICH DIVIDENDS
           <br/>
           I belonged to a humble background having been born in a poor family. The facilities that my parents provided were minimal. We barely had enough to eat.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           My parents worked very hard. They were common labourers. On some days they did not have enough work. They were common daily wage workers. On some days my mother would go hungry after feeding all of us.
          </p>
<p>
           I had an ambition to be an athlete. There were no gyms or racing tracks in my little village. I used to run in the fields, trying to beat all my friends.
           <br/>
           My parents were not very supportive. They believed that I was fostering a wrong ambition. They did not have enough money to support me.
          </p>
<p>
           However, I found a godfather in my PT teacher. He encouraged me and also enrolled me in a training camp. I had to travel 20 miles to reach there but I did not get worried, with gradual hard work and preseverance I managed to get a chance to represent my state and afterwards my country in the Asian Games.
          </p>
<p>
           I won a bronze medal which delighted my coaches and teachers. I won it as I was determined to achieve my goal. My hard work had paid off.
           <br/>
           MORAL: Hard work yields rich dividends
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           GREED IS A CURSE
           <br/>
           In a forest lived a family of sparrows. They had a glorious time and a lot of harmony in their house. The weather was beautiful, the rains were seasonal and they had enough to feed themselves with.
          </p>
<p>
           However, one year became particularly hot and dry. The sparrow began to starve. They had no food to eat. Some of the little sparrows even starved to death.
          </p>
<p>
           The king bird suggested that they should migrate to a better forest. All the sparrows concurred with the idea.
           <br/>
           One of the sparrows noticed carts with baskets of grains.This sparrow felt too lazy to fly as she felt the food was fiercely available. The sparrow dashed to eat the grain. However she disallowed her friends saying that the owner might kill them. She was too selfish and enjoyed the meal all alone. The observant owner spread a net and caught the sparrow. Moral: Greed Leads to Death.

           <br/>
           (a) Why did the Buddha choose Banaras to preach his first sermon ?
           <br/>
           (b) Why didn’t Valli want to go to the stall and have a drink ? What does it tell you about her?

           (a) Banaras is a most holy dipping places on the River Ganges, which is usually crowded with pilgrims who come to get a dip thus getting rid of their sorrows and sufferings. Buddha’s aim was to lessen the suffering of human
           <br/>
           (b) Valli had accumulated only sixty paise, which was the cost of her bus ride between her village and the nearest town and did not haW enough money to spend at the stall. This shows that Valli was a firm and decisive little girl.

           (c) Mr. and Mme Loisel had gone to a ball that was attended by the most famous people of the society. Unlike the other rich ladies in their elegant wrap, Mr. Loisel covered Matilda with a modest wrap which was not befitting those belonging to the upper class society and that clashed severely with her elegant costume. Matilda wished to hurry away in order to go unnoticed by the other women who were wrapping themselves in rich furs.
           <br/>
           (d) As a child because of her looks Bholi was always shunned and ignored. She faced a tough childhood and was extremely anxious and timid.

<p>
           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Answer the following question in 80-100 words: [1 × 4 = 4]
           <br/>
           Through ‘The Sermon at Banaras’, the Buddha preached that death is inevitable and we need to overcome the suffering and pain that follows. Based on your reading of the lesson, write how one should cope with the death of a loved one.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Chekov has used humour and exaggeration in the play to comment on courtship, in his times. Illustrate with examples from the lesson, ‘The Proposal.’ Also mention the values, you think, any healthy relationship requires.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Everything we need to achieve has to undergo pain and suffering. We must let go of grief and sorrow and even the fear of death to step out into the world to achieve something. World is afflicted with death and decay nothing is spared and no one can avoid it. If we fear or grieve over the death of our loved one it will not lessen our sorrow nor will the person come back to life in fact we will end up spoiling our own health instead peace of mind.
           <br/>
           Surrendering selfishness and leading a virtuous life is the safest option.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           The Proposal is one of Anton Chekov’s famous plays where he uses humor and exaggeration in the play to provide a commentary on courtship in his times. Chekov, has used several stereotypes that help play their part beautifully in the play. Lomov, Natalya “the shrew’, Chubukov “the hypocrite father” all help in adding humor to the play. Lomov uses exaggerated actions that, sometimes exceeds the limits of common sense like, Lomov gulping down water, putting his hand to the heart or running to the door and staggering out.
          </p>
<p>
           Another interesting aspect of this storytelling is how the story progresses from cordiality to the hurling of insults as seen when Lomov called Chubukov ‘a swindle’ and Chubukov promptly calling Lomov an ‘intriguer’. The elements of exaggeration and absurdity set the tone of ridicule, which mars the elements of love and romance that is intended in the play. The playwright through this pay ironically emphasizes the courtesy, sincerity, love and mutual understanding are the keys to a healthy relationship.
