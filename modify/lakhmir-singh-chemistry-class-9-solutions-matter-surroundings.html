            Solution 1
           </span>
<br/>
           The condition for something to be called matter is that it should occupy space and have mass.

<span style="color: #eb4924;">
            Solution 4
           </span>
<br/>
           The characteristic of matter illustrated by this observation is that the particles of matter have spaces between them.
           <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
            Solution 5
           </span>
<br/>
           This displays that each crystal of Potassium Permanganate must be made up of millions of small particles i.e. particles of matter are very very small.
           <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
            Solution 6
           </span>
<br/>
           This shows that the particles of matter are constantly moving in all direction.
           <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
            Solution 7
           </span>
<br/>
           This displays that the particles of matter attract one another. In case of chalk, the force of attraction between the particles is weak whereas the force of attraction between the particles of iron is very very strong.

           <br/>
           (i) Matter is made up of tiny particles
           <br/>
           (ii) The particles of matter are constantly moving.

           (b) Brownian motion:
           <br/>
           (i) The particles of matter are very, very small.

<br/>
           Robert Brown suspended extremely small pollen grains in water and observed it through a microscope. It was found that pollen grains were moving very rapidly throughout the water in a very irregular way. He also observed that warmer the water, faster the pollen grains move on the surface of water. This phenomenon is known as the ‘Brownian Motion’.
           <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
            Solution 27
           </span>
<br/>
           It shows that each potassium permanganate crystal is made up of millions of small particles and particles of water have spaces between them.
           <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
            Solution 28
           </span>
<br/>
           Both bromine gas and air is made up of tiny moving particles. When a gas jar containing air is inverted over gas jar containing bromine vapour, both bromine and air molecules move and collide with one another and bounce about in all directions due to which we see a uniform red brown colour in both the jars.
           <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
            Solution 29
           </span>
<br/>
           When salt is added to water and stirred, the tiny salt particles break off from each solid salt granule and fill up the spaces available between the particles of water and mix with them.
           <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
            Solution 30
           </span>
<br/>
           Air is a gas whose particles are very far apart and there are very weak forces of attraction between them. Extremely weak forces between particles of air can be overcome easily due to which we can move our hand in air. On the other hand, the particles of a solid plank of wood are very closely packed and there are very strong forces of attraction between the particles of wood. Hence, it needs a huge outside force to overcome the strong inter particle attractions which only a karate expert can apply.
           <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
            Solution 31
           </span>
<br/>
           If two metal blocks are bound together tightly and kept undistributed for a few years, then the particles of one metal are found to have diffused into the other metal.
           <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
            Solution 32
           </span>
<br/>
           The diffusion between solids is a very, very slow process because the particles in solids do not move from their fixed positions.
           <br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
            Solution 33
           </span>
<br/>
           Solids diffuse the slowest as the particles in solids do not move from their fixed positions.
           <br/>
           Gases diffuse the fastest as the particles in gases move very quickly in all directions.

           The heat energy that has to applied to change the state of a substance is called ‘latent heat’. They are of two types:
           <br/>
           (i) Latent heat of fusion and (ii) Latent heat of vaporization.

            Solution 25
           </span>
<br/>
           When a solid is heated, the heat energy makes its particles vibrate more vigorously. At the melting point, the particles of solid have sufficient energy to overcome the strong forces of attraction holding them in fixed positions and break to form small groups of particles. This heat energy is kinetic energy.

           The heat energy supplied to ice during the change of state (at its melting point) is all used up in overcoming (or breaking) the force of attraction between its particles without increasing its kinetic energy. Since the heat (or latent heat) supplied during the change of state does not increase the kinetic energy of the ice cubes, therefore no rise in temperature takes place. The temperature remains constant.

           This is due to the fact that for melting, each kilogram of ice takes its latent heat of 3.34 x 105 joules from the substance and hence cools the substance more effectively. On the other hand, water at 0o cannot take any such latent heat from the substance.

<br/>
           We would place ice in the water to cool it more quickly because the ice takes its latent heat from the water and hence cools it more effectively. On the other hand, if we keep the water on ice then the latent heat would be taken from the surrounding air hence releasing its coolness to the surrounding and not the water.

           Steam causes more severe burns than boiling water because the steam contains more heat, in the form of latent heat, than boiling water. Hence, when steam falls on our skin and condenses to produce water, it gives out 22.5 x 105 Joules per kilogram more heat than boiling water.

           The latent heat of fusion of ice is 3.34 x 105 J/Kg. It means that 3.34x 105 joules of heat is required to change 1 Kg of ice at its melting point of 0oC into water at the same temperature (of 0oC). This means that 1 Kg of ice at 0oC has 3.34 x 105 joules of less heat than 1 kg of water at the same temperature of 0oC.

           Gases can be liquefied by applying pressure and lowering temperature. The temperature needs to be lowered because when the gas is compressed too much, then heat is produced due to compression. Cooling lowers the temperature of the compressed gas and helps in liquefying it.

           There is a lot of space between the particles of a gas. If enough pressure is applied to the gas, it gets highly compressed. The particles of gas get so close together that they start attracting each other sufficiently to form a liquid. And we say that the gas has liquefied.

           Liquids like alcohol, petrol and perfume are volatile (which can change into vapours easily). When we apply alcohol to the back of our hand, we find that it dries up quickly and while it is drying, the hands feel cold. This happens due to the fact that to change from liquid to the vapour state, alcohol requires latent heat of vaporization. The alcohol takes this latent heat of vaporization from the hand due to which the hand loses heat and we feel cold.

           The cooling in a desert room cooler is caused by the evaporation of water. The higher temperature on a hot day increases the rate of evaporation of water, and the dryness of air also increases the rate of evaporation of water. And due to this increased rate of evaporation of water, a desert room cooler works better on a hot and dry day.

           The earthen pot (or matka) has a large number of extremely small pores on its walls. Some of the water kept in the earthen pot continuously keeps seeping through these pores to the outside of the pot. This water evaporates continuously by taking the latent heat of vaporization from the earthen pot and the remaining water. In this way, the earthen pot and remaining water loses heat and gets cooled.

           We should wear cotton clothes in hot summer days because we perspire more through the pores of the skin during such days. Since, sweat is mainly water and cotton clothes are good absorber of water, they absorb the sweat quickly and expose it to the atmosphere for evaporation. The evaporation of sweat from the cotton clothes takes the latent heat of vaporization from our skin hence the skin loses heat and makes us feel cool and comfortable.

           If the hot tea or milk is taken in a cup, then due to the narrow shape of the cup, the surface area of hot tea in the cup is comparatively small. Due to this, the evaporation of hot tea is slow; cooling caused by evaporation is less and hence the hot tea remains appreciably hot for a much longer time. On the other hand, the saucer has a large surface area due to which the tea taken in the saucer evaporates much faster, thus cooling it quickly and making it convenient to sip or drink.

           The presence of water vapour in air can be demonstrated by the following experiment: We take a steel tumbler and put some well crushed ice in it. Allow the steel tumbler to stand undisturbed for about 5 minutes with the ice in it. We would observe that a large number of tiny drops of water appear on the outer surface of the steel tumbler. This happens because the air around the steel tumbler contains water vapour in it. When these water vapour come in contact with the cold, outside surface of steel tumbler, they condense to form tiny drops of liquid.
