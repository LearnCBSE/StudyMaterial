          </h3>
<p>
           No coding not so tough whereas not so easy, it totally depends on the programmer and learner’s logical and creative thinking level. The difficulty level to learn coding techniques will vary around a number of factors. When it comes to kids’ perception, it may be impossible to learn to code easily, but it can be possible if parents teach their kids to code in a fun-learning and finding logic behind the code approaches.
          </p>
<p>
           Practically kids can’t write a piece of code for the addition of two numbers because it may seem tough, but there are many interesting ways that make it easy for them to learn how to code at a young age. For instance, Scratch and Tynker give innovative visual coding languages, which makes coding fun and understandable. For kids, learning any subject in a fun and engaging way will give more results.
          </p>
<p>
           Children will always love to go with the game-based approaches for doing any of the tasks. If parents succeed to teach coding skills in game-based strategies then their kids will find learning to code is easy and fun.
          </p>
<p>
           Some of the proven research-based ways like games, apps, and other kid-centric projects help kids learn computer programming courses in a way that keeps them engaged and also teaches real-world skills. Learning programming for kids has never been easier or more fun if you force them to study or practice. Simply follow the below points on how to teach your kids to learn to code in a game-based strategy with more fun.

           Below we are providing the detailed descriptions for most commonly used best programming languages to learn to code by your kids:
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            1. Scratch:
           </strong>
           Scratch is one of the most visually appealing of all the kid’s programming languages on the list, but the real reason it really shines is in the freedom of expression that it allows its students. The whole idea behind it was to simplify the process of creating animations, designing games, and building interactive stories so that literally anyone could do it from the ground up.
          </p>
<p>
           With Scratch, it’s all about the simplicity that makes kids passionate about coding. The instant satisfaction of dragging and dropping commands and then seeing interactive stories, games, and animations unroll is wildly influential. So, Scratch can be the first best choice for parents to use while teaching your kids to learn to code.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            2. JavaScript:
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           JavaScript is also one of the great options for children because almost now all the apps and websites are running on this coding language. Some of the main browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer use JavaScript language as a primary option among all coding languages. If your children master this Javascript language, they’ll learn how to change simple web documents into amazing interactive apps and games. And this is somewhat identical to the combination of PHP and Java languages. If you want to see your kids learn coding in an excellent way then javascript can be at your choice list.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            3. Lua:
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           The best scripting language that is excellent for learning text-based coding by kids is Lua. It is simple to learn, use, and set into applications. If you are looking for a free, elegant, powerful, portable, embeddable, and beginner-friendly coding language, then my choice would be a Lua. And also you should know the best thing about this Lua before choosing any other language is that it takes care of low-level things such as memory management for the user. Lua is similar to Python in the way that it eliminates a number of syntax issues that make coding difficult for kids.
