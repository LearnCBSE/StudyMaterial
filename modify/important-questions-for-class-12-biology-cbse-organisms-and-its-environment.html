<strong>
             Organisms and Populations Important Questions for CBSE Class 12 Biology Organisms and Its Environment
            </strong>
</span>
</h2>
<p>
<strong>
            1.Ecology
           </strong>
           is the branch of biology, which studies the interactions among organisms and their physical (abiotic) environment.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            2.
           </strong>
           The subject ecology is basically concerned with four levels of biological organisation.
           <br/>
           These are given below:
           <br/>
           (i)
           <strong>
            Organism
           </strong>
           Living component of the environment at individual level and is basic unit of ecological hierarchy.
           <br/>
           (ii)
           <strong>
            Population
           </strong>
           The sum total of all individuals of a species in a specific geographical area.
           <br/>
           (iii)
           <strong>
            Communities
           </strong>
           Assemblage of all the populations of different species present in an area that interact among themselves.
           <br/>
           (iv)
           <strong>
            Biome
           </strong>
           It is a large unit, which consists of a major vegetation type, associated fauna in a particular climatic zone. Tropical rainforest, deciduous forest, sea coast, deserts, etc., are the major biomes of India.
           <br/>
<strong>
            NOTE
           </strong>
           Other important terms used in ecology are:
           <br/>
<strong>
            Ecosystem
           </strong>
           Represents, the organisms and their environment in a particular area.
           <br/>
<strong>
            Habitat
           </strong>
           It refers to a specific place or locality delimited by a combination of factors, physical features and barriers where a community dwells.
           <br/>
<strong>
            Niche
           </strong>
           The ecological niche of an organism represents the physical space occupied by it, the resources it utilises and its functional role in the ecological system.
           <br/>
<strong>
            Biosphere
           </strong>
           The surface of earth with all life forms, i.e. union of all ecosystems. It is a highly ordered system.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            3.Environment
           </strong>
           Ecology at organism level deals with how different organisms are adapted to their environment in terms of their survival and reproduction.
           <br/>
           (i)Different biomes are formed due to:                                                                   .
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<ul>
<li>
            annual variations in the intensity and duration of temperature.
           </li>
<li>
            annual variations in precipitation.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           The major biomes of the world are desert, grassland, rainforest and tundra.
           <br/>
<img alt="important-questions-for-class-12-biology-cbse-organisms-and-its-environment-t-13-1" height="347" loading="lazy" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5772/23386331856_334b77bf0f_o.png" width="726"/>
<br/>
           (ii)Regional and local variations within each biome lead to the formation of a wide variety of habitats.
           <br/>
           (iii) Life on earth exists in favourable habitats as well as in extreme and harsh habitats like scorching Rajasthan desert, rain-soaked Meghalaya forests, deep ocean trenches, torrential streams, permafrost polar regions, high mountain tops, boiling thermal springs and stinking compost pits and even in our intestine.
           <br/>
           (iv) The biotic components of a habitat are pathogens, parasites, predators and competitors of the organism with which they interact constantly.
           <br/>
           (v)The key abiotic elements that lead to variations in habitats are:
           <br/>
           (a)Temperature  (b) Water
           <br/>
           (c)Light                (d) Soil.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            4.
           </strong>
           Major abiotic factors are:
           <br/>
           (i)
           <strong>
            Temperature
           </strong>
           is the major abiotic factor, which is most ecologically relevant.
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            There is seasonal variation in average temperature of land.
           </li>
<li>
            It decreases progressively from the equator to the poles and from plain areas to the mountains.
           </li>
<li>
            The range of temperature varies from sub-zero levels in polar areas to &gt;50°C at high altitude in tropical deserts during summer.
           </li>
<li>
            The temperature affects the kinetics of body enzymes and thus, the basal metabolism and other physiological functions of the organism.
           </li>
<li>
            Based on tolerance of temperature range, organisms can be divided as:
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
            Euiythennal
           </strong>
           These can tolerate a wide range of temperature.
           <br/>
<strong>
            Stenothermal
           </strong>
           These can tolerate a narrow range of temperature
           <br/>
           (ii)
           <strong>
            Water
           </strong>
           is the next major important factor without which life cannot exist.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<ul>
<li>
            The productivity and distribution of plants in an environment depends on amount of water available.
           </li>
<li>
            For aquatic organisms, the quality (chemical composition and pH) of water is important.
           </li>
<li>
            Salinity refers to salt concentration (measured in parts per thousand) of water. Salt concentration is less than 5 in land water, 30-35 in sea and more than 100 in some hyper saline lagoons.
           </li>
<li>
            Based on tolerance of range of salinity, organisms can be grouped as:
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
            Euryhaline
           </strong>
           Organisms, which can tolerate a narrow range of salinity.
           <br/>
<strong>
            Stenohaline
           </strong>
           Organisms, which can tolerate a narrow range of salinity.
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Many freshwater animals cannot live for long in seawater and vice versa because of the osmotic problems they would face.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           (iii)
           <strong>
            Light
           </strong>
           is an essential factor for the process of photosynthesis performed by autotrophs.
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Oxygen is released during photosynthesis.
           </li>
<li>
            Many small plants like herbs and shrubs can perform photosynthesis under very low light conditions because they are overshadowed by tall, canopied trees.
           </li>
<li>
            Most of the plants also depend on sunlight to meet their photoperiodic requirement for flowering.
           </li>
<li>
            Light is also important for many animals as they use the diurnal and seasonal variations in light intensity and difration (photoperiod) as cues for timing their foraging, migratory and reproductive activities.
           </li>
<li>
            The UV component of solar radiation is harmful to many organisms. All the colour components of the visible spectrum are not available for marine plants living at different depths of the ocean.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           (iv)Soil The nature and properties of soil vary from place to place. It depends on climate, weathering process and whether soil is transported or sedimentary and how its development occurred.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<ul>
<li>
            The soil composition, grain size and aggregation determine the percolation and water holding capacity of the soils.
           </li>
<li>
            The characteristics like pH, mineral composition and topography determine the vegetation of an area.
           </li>
<li>
            This in turn dictates the type of animals supported.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
            5.Responses to abiotic factors
           </strong>
           determines how organisms can cope or manage with stressful conditions of the habitat.
           <br/>
           (i)During the course of millions of years of their existence, many species would have evolved a relatively constant internal (within the body) environment that permits all biochemical reactions and physiological functions to proceed with maximal efficiency and thus, enhance the overall fitness of the species.
           <br/>
           (ii)The organisms should try to maintain the constancy of its internal environment,i.e.homeostasis, despite of varying external environmental conditions that tend to upset its homeostasis.
           <br/>
           (iii)Human beings can maintain their homeostasis by using artificial means
           <br/>
           (air conditioner in summer and heater in winter).
           <br/>
           (iv)Ways by which other organisms can cope up with environmental changes are given below:
           <br/>
<strong>
            Regulate
           </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
            Some organisms maintain homeostasis by physiological and sometimes behavioural means.
           </li>
<li>
            All birds and mammals and few lower vertebrates and invertebrates are capable of thermoregulation and osmoregulation.
           </li>
<li>
            In mammals, during summer, sweating occurs profusely and the evaporation brings down temperature of the body.
           </li>
<li>
            In mammals, during winter, shivering occurs which is a kind of exercise that produces heat and raises the body temperature.
           </li>
<li>
            Plants, on the other hand, do not have such mechanisms to maintain their internal temperature.
           </li>
</ul>

            About 99% of animals and almost all plants cannot maintain a constant internal environment. Their body temperature changes with the ambient temperature.

            In aquatic organisms, the osmotic concentration of the body fluids change with that of the osmotic concentration of the ambient water. These animals and plants are called

            Thermoregulation is energetically expensive for many organisms. This is specially true for small animals like shrews and humming birds.Heat loss or gain is a function of surface area. Since, smal^animals have a larger surface area relative to their volume, they tend to lose body heat very fast when it is cold outside; they have to expend much energy to generate body heat through metabolism. This is the reason that very small animals are rarely found in polar regions.

            It can be concluded that during the course of evolution, some species have evolved the ability to regulate but only over a limited range of environmental conditions, beyond which they simply conform.

            Under unfavourable conditions bacteria, fungi and lower plants slow down their metabolic rate and forms a thick-walled spore to overcome stressful conditions. These spores germinate under onset of suitable environment.
           </li>
<li>
            In higher plants, seeds and some other reproductive structures serve as means to tide over periods of stress. They reduce their metabolic activity and undergo dormancy.

            Some animals, which fail to migrate might avoid the stress by escaping in time. For example, Bear undergoes

            6.Adaptation
           </strong>
           is any attribute of an organism, i.e. morphological, physiological or behavioural, that enables the organism to survive and reproduce in its habitat. Many adaptations have evolved over a long evolutionary time and are genetically fixed.
           <br/>
           Some examples of adaptations are:
           <br/>
           (i)
           <strong>
            Adaptations in kangaroo rat
           </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
            The kangaroo rat in North American deserts is capable of meeting all its water requirements by internal oxidation of fat (water is a byproduct) in the absence of water.
           </li>
<li>
            It can concentrate its urine, so that minimal volume of water is used to expel excretory products.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           (ii)
           <strong>
            Adaptations in desert plants
           </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
            Many desert plants have a thick cuticle on their leaf surfaces and have their stomata arranged in deep pits to minimise water loss through transpiration.
           </li>
<li>
            They have special photosynthetic pathway (CAM) that enables their stomata to remain closed during day time.
           </li>
<li>
            Some desert plants like Opuntia, have no leaves. They are reduced to spines and photosynthesis occurs in flattened stems.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           (iii)
           <strong>
            Adaptations in mammals
           </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
            Mammals from colder climates generally have shorter ears and limbs to minimise heat loss. This is called Allen’s rule.
           </li>
<li>
            In polar seas, aquatic mammals like seals have a thick layer of fat (blubber) below their skin that acts as an insulator and reduces loss of body heat
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           (iv)Adaptations at high altitudes in humans
           <br/>
           (a)At high altitude places like Rohtang Pass near Manali (&gt; 3500 m) and Mansarovar, in China occupied Tibet, people suffer from altitude sickness.
           <br/>
           (b)Its symptoms are nausea, fatigue and heart palpitations.
           <br/>
           (c)This is because at low atmospheric pressure of high altitudes, body does not get enough oxygen.
           <br/>
           (d)The relief occurs gradually due to acclimatisation.
           <br/>
           (e)The body cope up with this low oxygen stress by
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Increasing red blood cells production.
           </li>
<li>
            Decreasing the binding affinity of haemoglobin.
           </li>
<li>
            Increasing the breathing rate.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           (v) Adaptations in desert lizards (Behavioural response)
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            They absorb heat from the sun when their body temperature drops below the comfort zone.
           </li>
<li>
            They move into shade when the ambient temperature starts increasing.
           </li>
<li>
            Some species burrow into the soil and escape from the above ground heat.
           </li>
</ul>

<br/>
<strong>
            Ans
           </strong>
           .Humming birds are natural habitats of tropics. They have large surface area relative to their volume. So, they tend to lose heat very fast, even when it is cold outside.Penguins live on icebergs (natural habitat). They have less surface area to volume ratio. The lesser the ratio, more effective will be the thermoregulation. Also, they hide in group to escape from cold conditions. Therefore, both of them will not survive if their habitats are reversed

<strong>
            In summers,
           </strong>
           the outside temperature is very high than our body temperature. Due to this, profuse sweating occurs. This causes evaporation and cooling effect on the body.

<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.Adaptation in plants
           </strong>
<br/>
           (i) Thick cuticle on their leaf surface.
           <br/>
           (ii) Stomata are arranged in deep pits (sunken) to minimise water loss through transpiration.
           <br/>
           (iii) Leaves are reduced to spines. The photosynthetic function is carried out by thick, fleshy flattened stems.
           <br/>
<strong>
            Adaptation in animals
           </strong>
<br/>
           (i) Kangaroo rat meets the water requirement through internal oxidation of fat. They concentrate their urine, so that minimum volume of water is excreted.
           <br/>
           (ii) Snails undergo aestivation during summers.
           <br/>
           Organisms either migrate or suspend their metabolic activities when conditions are stressful for short duration.In such conditions, organisms are as follow:
           <br/>
           (i) Moving away from stressful habitat to more favourable area and return to their habitat when stressful period is over. For example, birds from Siberia and other cold countries migrate to Bharatpur Sanctuary of Rajasthan.
           <br/>
           (ii) Hibernating (frogs) or aestivating (snails) or undergo diapause (zooplanktons).
           <br/>
           (iii) Thick-walled spores are formed in stressful conditions and germinate under suitable conditions, e.g. bacteria, fungi and lower groups of plants.

<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           (i)Fungi They produce various kinds of thick-walled spores to survive under unfavourable conditions, which germinate on return of favourable conditions.
           <br/>
           (ii) Zooplanktons They enter diapause, a stage of suspended development under unfavourable conditions.
           <br/>

            31.(i) Explain giving reasons why the tourists visiting Rohtang Pass or Mansarovar are advised to resume normal active life only after a few days of reaching there.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            (ii) It is impossible to find small animals in the polar regions. Give reasons.   [All India 2012]
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           (i)Tourists visiting to Rohtang Pass near Manali (&gt; 3500 m) may suffer from altitude sickness. They resume normal active life only after a week because in low atmospheric pressure at high altitudes, the body does not get enough oxygen. Gradually, the body compensates low oxygen availability by
           <br/>
           (a)Increasing red blood cell production.
           <br/>
           (b)Decreasing the binding affinity of  haemoglobin.
           <br/>
           (c)Increasing the breathing rate.
           <br/>
           (ii)Small animals have a large surface area relative to their volume. So, they tend to lose body heat very fast during cold conditions. They need to spend more energy to generate body heat. Due to this smaller animals are rarely found in polar regions.

<strong>
            32.list the different ways by which organisms cope or manage with abiotic stresses in nature. Explain any three ways.     [All India 2009c]
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans
           </strong>
           .Organisms cope up with abiotic stress by:
           <br/>
           (i)Regulating Some organisms maintain homeostasis by physiological and behavioural means. They are called regulators, e.g.
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            In summers, when outside temperature is more, we sweat profusely that results in evaporative cooling to bring down the body temperature.
           </li>
<li>
            In winters, when temperature is low, we shiver (a kind of exercise) that produces heat and raise the body temperature.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           (ii) Conformating Organisms that cannot maintain a constant internal environment. Their body temperature changes with the ambient temperature. Such animals are called conformers. For example, small animals have larger surface area relative to their volume. They lose body heat very fast in low temperature. So, they expend energy to generate body heat through metabolism for adjusting.
           <br/>
           (iii) Migrating The temporary movement of organisms from the stressful habitat to a more hospitable area and return when favourable conditions reappear is called migration. The long distance migration is very common in birds.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            33.(i) List any four abiotic components that lead to variations in the physical and chemical conditions of habitats.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            (ii) Explain the impact of these components on the distribution of organisms in different habitats.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            [All India 2009 C]
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans
           </strong>
           .(i)Temperature, water, light and soil.
           <br/>
           (ii) (a) Temperature influences the kinetics of enzymes and thereby the metabolism and other physiological functions of the organisms.
           <br/>
           Organisms may be eurythermal and can tolerate a wide range of temperature and stenothermal that can tolerate only a narrow range of temperature.
           <br/>
           (b)Water is important to sustain life and productivity and distribution of plants is dependent on water.
           <br/>
           Freshwater forms cannot thrive in sea water and vice versa.
           <br/>
           (c)Light influences photosynthesis of plants. Light also influences the flowering in plants and timing of foraging, reproduction and migratory activities of animals.
           <br/>
           Aquatic plants occupy different depths depending on their pigments and the light available.
           <br/>
           (d)Soil influences vegetation by the water holding capacity, topography and its composition.
