Nature is powerful source, worshipped, revered and conserved. Human beings ‘ are directly dependent on nature for resources which sustain them. They create possibilities with the resources obtained from the environment. The human actvities create cultural landscape. The imprints of human activities are created everywhere; health resorts on highlands, huge urban sprawls, fields, orchards and pastures in plains and rolling hills, ports on the coasts, oceanic routes on the oceanic surface and satellites in the space. Nature provides opportunities and human beings make use of these and slowly nature gets humanized and starts bearing the imprints of human endeavour.

           “The period from 1901 to 1921 is referred to as a stagment phase of India’s population growth.” Substantiate the statement. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The period from 1901-1921 is referred to as a period of stagnant growth of India’s population, since in this period, growth rate was very low, even recording a negative growth rate during 1911-1921. Both the birth rate and death rate were high keeping the rate of increase in population low.
           <br/>
           Poor health and medical services, illiteracy of people at large and inefficient distribution system of food and other basic necessities were largely responsible for a high birth and death rates in this period.

           Question 11.
           <br/>
           How does intermixing of people from diverse cultures due to migration have positive values ? Explain. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Migration leads to intermixing of people from diverse cultures. It has positive contribution such as evolution of composite culture and breaking through the narrow considerations and widens up the mental horizon of the people at large. It helps to promote national integration, loosens die rigidity in terms of social barriers like caste and religion. Intermixing of people helps in decreasing the social gaps formed between different castes and classes.

           Describe the development of modern towns in India during the British period.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Mughal period observed the development of many cities and towns. About 100 of existing towns have their roots in medieval period. These were well connected with roadways and majorly developed as capitals or headquarters of principalities and kingdoms. There are fort towns. Agra was then the capital and was well connected ‘ with the rest of the country. The other important towns included Delhi, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Lucknow and Nagpur. These towns grew bigger and occupied great significance in terms of administration, trade and manufacturing.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           The British and other Europeans developed a number of towns in India. They first developed some trading ports such as Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Surat, Daman, Goa, Pondicherry, etc. for the ease of trade and commerce. Gradually they established their administrative centres, hill towns as summer resorts etc. Towns based on modern industries also evolved after 1850. For eg., a large number of towns were developed as administrative headquarters, eg., Chandigarh, Bhubaneswar, Gandhinagar, Dispur, etc. and as industial centres such as Durgapur, Bhilai, Sindri, Barauni, etc. Some old towns also developed as satellite towns around metropolitan cities such as Ghaziabad, Rohtak, Gurgaon around Delhi. With increasing investment in rural areas, a large number of medium and small towns have developed all over the country.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           Non conventional energy sources are the only sustainable sources. They are renewable resources like Solar, Wind, Hydro-Geothermal and Biomass. These energy resources are more equitably distributed. These are environmental friendly and cost-effective in the long run. India has huge prospect in the production of such resources that will provide sustained and environmental friendly energy in the future :
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            The large expanse of deserts and the coastlines are an ideal site for the generation of wind energy. The largest wind farm cluster in India is located in Tamilnadu.
           </li>
<li>
            Bio gas is an important non conventional energy resource in rural areas. Shrubs, animal and agricultural wastes are used to produce biogas. The use of biogas for domestic consumption in rural areas can reduce the burning of fuel wood and thus reduce the feeling of trees.
           </li>
<li>
            The long coastline of India is an ideal site for the generation of tidal energy. It can be used for generation of electricity which is non- polluting and a sustainable source of energy.

           According to Grierson (Linguisti Survey in India, 1903-1928) there were 179 languages and as many as 544 dialects in the country. In the context of modern India, there are many scheduled languges (22) and a number of non-scheduled languages. Among the scheduled languages, the speakers of Hindi have the highest percentage (40.42). The smallest language groups are Kashmiri and Sanskrit speakers (0.01 per cent each). These variation of languages in India, makes it a land-linguistic diversity.

           <br/>
           way by which the population size changes.” Justify the statement. [1 × 3=3]
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           “Technological advancement helped in the reduction of birth rate, but population growth remained high.” Justify the statement.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Apart from birth and death rates, migration plays a vital role in population since change. When people move from one place (place of origin) to another place (place of destination), it eventually affects the population size of the particular region. The place of origin shows a decrease in population while the population increases in the place of destination. Hence, migration effects the population size of particular region.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Reasons for high population growth are as follows :
          </p>
<ol>

           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Gross National Happiness is used as a tool to measure a county’s progress. The material and technological developments are approached more cautiously taking into consideration the possible harm they might bring to the environment and the other aspects of cultural and spiritual life of the people of a country. Material progress cannot be attained at the cost of happiness. The main objective of Gross National Happiness is to think spiritually about non-materialistic and qualitative aspects of development.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           Human beings pollute the water through industrial, agricultural and cultural activities. Among these activities, industry is the most significant contributor.
          </p>
<p>
           Industries produce several undesirable products including industrial wastes, polluted waste water, chemical residuals, numerous heavy metals, etc. Most of the industrial wastes are disposed off in running water or lakes. Consequently, poisonous elements reach the reservoirs, rivers and other water bodies, which destroy the bio-system of these waters. Major water polluting industries are leather, pulp and paper, textiles and chemicals.
          </p>
<p>
           Various types of chemicals used in modern agriculture such as inorganic fertilisers, pesticides and herbicides are also pollution generating compounds. These chemicals are washed down into rivers, lakes and tanks. These chemicals also infiltrate the soil to reach the groundwater. Fertiliser includes an increase in the nitrate content of surface waters.

          </h3>
<p>
           Note : Except for the following questions, all the remaining questions have been asked in previous set.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           How does age-sex pyramid project declining trend in population ? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Age Sex pyramid projects trend in population by a figure which is narrower at the base showing low birth rates and tapered at the top showing low death rates. This shows declining trend in population.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Examine the concept of ‘income approach’ of human development. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Income approach of Human Development : Human Development is seen as being linked to income. The idea is that the level of income reflects the level of freedom an individual enjoys; higher the level of income, higher is the level of human development.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Why does the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of a country not fully reflect the quality of life of the country ? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Gross Domestic Product or GDP of a country not fully reflects the quality of life of the country as there is still the prevalence of gap between rich and poor.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 10.
           <br/>
           “The period from 1951 to 1981 is referred to as a phase of population explosion in India.” Substandiate the statement. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The decades 1951-1981 are referred to as the period of population explosion in India, which was caused by a rapid fall in the mortality rate but a high fertility rate of population in the country. During this period, the population of India grew from 361 million in 1951 to 683 million in 1981. There was a growth of population by 322 million during this phase. This was the phase when both death rate as well as birth rate declined. The average annual growth rate was as high as 2.2 per cent. It is in this period, after the Independence, that development activity was introduced through a centralised planning process and the economy started showing up ensuring the improvement of the living condition of people at large. Consequently, there was a higher growth rate. Besides, increased international migration bringing in Tibetans, Bangladeshis, Nepalis and even people from Pakistan contributed to the high growth rate.

           Question 14.
           <br/>
           Why do people migrate ? Explain the two types of factors that influence migrations in the world. [1 + 2 + 2 = 5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Most people migrate for economic reasons. Cultural and environmental factors also induce migration.
           <br/>
           Push factors ‘push’ people away from their home and include things like war. Pull factors ‘pull’ people to a new home and include things like better opportunities. The reasons people migrate are usually economic, political, cultural or environmental.
           <br/>
           The few types of factors that influence migration in the world :
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            The Pull Factors:
            <br/>
            Pull factors generally attract people towards certain cities and territories.

           Question 15.
           <br/>
           Explain any five important characteristics of ‘mixed farming’ practised in the world. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Mixed farming is a type of agriculture which involves both crops and livestock. Mixed farming yields fairly high agricultural returns because of efficient methods of farming, excellent transport systems, and proximity to the urban markets and rein ability of precipitation.
          </p>
<p>
           The cool-moist summer and comparatively mild- moist winters promote the growth of hay crops and grasses in many undulating tracts and low flatlands. The pastures remain fresh all the year round and large flocks of sheep and herds of cattle are grazed, the five important characteristics of mixed farming practised in the world :
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Equal emphasis is laid on crop cultivation.
           </li>
<li>
            Animals like cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry provide the main income with crops like wheat, barley, oats, maize, fodder, root crops.
           </li>
<li>
            Mixed farms are moderate in size.
           </li>
<li>
            Crop rotation and intercropping maintains soil fertility.
           </li>
<li>
            High capital expenditure on farm machinery and building and skilled and expertised farmers.
           </li>
<li>
            Extensive use of fertilizers and green manures.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Two land use categories which have shown decrease :
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Barren and wasteland.
           </li>
<li>
            Area under pastures and tree crops.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Reasons :
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Barren and wasteland.
            <br/>
            Increasing pressure on land from agriculture and non-agricultural sectors.
           </li>
<li>
            Land under pastures tree crops.
            <br/>
            Decrease due to pressure from agricultural land and illegal encroachment due to cultivation on common pasture lands.
           </li>
</ol>
