           Reading Comprehension Through Unseen Passages
           <br/>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the following text. (10)
           <br/>
           1. Even international students whose first language is English can find themselves struggling to understand an alien academic culture. The problems are very familiar. Students’ first problem is often with listening skills. They may feel nervous about this and it is certainly a steep learning curve. They need a structured listening experience, for instance how to pick out the main ideas. They also need help with academic reading — how to approach an article or book, how to skim, read and make notes.
          </p>
<p>
           2. However, while a student’s confidence in listening skills grows, it is in the area of academic writing where more serious cultural differences become apparent. Much of British education is based on essay writing, but this may be a demanding task for students from other cultures. Suddenly, they are faced with the need to express their own ideas, develop their opinions and evaluate different issues, all in polished English. For some, the concept of originating this kind of written discourse can prove problematic and they may find themselves scoring low marks because of plagiarism or reproducing someone else’s ideas. In Britain, plagiarism is regarded as academic theft, though this is not always the case in other countries. Students are expected to do research in a libraify before tackling an assignment and simply regurgitating lecture notes is also not acceptable.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           3. The best way to overcome these hurdles is to be prepared. The first step is to take a test to assess the English language skills needed to cope with the issues of academic culture.
          </p>
<p>
           4. If an accredited test indicates that a student’s language skills are not sufficient to embark on a university degree, the next step is to consider pre-sessional courses, generally at the university where the student will take a degree. These can last from three weeks to an academic year, so it is wise for students to be realistic about their needs. It is generally accepted that approximately 200 hours of study are needed to improve on one bad score on some tests. Some of the ‘new’ universities that formed from polytechnics in 1992 are experimenting with new styles of pre-sessional and foundation courses. Elspeth Jones, Director of the Centre for Language Study at Leeds Metropolitan University explains, “Our courses are monthly and so students from parts of the world with a different academic year can enrol at any time.”
          </p>
<p>
           5. She feels that language training in new universities is generally more flexible tfian in older institutions. “Universities like ours can take students with lower language test grades and can put them through a programme’that will bring them up to the required standard, though we cannot guarantee how long it will take.”
          </p>

           (i) Select the option that depicts what the writer projects, with reference to the following. (1)
           <br/>
           Much of British education is based on essay writing, but this may be a demanding, task for students from other cultures.
           <br/>
           (a) Concern
           <br/>
           (b) Anguish
           <br/>
           (c) Warning
           <br/>
           (d) Exhilaration
           <br/>

           <br/>
           (a) Concern
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Why is an essay writing a demanding task? (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Essay writing is a demanding task as one needs to research in a library about the topic he/she is going to write an essay on. One cannot rewrite lecture notes and one has to develop ideas and evaluate in order to write an essay.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Complete the following with a phrase from Paragraph 1. (1)
           <br/>

           Answer:
           <br/>
           to understand an alien academic culture.
          </p>
<p>

           <br/>
           (d) Discourse and lecture
           <br/>
           (e) Hurdle and embark
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (b) nervous and confidence
          </p>
<p>
           (v) Complete the sentence appropriately.
           <br/>
           British education is primarily based on ………………… . (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Essay writing, where students need to express their own ideas, develop their opinions and evaluate different issues, all in polished English.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           (vi) What according to the author causes international students to score low marks?
           <br/>
           State any one reason. (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           British education is focused on essay writing. International students who are not accustomed to essay writing then find it difficult to assess, create, and formulate their ideas and opinions. They plagiarise and thus end up scoring low marks.
          </p>
<p>
           (vii) Choose the option that incorrectly states the meaning of ‘accredited’ as used in the passage. (1)
           <br/>
           1. To credit
           <br/>
           2. To thank

           (b) 3 and 4
           <br/>
           (c) 5 and 6
           <br/>
           (d) 3 and 6
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (b) 3 and 4
          </p>
<p>
           (viii) Based on your reading of the text, list any 1 benefit of pre-sessional courses. (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Pre-sessional courses assess and prepare the students who find difficulty in their ongoing courses. They equip them with the necessary skills needed for their course.

<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Read the following text:
           <br/>
           1. Elephant babies like coconut oil. This discovery has saved the lives of hundreds of orphaned, unweaned elephants left behind when their mothers were killed.
          </p>
<p>
           2. The discovery came after two decades of efforts by the renowned conservationist Daphne Sheldrick, who has died aged 83. She devoted most of her life to rescuing young elephants and releasing them back into the wild.
          </p>
<p>
           3. When she first made attempts to keep the orphaned babies alive, often at one or two years old, with other milk sources, they remained malnourished and eventually died. It was only after trying every combination she could find that she hit on one baby milk formula from Europe, which contained coconut oil that seemed to work. She and the elephants never looked back, and now more than 230 elephants in Kenya, and many others in Asia and other parts of Africa, are alive, and mostly in the wild, thanks to her hand-rearing.
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 10 English Set 2 with Solutions 1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-102049" height="251" loading="lazy" src="https://www.cbsetuts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-English-Set-2-with-Solutions-1.png" width="442"/>
<br/>
           4. Her work grew from her care of orphaned elephants found by her husband, David Sheldrick, chief warden at the Tsavo National Park in Kenya in the 1960s. By the time her sanctuary was well-established, in the late 70s and 80s, each elephant had its own stall, as otherwise, they would disturb one another, was bottle-fed every three hours, and was given blankets, raincoats, and sunscreen as needed. A keeper alternatively slept with each animal under a year old, lest the babies grow too dependent.
          </p>
<p>
           5. Often, the elephants arrived traumatised, having experienced the lethal violence and cruelty of poaching. It was crucial, in her view, to recognise their grief and help them to overcome it. “They are emotionally human animals,” she told journalists. “You have to think in human terms. How does a child feel when it has lost its whole family and is suddenly in the hands of the enemy?”
          </p>
<p>
           6. Throughout her life, Sheldrick championed the ability of elephants to communicate and their capacity for feeling. Once, she recounted, a female wrenched the tusks from a newly killed bull elephant and threw them into the jungle, before the eyes of the poachers.
          </p>
<p>

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The statement that when she first made attempts to keep the orphaned babies alive, often at one or two years old, with other milk sources, they remained malnourished and faded into death, is an observed fact because Daphne made an exhaustive observation of the elephant babies’ health.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Justify the following, in about 40 words.
           <br/>
           While the passage presents the predicament of the renowned conservationist Daphne Sheldrick and her continuous efforts to find a correct combination of baby milk formula for saving the poor elephant babies fo their adulthood. what are the other revealing facts that make the reader more inquisitive about elephants?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The fact that elephant babies like coconut oil gave a huge impetus to preserving the lives of elephant babies from malnourishment. The other revealing facts that come out are that elephants are emotionally human animals. The touching part is the last line of the passage “once a female wrenched the tusks from a newly killed bull elephant and threw them into the jungle, before the eyes of the poachers.”
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) List any 2 attempts made by Daphne Sheldrick to keep the orphaned elephant babies alive.

<li>
            Other milk sources.
           </li>
<li>
            Milk formula from Europe, which contained coconut oil.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           (v) In the table given in the passage, in the third paragraph it is stated that “more than 230 elephants in Kenya, and many others in Asia and other parts of Africa, are alive, and mostly in the wild, thanks to her hand – rearing.” What inference can be drawn from this?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           With a slight increase in the population of elephants in 2014, between 2010 and 2018 there has been a stabilisation in the elephant population, which is partly due to the hand-rearing of the renowned conservationist Daphne Sheldrick.
          </p>
<p>
           (vi) Select the chart that appropriately represents the workload of the conservationist Daphne Sheldrick through the given years, as per Paragraph 4.

           Sir/ Ma’am
           <br/>
           With much disappointment, I am constrained to express my displeasure and resentment regarding inferior arrangements made during our tour to Nainital and Shimla from 10th June, 20XX to 19th June, 20XX. The arrangements made by your agency were not proper. We had to face several issues like problems during check-in at the hotel as the staff did not have prior knowledge about our stay. So, we had to wait for them to make arrangements which disturbed our itinerary. Moreover, the hotel had not maintained proper sanitation and hygiene and the food also tasted stale.
          </p>
<p>
           We felt cheated by your agency. As it is, I am expecting a refund of at least half of the amount paid for the tour! I am enclosing a copy of the bill for your reference.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           A.
           <br/>
           Air Pollution – The Deadly Air
           <br/>
           Air pollution is a serious issue affecting our planet today, yet many people continue to turn a blind eye thinking that it’s not that serious. The given graph shows how alarming the issue of air pollution is specifically in this city, Nagpur. Data very evidently shows a significant increase in the air pollution levels of the city. No doubt, the people of Nagpur have been suffering from many respiratory diseases. While in 2000, the air pollution levels were not very low, the quality of air then was way better than the air the subsequent generations are inhaling.
          </p>
<p>
           The years after 2005 leading to 2010 saw a decrease in the levels of Carbon Dioxide in the air. But suddenly after 2010, there was a drastic change. The quality of air was constantly declining and the percentage of carbon dioxide was ever on increase. The level of the gas reached from about 855 to 890. After that, the level of Carbon dioxide saw a slow decline. This decline indicates that there are still a lot of changes that need to be made.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           B. In the modern era, intolerance and anger have risen so enormously that resorting to violence on trivial issues has become commonplace. Many surveys are being conducted after the data regarding the exponential increase in violence was made public. In a survey conducted recently, it has been found that the number of deaths due to violence has increased enormously since the nineties. Death rate in 1000s was 2.5% in 1990. But in 2010, it has increased to 7.5%.
          </p>
<p>
           The data reveals a sad picture. Our culture never promoted violence as an initial solution. The need of the hour, in this light, is to understand the reason behind such intolerance and to find ways to curb any violence.

           <br/>
           Read the given extracts and answer the questions for ANY ONE of the two, given. (5)
           <br/>
           A.
           <br/>
           The way a crow
           <br/>
           Shook down on me
           <br/>
           The dust of snow
           <br/>
           From a hemlock tree
           <br/>
           Has given my heart
           <br/>
           A change of mood
           <br/>
           And saved some part
           <br/>
           Of a day I hid rued. (Dust of Snow)
          </p>
<p>
           (i) Fill in the blank appropriately And saved some part/of a day I had rued’. The poetic device used here is ……………….. . (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           enjambment
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) What was the reaction of poet when the dust of snow fell on him? (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The poet was in a depressed and sorrowful mood. The moment the crow shook the hemlock tree and a dust of snow fell on him, he felt unburdened and relieved.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Rationalise what you think the poet was probably doing when the dust of snow fell on him (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           From the context and the depressed mood of the poem, we can make out that the poet was sad. He was taking a walk or was just standing near the hemlock tree regretting something before the dust of snow fell on him.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) Choose the option showing the reason NOT corresponding with ‘… a crow/shook down on me/The Dust of Snow.’ (1)
           <br/>
           (a) The crow’s landing on the branch of the tree.
           <br/>
           (b) The shivering of the crow, due to the cold.
           <br/>
           (c) The readjustment of the position of the crow on the branch.
           <br/>
           (d) The cawing of the crow is hidden in the foliage.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (d) The cawing of the crow is hidden in the foliage.
          </p>
<p>
           B. The fog comes on little cat feet.
           <br/>
           ft sits looking over harbour and city
           <br/>
           on silent haunches and then moves on.
          </p>
<p>
           (i) Highlight any two characteristics of fog from its description in the poem. (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The fog is a silent and mysterious thing. It enters a city without any warning or sign and leaves just as silently.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) How does the poet compare fog to a cat? (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The poet compares the fog to a cat because of similarity in their movements. The silent steps of a cat and the way it sits by folding its knees are both very similar to the way fog comes and surrounds the city and harbour and looks over it.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Why do you think fog is a free verse poem? (1)
           <br/>
           (a) It has only six lines.
           <br/>
           (b) It has no regular rhyme scheme.
           <br/>
           (c) It is divided in two paragraphs.
           <br/>
           (d) Both (a) and (b)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (b) It has no regular rhyme scheme.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) Comment, in detail, on the significance of the closing phrase of the poem- ‘moves on’. (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The phrase ’moves on’ is crucial to depict the mysterious quality of the fog. It comes and leaves suddenly without being noticed by anyone.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 8.
           <br/>
           Answer ANY FOUR of the following five questions, in about 40-50 words. (4 × 3 =12)
           <br/>
           (i) Why does the postmaster send money to Lencho? Why does he sign the letter’s ‘God’? (A Letter to God) (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When the postmaster reads Lencho’s letter, he realises his firm belief and faith of Lencho in God.
           <br/>
           He does not want his faith to be broken and therefore, he decides to send money to Lencho.
           <br/>
           To maintain Lencho’s faith in God, the postmaster signs the letter as ‘God’ so that Lencho believes that God has helped him.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Would you agree that the ‘depths of oppression’ create ‘heights of character’? How does Mandela illustrate this? (Nelson Mandela-Long Walk to Freedom) (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Yes, I agree that the ’depths of oppression’ creates ‘heights of character’. To illustrate this, Mandela gives the example of many patriots like Oliver Tambos, the Walter Sisulus, Chief Luthulis, Yusuf Dadoos, etc. These freedom fighters emerged due to the extreme oppression faced by the blacks. They had extraordinary courage, wisdom and generosity.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) What does Chubukov at first suspect that Lomov has come for? Is he sincere when he later says ‘And I’ve always loved you, my angel, as if you were my own son”? Find reasons for your answer from the play. (The Proposal) (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           At first, Chubukov suspected that Lomov had come to borrow money.
           <br/>
           Chubukov was not sincere when he told Lomov that he had always loved him and that he was like his own son because he had decided not to give any money to Lomov. If he truly meant what he said he would not have thought of not giving him money. He said so only because Lomov had asked for his daughter’s hand in marriage.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) How does the poem A Tiger in the Zoo point to the cruelty of animals in captivity? (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The poem A Tiger in the Zoo hints at the cruelty of animals in captivity by contrasting the life an animal living in its natural habitat and the zoo. The poet imagines how a tiger attacks a deer near the water hole, terrorises the villagers living on the outskirts and snarls at night. On the contrary, it shows how the same tiger is made to stay in a cramped space for the entertainment of humans.
          </p>
<p>
           (v) A ballad includes the telling of a tale as well as a surprise ending. Using evidence from the poem, explain how these features are included in The Tale of Custard the Dragon. (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Tale of Custard the Dragon tells the story of Custard, who was once considered to be a coward. The dragon is described as very timid by the poet. But on one occasion when a pirate enters Belinda’s house, while everyone else is frightened, Custard tackles him and eats him up. Everyone is saved by him and eventually, everyone recognises his bravery. These instances prove that the poem is a ballad.

           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Answer ANY TWO of the following three questions, in about 40-50 words. (2 × 3 = 6)
           <br/>
           (i) Give any two reasons for Oops breaking into laughter on reading the first nursery rhyme. (The Book that saved the Earth) (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Oop’s breaking into laughter on reading the first nursery rhyme indicates that the vitamins had worked such that Oop was able to understand the meaning behind the nursery rhymes. Because he could understand the rhymes literally, he found the images depicted to be humorous.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) What kind of mother was Ramlal’s wife? (Bholi) (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Ramlal’s wife (Bholi’s mother) was a traditional housewife who believed that daughters should not be educated as it would be difficult to find grooms for them. She neglected Bholi as she was ugly and dumb, and wanted to get rid of her by marrying her off to anyone.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Mme Loisel now knew the horrible life of necessity. Do you think Mme Loisel accepted this change willingly? Give two reasons in support of your answer. (The Necklace) (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Yes, I think Mme. Loisel accepted this change willingly due to the following reasons
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            She understood that to pay the debt, she would have to cut down on her luxuries.
           </li>
<li>
            She learned the work of the kitchen, washed the clothes, brought up the water from the street, and sent away the maid to help save money to pay off the debt.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Answer ANY ONE of the following two questions, in about 100-120 words. (1 × 6 = 6)
           <br/>
           A. Inspired by the diversity in the chapter, ‘Glimpses of India’, you wrote an article for your school magazine on the topic, ‘Diversity-The Uniqueness of India’. Write a paragraph, sharing two key opinions from the article.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           B. Why does the poet not offer money to the boy to buy another ball in The Ball Poem?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A. Diversity-The Uniqueness of India
           <br/>
           by XYZ
           <br/>
           India is a land of different cultures and traditions. No doubt, it’s called the land of Unity in Diversity. Every culture in this land has its uniqueness.
          </p>
<p>
           The geographical and cultural dissimilarities of each region make every place distinct from the other. On one hand, we have the beauty and bravery of Coorg which exemplifies martial bravery, beautiful women, and magnificent landscapes full of flora and fauna.
          </p>
<p>
           On the other, Assam’s geographical features make it appropriate for tea production. In a similar way stands the cultural heritage of the Portuguese in Goa. Every region is identified by its own lifestyle which makes its diversity full of unique combinations.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           B. When a person is trying to overcome his grief on his own, he is busy making himself understand certain things. In such a situation, if someone intrudes or disturbs, the chain of thoughts is broken which irritates the person. Moreover, self-consolation, realization, and understanding are more effective and lasting than when it is done by an external agency or a person.
          </p>
<p>
           These facts are proven in the poem, The Ball Poem’. In the poem, the poet states that neither will he interfere in the boy’s sorrowful mood nor will he offer him any money. He believes that the boy will learn the harsh reality of the loss on his own. Gradually, the boy will learn to cope with loss and move on with his understanding.
          </p>
<p>
           Further, he believes that the offer to buy another ball would be useless because he may get a new ball but he would not be able to get back the memories of his childhood that were attached to it. No other ball can take the place of the old ball of the boy’s childhood. So, the poet does not offer money to the boy to buy another ball.

           Question 11.
           <br/>
           Answer ANY ONE of the following two questions in about 100 – 120 words. (1 × 6 = 6)
           <br/>
           A. Describe the changes the character of Hari Singh undergoes in the story ‘The Thief’s Story’ using the following value points:
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           B. Imagine that Noodle, from The Book that saved the Earth writes a diary entry exploring the theme of cultural and language differences between two places (planets), in the context of his own experience.
           <br/>
           Write this diary entry, in about 120 words.
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
<p>
           A. A man is essentially a product of the circumstances and the environment that he lives in. Hail Singh was a boy of just fifteen but was an experienced thief who had a fairly successful hand in his profession. It was his circumstances that led him into such a profession that he retained even while he lived with Anil.
          </p>
<p>
           He went to live with Anil to rob him and was even successful in doing so. Howeve Anil was not a fool. He knew about Han’s act of theft but did not hand over Han to the police. It was his care, love and sympathy that affected Han so much that he could not run away after robbing And. Anil’s compassion and kind-heartedness brought about a change in Han. Further. Mil taught Hail how to read and write. The prospect of education created a deep impression on Han’s mind. He realised that with an education he would not only be able to earn money but will also become a respected man. Hence, it is true that education, love and sympathy can transform even a thief like Han Singh.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           B.

           Dear Diary.
           <br/>
           Today while going through old images, I came across one that Earthlings took when we became friends. It reminded us how our lack of understanding of the different cultures almost led us to a war. Once I was part of the probe that was sent to planef Earth. We faced many difficulties during that time as our team was not sufficiently intelligent or mature enough to understand Earth’s culture and language. Our head, Think Tank, himself was not aware of the Earth’s culture. Once he interpreted the nursery rhymes in the book Mother Goose’ and rhymes that the Earthlings were planning to invade Mars.
          </p>
<p>
           This led to the cancellation of our invasion of Earth. Phrases like ‘shell’, ‘silver’, ‘garden’ gave Think Tank a false idea that the Earthlings grew silver and cockle shells. This led him to think that the Earthlings were more advanced than Martians.
          </p>
<p>
           I hope all of us should be aware of other cultures and languages to avoid confusion and misunderstandings.
          </p>
<p>
           That’s all for tonight!
           <br/>
           Noodle
