<strong>
            Q6: Do you think the classification of economic activities into primary, tertiary, and secondary is useful? Explain how.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
            <br/>
</strong>
<strong>
            The classification of economic activities into primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors is helpful as mentioned below :
           </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
            It provides information on how and where the people of a country are employed. For example in India in 2000, the share of the primary sector in employment was about 60 percent e., more than other sectors.
           </li>
<li>
            It also helps in ascertaining as to which sector of economic activity contributes more or less to the country’s GDP and per capita income.
           </li>
<li>
            If the tertiary sector is developing much faster than the primary sector, then it implies that agriculture is depleting and the government must take measures to rectify this.
           </li>
<li>
            The knowledge that the agricultural profession is becoming unpopular or regressive can only come if we know which sector it belongs to.
           </li>
<li>
            It provides us information about employment conditions in different sectors. For example in India, the primary sector faces the problem of disguised unemployment. In this sector, more people are employed and even if some are removed, production will not be affected.

            It provides us the information about progress in different sectors. For example, the importance of the tertiary sector has increased due to various factors need for basic services and the coming of IT services.
            <br/>
            In view of the above factors, it is necessary to classify economic activities into three sectors for smooth economic administration and development.

<strong>
            Q7: For each of the following sectors that we came across in this chapter why should one focus on employment and GDP? Could there be other issues which should be examined? Discuss.

<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
            <br/>
</strong>
           (1) For each of the sectors we focus on employment and GDP due to the reasons mentioned below :
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            To know the number of people employed in that sector. For example in 2000, the share of the primary sector in employment was more than secondary and tertiary sectors.
           </li>
<li>
            To know the share of each sector in the GDP. For example in 2000, the share of the tertiary sector was more than that of the agriculture sector and secondary sector in the GDP.
           </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
            By focusing on GDP and employment we can draw conclusions regarding the generation of new employment opportunities in various sectors and take necessary steps accordingly.
           </li>
<li>
            We come to know employment conditions for workers such as in the unorganized sector and take necessary steps to improve their condition. So that the workers are not exploited.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           (2) Focus should be laid on other issues such as conditions of work, profit motive, efficiency, public welfare, environmentally friendly.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<ul>
<li>
            Conditions of work should be in the favour of workers.
           </li>
<li>
            The employment should be regular and the employer should follow various laws such as Factories Act, Minimum Wages Act etc.
           </li>
<li>
            The production must be for the welfare of the people who should not be exploited by raising prices or creating a scarcity of goods in the market. Thus, such issues must be examined while discussing the role of different sectors in the economy of the country.

            Q9: How is the tertiary sector different from other sectors? Illustrate with few examples.

<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
            <br/>
</strong>
<strong>
            The tertiary sector is different from other sectors as mentioned below :
           </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
            The activities of the tertiary sector help in the development of primary and secondary sectors.
           </li>
<li>
            These activities, by themselves, do not produce a good, but they are an aid or support for the production process. For example, the transport system helps in taking goods from the factory to markets for the purpose of selling or storing in godowns.
           </li>
<li>
            It provides telephones and other products for communication to the traders. Banks provide money to help production and trade.
           </li>
<li>
            Thus transport, storage, communication etc. are not tertiary activities. On the other hand, primary sector forms the base for all products that we subsequently make. Minerals and ores are natural products which are converted into other forms by manufacturing. Sugar is made from sugarcane.
           </li>
</ol>

            Q10: What do you understand by disguised unemployment? Explain with an example each from the urban and rural areas.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Disguised Unemployment is a kind of unemployment in which there are people who are visibly employed but are actually unemployed. This situation is also known as Hidden Unemployment. In such a situation more people are engaged in a work than required.
          </p>
<p>
           For example in rural areas, this type of unemployment is generally found in the agricultural sector like – in a family of 9 people all are engaged in the same agricultural plot. But if 4 people are withdrawn from it there will be no reduction in output. So, these 4 people are actually disguisedly employed.
          </p>
<p>
           In urban areas, this type of unemployment can be seen mostly in service sectors such as in a family all members are engaged in one petty shop or a small business which can be managed by less number of persons.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            Q11: Distinguish between open unemployment and disguised unemployment.
           </strong>
<br/>
           Open Unemployment – When a country’s labour force do not get opportunities fro adequate employment, this situation is called open unemployment. This type of unemployment is generally found in the industrial sector of our country. This is also found among the landless agricultural labourers in rural areas.
           <br/>
           Disguised Unemployment – This is a kind of unemployment in which there are people who are visibly employed but actually they don’t have full employment. In such a situation more people are engaged in a work than required. This type of unemployment is generally found in unorganized sector where either work is not constantly available or too many people are employed for the same work that does not require so many hands.

<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
            <br/>
</strong>
<strong>
            “The tertiary sector is not playing any significant role in the development of Indian economy” is partially correct due to reasons as mentioned below :
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           The share of tertiary sector in employment has not increased in proportion to its increase in production. In 2000, the production in service sector rose by 11 times, whereas employment has risen less than three times. Therefore, still more than half of the workers in the country are working in the primary sector.
          </p>
<p>
           New services such as based on information technology have become important, but not all the services of the service sector are growing well. At one end are highly skilled and educated workers but on the other end, there are a very large number of workers engaged in services such as small shopkeepers, repair Arsons, transport persons. These persons barely manage to earn a living and yet they perform these services because no alternative opportunities for work are available to them. Such persons can not play any important role in the development of the Indian economy. It is this part of service sector that is not growing in importance.

            Answer:
            <br/>
</strong>
           The service sector in India employs the following two different kinds of people. They are:
           <br/>
           (a) The people involved in the services that may directly help in the production of goods. For example, people involved in the transportation, storage, communication, finance etc.
           <br/>
           (b) The people involved in such services that may not directly help in the production of goods e.g. teachers, doctors, barbers, cobblers lawyers etc. They may be termed as ancillary workers means those who give services to the primary service providers.

            Answer:
            <br/>
</strong>
           Yes, workers are exploited in the unorganized sector. This would be clear from the following points:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            There is no fixed number of working hours. The workers normally work 10 – 12 hours without paid overtime.
           </li>
<li>
            They do not get other allowances apart fro the daily wages.
           </li>
<li>
            Government rules and regulations to protect the labourers are not followed there.
           </li>
<li>
            There is no job security.
           </li>
<li>
            Jobs are low paid the workers in this sector are generally illiterate, ignorant and unorganized. So they are not in a position to bargain or secure good wages.
           </li>
<li>
            Being very poor they are always heavily in debt. So, they can be easily made to accept lower wages.
           </li>

<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
            <br/>
</strong>
           On the basis of employment conditions, the activities in the economy are classified into organized and unorganized sectors.
          </p>
<p>
           Organized Sector This sector covers those enterprises which are registered by the government and have to follow its rules and regulations. For example, Reliance Industries Ltd., GAIL etc.
          </p>
<p>
           Unorganized Sector It includes those small and scattered units which are largely outside the control of the government. Though there are rules and regulations but these are never followed here. For example, casual workers in construction, shops etc. In this sector there is no job security and the conditions of employment are also very tough.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            Q16: Compare the employment conditions prevailing in the organised and unorganised sectors.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
            <br/>
</strong>
           The employment conditions prevailing in the organised and unorganised sectors are vastly different. The organised sector has companies registered with the government and hence, it offers job security, paid holidays, pensions, health and other benefits, fixed working hours and extra pay for overtime work. On the other hand, the unorganised sector is a host of opposites. There is no job security, no paid holidays or pensions on retirement, no benefits of provident fund or health insurance, unfixed working hours and no guarantee of safe work environment.

<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
            <br/>
</strong>
           The workers in the unorganised sector need protection on the following issues: wages, safety and health. In the construction sector, labourers are employed on a daily basis. Hence, they have no job security. Here, wages too differ from time to time. Consequently, the government has set up a minimum wages act to protect such workers from economic exploitation.
          </p>
<p>
           The same problem exists for miners working in private mining companies. Their safety is secondary to the company’s profits, and as a result, many miners suffer grievous injuries (and many a times, even die) due to inadequate safety gear and norms. Governments of most nations have now laid down strict rules for private enterprises to ensure workers’ safety.
          </p>
<p>
           Most companies in the unorganised sector do not provide health insurance to their employees. Some of these might be involved in dangerous factory production that may harm a worker’s health in the long term. These workers need to be protected against the tyranny of the employer, and it is here that the government steps in.

            Answer:
            <br/>
</strong>
           Ways to generate more employment in the city of Ahmedabad have to be provided by the government, especially in the unorganised sector. As the table shows, the organised sector’s earnings are much higher than that of the unorganised sector even though the latter employs almost 80% of the city workers. More companies need to be brought under the roof of the organised sector so that workers from the unorganised sector are attracted to jobs there, with higher and more secure wages. For this, the government must provide loans and aid to companies transferring from unorganised to organised sectors.
