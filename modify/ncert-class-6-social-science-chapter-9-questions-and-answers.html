</p>
<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Why is the family unit important?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The family unit is important as it plays a crucial role in the development of individuals and the well-being of society as a whole. Here are some reasons why families are important:
           <br/>
           (a)Nurturing and Emotional Support.
           <br/>
           (b)Socialization and Values
           <br/>
           (c)Identity and Self-esteem
           <br/>
           (d)Practical Support
           <br/>
           (e)Community Building
           <br/>
           (j) Resilience
          </p>
<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           What is a community and what is its role?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A community is a group of people living in a specific area and sharing common characteristics or interests. It can be defined by geography (a village, town, city, or neighbourhood), by social ties (religious groups, sports teams, online communities), or by shared experiences (people who have gone through a similar life event).

</div>
<p>
           Here are some key roles that communities play:
           <br/>
           (a)Shared. Resources and Services: Communities often have shared resources and services, such as schools, hospitals, parks, libraries, and transportation systems. These resources contribute to the well-being and quality of life for community members.
          </p>
<p>
           (b)Problem-Solving and Collaboration: Communities can work together to address common challenges and improve their living conditions. This can involve issues like environmental protection, crime prevention, development and cleanliness drive.
          </p>
<p>
           (c)Preserving Culture and Traditions: Communities can play a role in preserving cultural traditions and practices. They can provide a space for people to celebrate their heritage, and pass down traditions to future generations.
           <br/>
           Overall, communities play a vital role in fostering social connections, providing support, and promoting well-being for their members. They contribute to a sense of belonging, shared purpose, and collective action.

           (b) Joint Family: Multiple generations living together, including parents, children, grandparents. There are around 10-15 such families in our apartment society.
           <br/>
           (c) Single-parent Family: A household with one parent and their children. This can be due to divorce, or separation. There are around 4-5 such families in our apartment society.

           <br/>
           A. Nuclear Family: This remains a common family structure in many societies specially in cities. India is witnessing a surge in the number of nuclear family. Nuclear family is a growing trend modern times.

           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Why. do you think Shaliniâ€™s parents bought clothes for everyone? (Page 141)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Family relations are based on love, care, and affection. Each member of the family has a role and responsibility towards other members. Shaliniâ€™s parents bought clothes for everyone to show their love and support for her uncle and aunt.
          </p>

           Question 4.
           <br/>
           What would you have done if you were in Shaliniâ€™s place?(Page 141)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           If I was in Shaliniâ€™s place, I would be happy that everyone in my family could get some new clothes for the festival of Onam. Even if I had to settle for a cotton cloth, instead of a silk cloth, I would have been happy as family members supports each other.

           Why does Tenzingâ€™s father consult his wife for special expenses? (Page 142)
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Shared Decision-Making: In some cultures, financial decisions, even for special expenses, are made jointly by spouses.
           </li>
<li>
            Respect and Partnership: Consulting his wife could be a sign of respect for her opinion and a way to involve her in financial decisions impacting the entire family.
           </li>
<li>
            Budgeting and Planning: Perhaps Tenzingâ€™s father values his wifeâ€™s input in planning and budgeting for the household.

            Questions, Activities And Projects (Page 148)
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           What are some of the rules you follow in your family and neighbourhood? Why are they important?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Some general rules in my family and neighbourhood are as follows:
           <br/>
           I. In the Family:
           <br/>
           (a) Respectful Communication: This might involve using kind words, listening attentively, and resolving conflicts peacefully.
           <br/>
           (b) Chores and Responsibilities: Contributing to household tasks teaches responsibility, time man-agement, and life skills.
           <br/>
           (c) Curfews and Screen Time Limits: These rules promote healthy sleep habits, a balance between screen time and other activities, and personal safety (especially for nighttime curfews).
           <br/>
           (d) Honesty and Truthfulness: Building trust is essential within a family. Honesty allows parents to provide guidance and support when needed.
          </p>
<p>
           II. In the Neighbourhood
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Property Respect: This involves not damaging other peopleâ€™s property, being mindful of noise levels, and keeping the Neighbourhood clean.
           </li>
<li>
            By following these rules, I have learnt valuable life skills and have become a responsible member of my family and neighbourhood.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Do you think some rules are unfair to a few people in the family or community? Why?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Some rules are unfair for a few reasons:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Unequal Application: Sometimes, children might feel like the rules are enforced inconsistently. For example, a younger sibling might get away with something an older sibling gets in trouble for. This can lead to feelings of resentment and a belief that the rules are unfair.
           </li>
<li>
            Lack of Understanding: If the reasons behind a rule arenâ€™t explained clearly, people might not understand the purpose. This can make them feel like the rule is arbitrary and unfair. For instance, a teen might not understand why they have a curfew if their parents havenâ€™t explained the importance of sleep or safety concerns.
           </li>
<li>
            Favoritism: If students perceive that certain family members or neighbours are favored and get away with breaking rules, it can feel unfair. This can be especially damaging if the student feels they are being held to a higher standard.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Hereâ€™s how parents and communities can address these issues:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Open Communication: Explain the reasons behind the rules and have open conversations about expectations.
           </li>
<li>
            Fair and Consistent Enforcement: Apply the rules fairly to everyone, regardless of age or relationship.
           </li>
<li>
            Consider Age and Maturity: Adjust rules as students grow and demonstrate responsibility.
            <br/>
            By working together, parents, students, and communities can create a set of rules that are fair, understandable, and beneficial for everyone.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
