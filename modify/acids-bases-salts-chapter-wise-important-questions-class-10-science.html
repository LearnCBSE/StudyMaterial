           Important Questions of Acids Bases and Salts Class 10 Science Chapter 2
          </h2>
<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           With the help of an example explain what happens when a base reacts with a non- metallic oxide. What do you infer about the nature of non-metal oxide? (Board Term I, 2017)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Oxides of non-metals react with bases to form salt and water. For example, the reaction between carbon dioxide and calcium hydroxide. Calcium hydroxide, which is a base, reacts with carbon dioxide to produce salt and water.
           <br/>
<img alt="Acids Bases and Salts Class 10 Important Questions with Answers Science Chapter 2 Img 1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-145735" height="57" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Acids-Bases-and-Salts-Class-10-Important-Questions-with-Answers-Science-Chapter-2-Img-1.png" width="270"/>
<br/>
           Hence, oxides of non-metals are acidic in nature.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           What is observed when carbon dioxide gas is passed through lime water
           <br/>
           (i) for a short duration?
           <br/>
           (ii) for a long duration? Also write the chemical equations for the reactions involved. (Board Term I, 2016)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) When CO
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           is passed through lime water for short interval of time, it turns milky due to the formation of insoluble calcium carbonate.
           <br/>

</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           (ii) If CO
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           is passed for long duration through lime water, the white precipitate formed dissolves due to the formation of soluble calcium hydrogen carbonate and the solution becomes clear.
           <br/>

<p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           2 mL of sodium hydroxide solution is added to a few pieces of granulated zinc metal taken in a test tube. When the content are warmed, a gas evolves which is bubbled through a soap solution before testing. Write the equation of the chemical reaction involved and the test to detect the gas. Name the gas which will be evolved when the same metal reacts with dilute solution of a strong acid.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           It is observed that active metals like zinc react with strong bases like NaOH, KOH etc. to liberate hydrogen gas and corresponding salt.
           <br/>
<img alt="Acids Bases and Salts Class 10 Important Questions with Answers Science Chapter 2 Img 4" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-145738" height="58" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 327px) 100vw, 327px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Acids-Bases-and-Salts-Class-10-Important-Questions-with-Answers-Science-Chapter-2-Img-4.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Acids-Bases-and-Salts-Class-10-Important-Questions-with-Answers-Science-Chapter-2-Img-4.png 327w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Acids-Bases-and-Salts-Class-10-Important-Questions-with-Answers-Science-Chapter-2-Img-4-300x53.png 300w" width="327"/>
</p>
<p>
           The evolution of gas is confirmed by the bubble formation in soap solution.
           <br/>
           Test to detect H
           <sub>
            2

<p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Write the names of the product formed when zinc reacts with NaOH. Also write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction involved. Write a test to confirm the presence of the gas evolved during this reaction. (Board Term I, 2015)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Refer to answer 3.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           To. a solution of sodium hydroxide in a test tube, two drops of phenolphthalein are added.
           <br/>
           (i) State the colour change observed.
           <br/>
           (ii) If dil HCl is added dropwise to the solution, what will be the colour change?
           <br/>
           (iii) On adding few drops of NaOH solution to the above mixture the colour of the solution reappears. Why? (Board Term I, 2013)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) On adding phenolphthalein to NaOH solution, the colour becomes pink.
           <br/>
           (ii) On adding dilute HCl solution dropwise to the same test tube, the pink colour disappears and the solution again becomes colourless.
           <br/>
           (iii) On again adding NaOH to the above mixture, pink colour reappears because the medium becomes basic again.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 6.
           <br/>
           A cloth’strip dipped in onion juice is used for testing a liquid ‘X. The liquid ‘X changes its
           <br/>
           odour. Which type of an indicator is onion juice? The liquid ‘X turns blue litmus red. List the observations the liquid ‘X will show on reacting with the following :
           <br/>
           (a) Zinc granules
           <br/>
           (b) Solid sodium carbonate
           <br/>
           Write the chemical equations for the reactions involved.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Onion juice is an olfactory indicator. Olfactory indicators give one type of odour in acidic medium and a different odour in basic medium. As the liquid ‘X’ turns blue litmus red, hence it is an acidic solution.
           <br/>
           (a) Acids react with active metals such as zinc, magnesium etc. and evolve hydrogen gas, for example,
           <br/>

           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The chemical formula of marble (lime stone) is CaCO

           Question 8.
           <br/>
           On diluting an acid, it is advised to add acid to water and not water to acid. Explain why it is so advised? (Board Term I, 2014)
           <br/>
           Draw a labelled diagram to show the preparation of hydrogen chloride gas in laboratory.
           <br/>
           (ii) Test the gas evolved first with dry and then with wet litmus paper. In which of the two cases, does the litmus paper show change in colour?
           <br/>
           (iii) State the reason of exhibiting acidic character by dry HCl gas/HCl solution.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Diluting a concentrated acid with water is a highly exothermic process. So, when water is added to concentrated acid, large amounts of heat is liberated which changes some water to steam explosively which can splash the acid and even the glass apparatus may break due to excessive heating.

           (i) Draw a labelled diagram to show the preparation of hydrogen chloride gas in laboratory.
           <br/>
           (ii) Test the gas evolved first with dry and then with wet litmus paper. In which of the two cases, does the litmus paper show change in colour?
           <br/>
           (iii) State the reason of exhibiting acidic character by dry HCl gas/HCl solution. (2020)

           (ii) There is no change in the colour of ‘dry’ blue litmus paper but ‘moist’ blue litmus paper turns red if brought near the mouth of the test tube.
           <br/>
           This shows that HCl gas does not show acidic behaviour in absence of water but it shows acidic behaviour in presence of water.

           <br/>
           (a) Take two beakers, one containing HCl acid and other containing alcohol which is not an acid but contains hydrogen. Now, fix two iron nails on a rubber cork and insert in a beaker and connect the nail to the two terminal of 6V battery through a switch and a bulb. Pour some dilute HCl solution in beaker and switch on the current. The bulb starts glowing. This shows that acids get dissociated as H

            +
           </sup>
           and Cl
           <sup>
            –
           </sup>
           ions and these ions are responsible for conducting electricity.

<br/>
           Let us now take alcohol solution in the beaker and switch on the current. The bulb does not glow in this case. This shows that alcohol does not conduct electricity.

<br/>
           So, all acids have hydrogen but all hydrogen containing compounds are not acid.

           Question 14.
           <br/>
           An aqueous solution ‘A’ turns phenolphthalein solution pink. On addition of an aqueous solution ‘B’ to ‘A’ the pink colour disappears. The following statement is true for solution ‘A’ and ‘B’:
           <br/>
           (a) A is strongly basic and B is a weak base.
           <br/>
           (b) A is strongly acidic and B is a weak acid.
           <br/>
           (c) A has pH greater than 7 and B has pH less than 7.
           <br/>
           (d) A has pH less than 7 and B has pH greater than 7. (2020)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (c) As the aqueous solution of A turns phenolphthalein solution pink, hence A is basic in nature. On adding an acidic solution, the pink colour will disappear. Hence, B is an acid.

           <sub>
            3
           </sub>
           COOH is a weak acid because it dissociates partially in the solution. This can be proved with the help of following example.
          </p>
<p>
           If 1 M HCl and 1 M CH

           Question 16.
           <br/>
           Explain how an antacid works. (Board Term I, 2017)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The acidity produced due to excess hydrochloric acid in the stomach which cause indigestion, produce pain and irritation. Milk of magnesia (chemically magnesium hydroxide) is used as an antacid. Since, it is basic in nature, reacts with the excess hydrochloric acid present in the stomach and neutralises it.

           Question 17.
           <br/>
           (a) Three acidic solutions A, B and C have pH = 0, 3 and 5 respectively.
           <br/>
           (i) Which solution has highest concentration of H
           <sup>
            +
           </sup>
           ions?
           <br/>
           (ii) Which solution has the lowest concentration of H
           <sup>
            +
           </sup>
           ions?
           <br/>
           (b) How concentrated sulphuric acid can be diluted? Describe the process. (Board Term I, 2014)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) (i) The solution having lower pH will have more hydrogen ion concentration. Hence, solution ‘A’ will have highest H
           <sup>
            +
           </sup>
           ion concentration.
           <br/>
           (ii) Solution CC’ i.e., pH = 5 has the lowest concentration of H
           <sup>
            +
           </sup>
           ions.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) Mixing of an acid with water is called dilution. This process is highly exothermic and therefore, acid is always added to the water not water to acid. The process for diluting concentrated sulphuric acid is :
           <br/>
           (i) Take about 10 mL of water in a beaker.
           <br/>
           (ii) Add concentrated sulphuric acid dropwise to water and swirl the beaker slowly.

           Question 18.
           <br/>
           A compound P forms the enamel of teeth. It is the hardest substance of the body. It doesn’t dissolve in water but gets corroded when the pH is lowered below 5.5.
           <br/>
           (a) Identify the compound P.
           <br/>
           (b) How does it undergo damage due to eating chocolate and sweets? What should we do to prevent tooth decay? (Board Term I, 2014, 2013)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The compound P is calcium phosphate, (b) Eating chocolates and sweets produce large amount of acid in the mouth which is not completely neutralised by the saliva produced in the mouth. Excess acid attacks the enamel and tooth decay starts as pH of the mouth falls below 5.5. The best way to prevent tooth decay is to clean the teeth by using toothpastes after eating food. Toothpastes which are generally basic neutralise the excess acid in the mouth.

<br/>
           It is used to remove the permanent hardness of water. Hard water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda when chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium present in hard water get precipitated as insoluble calcium and magnesium carbonates which can be easily filtered off. The water thus becomes soft.

           Question 26.
           <br/>
           Give reasons for the following:
           <br/>
           (i) Only one half of water molecule is shown in the formula of plaster of Paris.
           <br/>
           (ii) Sodium hydrogen carbonate is used as an antacid.
           <br/>
           (iii) On strong heating, blue coloured copper sulphate crystals turn white. (2020)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Only one half of water molecule is shown in the formula of plaster of Paris (CaSO
           <sub>
            4
           </sub>
           . \(\frac { 1 }{ 2 }\) H
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           O) as one molecule of water is being shared by two molecules of calcium sulphate (CaSO
           <sub>
            4
           </sub>
           ). So the effective water of crystallisation for one CaSO
           <sub>
            4
           </sub>
           unit comes to half molecule of water.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Acidity can be neutralised by a base. Sodium hydrogen carbonate can be used as an antacid solution because it is a weak base and will react
           <br/>
           with excess acid produced in the stomach due to hyperacidity and will neutralise it.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Blue coloured copper sulphate crystals are hydrated copper sulphate, CuSO
           <sub>

           Question 28.
           <br/>
           Identify the acid and the base from which sodium chloride is obtained. Which type of salt is it? When is it called rock salt? How is rock salt formed? (Delhi 2019)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Sodium chloride is obtained by the neutralisation of sodium hydroxide (base) with hydrochloric acid (acid). It is a neutral salt. Common salt found in the form of solid deposits is often brown in colour due to presence of impurities which is called rock salt. Rock salt is formed by evaporation of salty water of inland lakes.

           Question 29.
           <br/>
           A white powder is added while baking cakes to make it soft and spongy. Name its main ingredients. Explain the function of each ingredient. Write the chemical reaction taking place when the powder is heated during baking. (AI2019)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The white powder added while baking cakes to make it soft and spongy is baking powder. Its main ingredients are sodium hydrogen carbonate and a mild edible acid like tartaric acid or citric acid. NaHCO
           <sub>

            2
           </sub>
           which causes the cake to rise and makes it soft and spongy. The function of tartaric acid or citric acid is to neutralise sodium carbonate formed during heating which can otherwise make the cake bitter. Reaction taking place when the powder is heated:

           Question 34.
           <br/>
           (a) Define an acid-base indicator. Mention one synthetic acid-base indicator.
           <br/>
           (b) If someone in the family is suffering from a problem of acidity after overeating, which of the following substances would you suggest as a remedy?
           <br/>
           Lemon juice, vinegar or baking soda solution. Mention the property on the basis of which you will choose the remedy. (Board Term I, 2014)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Acid – base indicators : The indicators which show different colours in acidic and basic medium are called acid-base indicators. Phenolphthalein is a synthetic indicator.
           <br/>
           (b) Acidity can be neutralised by a base. Hence, we should choose baking soda solution because it is a weak base and will react with excess acid produced in the stomach due to hyperacidity and will neutralise it.
          </p>
