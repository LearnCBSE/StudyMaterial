<p>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:

<br/>
           The UGC pays the amount of the scholarship directly through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT). They transfer the amount into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. Thus, it is necessary for the applicants to have their own bank account at any Indian bank when they are applying for scholarships or fellowships.

<p>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
<br/>
           The renewal of the scholarship demands the student to submit a yearly progress report to their respective bank’s branch duly signed by the HoD and Registrar of the University of Principal of the College or Head of the Institution. If the student fails to maintain satisfactory progress during his/her study, the scholarship may get canceled.
