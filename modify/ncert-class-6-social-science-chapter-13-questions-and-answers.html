            The Big Questions (Page 183)
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           What are the different types of activities that people engage in?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           There areitwo types of activities that people are engaged in. These are:
           <br/>
           Economic Activities:
           <br/>
           Economic activity is an activity that involves money or is performed in exchange for money.
           <br/>
           For Examples: Pilot, Teacher, Actor, Journalist and Fashion Designer.
          </p>
<p>
           Non-Economic Activities:
           <br/>
           An activity that is done out of feeling of gratitude, love and care without any involvement of money is called a Non-economic activity.
           <br/>
           For Examples: Cooking food, serving at temple or Gurudwara, doing voluntary services of taking care of the elderly in old age homes, etc.

<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           What is their contribution to our everyday lives?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Economic activities enable people to earn their livelihood by producing goods and services which are needed in an economy. Farmers by cultivating grains satisfy food requirements whereas a police officer by enfocing laws protects lives and property.
           <br/>
           Non-Economic activities are essential in our everyday lives. They foster love, care, gratitude, respect and patriotism amongst the citizens in the country.

           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           When Kabir’s grandfather voluntarily teaches the neighbourhood kids for free, is that an economic actimty or a non-economic activity? How is it different from your teachers teaching you at school? Discuss with your classmates. (Page 187)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When Kabir’s grandfather voluntarily teaches the neighborhood kids for free, it’s a non-economic activity as this activity does not involve money. Grandfather wishes to contribute to the community by teaching kids in his free time. He is not earning income from this activity.
           <br/>
           When a teacher teaches us at school, she is paid a salary for the service rendered by her. Thus, teaching at school involves an exchange of service for money. Therefore it is an economic activity.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           What are some non-economic actimties that are important to you and your family? Why are they valuable? (Page 187)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Many non-economic activities are important in a family. Some of these are parents cooking nutritious meals at home, washing clothes, and maintaining hygiene at home by keeping it clean. Most importantly looking after the physiological and psychological needs of the young and the old in the family.
           <br/>
           These activities are very valuable to the family as well as the society. These activities contribute to personal well-being, social cohesion, cultural development, and overall quality of life.

           Question 5.
           <br/>
           We celebrate many festivals in India. During these festivals, people gather to organise all the various activities. They decorate the place together and share the food that they cook. Are these non-economic activities? Why do you think they still hold value? (Page 193)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Celebrating festivals is a noneconomic activity as it is not done with the motive to earn money. Sharing food, decorating places, and organizing various activities during festivals foster the feeling of oneness, unity, love, respect, and care among people living in a country.
