           What was Jumman’s verdict as head Panch? How did Algu take it? (14, 15)
           <br/>
<strong>
            Ans:
           </strong>
           Jumman’s verdict was that Sahu had to pay the price of bullock to Algu. Because when Sahu purchased the bullock from Algu it was hale and hearty. This was a genuine decision. Algu took it happily and said it was a victory of the panchayat.

<strong>
            1. How did Algu and Jumman treat each other?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans:
           </strong>
           Algu and Jumman were fast friends. But they became enemies when Algu decided the case in favour of the old aunt. Jumman also got a chance to take revenge. But as head Panch he also acted as fair and just. They became friends again.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            2. How did Jumman treat his old aunt?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans:
           </strong>
           Jumman got his aunt’s property transferred in his name. He promised to support her. But soon they were tired of her. His wife insulted their aunt when she gave her little food.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            3. How did the old aunt get justice?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans:
           </strong>
           The old aunt presented her case before the village panchayat. She had faith in the honesty of Algu. So she named Algu the head Panch. Algu ignored his friendship with Jumman for the sake of truth and justice.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            4. What were the common characteristics between Algu and Jumman?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans:
           </strong>
           Algu and Jumman belonged to two different faiths. Yet both valued their friendship equally. Both had a clean conscience. Neither allowed his personal feelings to affect their love for truth and justice.
          </p>

<strong>
            5.What decisions were given by Algu and Jumman as head Panch?

<strong>
             II.LONG ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS
            </strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
            1. Why did Jumman Shaikh and Algu Chowdhry, the two good friends, become sworn enemies?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans:
           </strong>
           Jumman and Algu were fast friends. They trusted each other blindly. But an incident broke them apart. Jumman had got the property of his old aunt. But after some duration he began to ignore and ill treat her. She demanded a monthly allowance or the return of her land. The panchayat was called to hear the case. Algu as the head Panch decided the case in favour of the old aunt. The two friends became sworn enemies.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            2. How did Jumman and Algu get over their bitterness and become friends again?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans:
           </strong>
           Jumman Shaikh and Algu Chowdhry broke up when Algu gave his verdict in favour of Jumman’s aunt. Algu heard the voice of his conscience and did justice. But Jumman waited for his turn to take revenge. He got that chance soon. Algu was being cheated by Sahu. Hence, a panchayat was held. Sahu named Jumman as head Panch. But as soon as Jumman occupied that seat of responsibility, he too decided the case on facts and merit. His verdict in favour of Algu brought them closer once again.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            3.Which is more desirable-friendship or enmity? When does a person hear strongly the voice of his conscience?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans:
           </strong>
           It goes without saying that friendship is based on goodwill and respect for one another. Enmity is created by hatred and ill-will. Friendship is definitely far better than enmity. Every person has a weakness for friends. But the moment he occupies the seat of judgement, he hears the voice of his conscience and gives a fair verdict.
