<h2>
           CBSE Class 7 English Letter Writing
          </h2>
<p>
           Letter writing is one of the very effective modes of communication. Letters can
           <br/>
           be :
           <br/>
           1. Personal — to friends or relatives.
           <br/>
           2. Business — placing and receiving orders, complaints etc.
           <br/>
           3. Official — to different government or public offices.
           <br/>
           4. Invitations — formal and informal.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            The form or Structure
           </strong>
<br/>
           Each type of letter has its own particular form, but there are certain features common to all types. These are :
           <br/>
<strong>
            1. The Heading
           </strong>
<br/>
           This consists of the writer’s address and the date which should be written at the top left-hand comer of the letter. For example :
           <br/>
           58, Roypeta
           <br/>
           Chennai
           <br/>
           28 March, 2016
           <br/>
           Notes : The heading may not be written in formal invitation.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
<strong>
            2. The Date
           </strong>
<br/>
           Always write the date below the sender’s address. The students can choose any of the following ways of writing the date.
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            10 March 2016
           </li>
<li>
            10 March, 2016
           </li>
<li>
            10th March, 2016
           </li>
<li>
            March 10, 2016
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Unless mentioned in the question, students should write the same date on which they are taking the examination.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            3. Greeting or Salutation
           </strong>
<br/>
           The salutation should be written below the address and date after leaving the space of a line or so. The form of salutation will vary according to the type of letter you write.
           <br/>
<strong>
            A. Personal Letter
           </strong>
<br/>
           (a) To members of the family, the salutation will be :
           <br/>
           My dear Father, My dear Mother, My dear Sister, My dear Brother, etc.
           <br/>
           To uncles, aunts, cousins, etc, you may use either ‘My dear’ or ‘Dear’ depending upon your intimacy with them.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           (b) To friends, the salutation will be :
           <br/>
           Dear Mr. Sharma (not very intimate)
           <br/>
           Dear Mohan (intimate)
           <br/>
           My dear Mohani (very intimate and affectionate)
          </p>
<p>
           (c) To strangers the salutation will be just formal. If they are men, it will be ‘Dear Sir’, if women, it will be
           <br/>
           ‘Dear Madam’.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            4. The Address on the Envelope or Superscription
           </strong>
<br/>
           The address should be written very clearly in this manner :
           <br/>
           Mrs Anamika Raj
           <br/>
           58, Mount Road
           <br/>
           Chennai
           <br/>
<strong>
            Notes :
           </strong>
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<ol>
<li>
            When you write a letter in an examination paper, don’t write your real name or address. You may use a fictitious name.
           </li>
<li>
            Remember that the style of a personal letter is quite different from business, official or any other type of letters. These are intimate and long whereas the others are brief and to the point.
           </li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: center;">

            Business Letters
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           1. Business letters should be short and to the point. Businessmen are always busy. They have no time to read long and confusing letters.
           <br/>
           2. The style is always very formal. Certain terms of polite expressions are used, such as—
           <br/>
           “I shall be much obliged if you send me,”
           <br/>
           “Please despatch at your earliest convenience,” etc.
           <br/>
           3. Business jargon should be avoided.
           <br/>
           4. Avoid abbreviations as far as possible.
           <br/>
           5. While ordering goods, care should be taken to give clear and exact descriptions of the articles wanted. If you are making a complaint, it should also be very clear though polite.
          </p>

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           To Police Commissioner complaining against crime
           <br/>
           You are Amit/Anu Pillai of C-43, Maya Enclave, Bengaluru. Everyday you read newspaper reports about a number of crimes and murders. Write a letter to the Commissioner of Police, Bengaluru, complaining about the rising rate of crime in the city.

           <br/>
           The Commissioner of Police Bengaluru
           <br/>
           Sir
           <br/>
           I want to invite your kind attention towards the rising rate of crime in the city. Everyday we read in the newspapers about crimes and murders here and there. The old men and women are murdered. Their valuables are stolen. Crime graph against women is rising high. Women and young girls fear to go out alone during evenings. Rapes, chain snatchings etc, occur daily. Anti-social elements move freely without any fear. They strike when they see a lonely woman or a girl. Life has become very fearful due to the high rate of crime.
          </p>
<p>
           Under the circumstances, I request you to look into the matter without delay. Please take a strict action against the criminals. The policemen not discharging their duties should also be punished. I hope these steps shall help in bringing down the crime.
           <br/>
           Thanking you
           <br/>

           <br/>
           Sir
           <br/>
           Kindly allow me to draw your attention to the nuisance of air pollution. I would Request you to take proper action against it.
           <br/>
           A few years back, Pantnagar was a very quiet town. People in it felt proud of its clean surroundings. But of late the people seem to have forgotten the value of peace. All through the day, loudspeakers play at high pitch. When there is a marriage or jagran, one can’t sleep even during the night.
           <br/>
           These are the examination days. The students can’t study due to this noise. I, therefore, request you to kindly look into the matter personally and give us some relief.
           <br/>
           With thanks

           <br/>
           Dear Sir
           <br/>
           You will agree that our locality is, perhaps, the dirtiest in the district. The reason is simple. It is the locality which has kaccha roads. These roads become muddy when a little rain falls. The water stays on the roads almost all through the year. There is no drainage. The stagnant water creates pits and pools. There occur many fatal accidents due to these potholes.
          </p>
<p>
           There is a small dispensary in the locality. It is too small to do anything worthwhile for the people. Here too the doctor is generally absent.
          </p>
<p>
           While the streets are full of water, the water-taps are generally dry. The electricity plays hide and seek all the time. The conditions are so bad that many people have already left this locality.
           <br/>
           Please do something to solve these problems of this locality.
           <br/>
           Yours faithfully
           <br/>

           <br/>
           Dear Sir
           <br/>
           I want to draw your attention to the poor bus service to and from our locality.
           <br/>
           The buses do not seem to follow any time-table. They generally run late. Sometimes some buses pass much before time. Irregularity is the rule.
           <br/>
           The number of buses from our locality for major routes is also insufficient. The passengers have to wait for about 30 minutes if they miss a bus. Kindly increase the number of buses particularly in the morning and the evening. This will solve the problem of over-crowding too.
           <br/>
           One great trouble is the road-worthiness of these buses. I think that the buses are very old. They quite often stop mid-way adding to our woes.
           <br/>
           Kindly look into the matter personally and oblige.
           <br/>
           Yours

           Dear Sir
           <br/>
           Please permit me some space in your newspaper. I wish to draw the attention of the government towards the electricity supply in Lucknow.
           <br/>
           The lack of electricity supply is causing much trouble to this city. The supply we get is not only short but also highly irregular. We do not know about the hours of cut.
           <br/>
           It has also affected the supply of water. If there is no light in the morning, there is no water either. The local water board also depends on the supply of electricity. Streets are dark in the night. It causes accidents. The students cannot study well.
           <br/>
           I wish to make an urgent appeal to every person concerned to help.
           <br/>
           With thanks

           <br/>
           Through your newspaper, I wish to raise my voice against the misuse of public property. There is large scale encroachment on the pavements and public parks. The roads have shrunk because shopkeepers have occupied the pavements. Some daring shopkeepers have occupied the public parks also.
           <br/>
           I appeal to the authorities to use force against such people. If the roads become free from encroachment, there will be no traffic-jam.

           Dear Sir
           <br/>
           Sub : Reckless driving
           <br/>
           The accident reported in your newspaper dated April 9 is not an isolated incident. It is a regular feature of life in this town. On an average, two accidents happen in this city every month. The main reason is that the drivers ignore the prescribed speed-limit and drive vehicles at a very high speed even through the main streets.
          </p>
<p>
           These accidents cause panic among the people. Human life is precious. I request the local police to rise to the occasion and penalise the careless drivers who exceed the prescribed speed-limit. Law-breakers do not deserve any sympathy.
           <br/>
           I would suggest that the drivers who are caught twice within a year’s time should lose their driving licence.
           <br/>
