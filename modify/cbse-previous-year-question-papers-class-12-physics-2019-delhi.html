<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Draw the pattern of electric field lines, when a point charge – Q is kept near an uncharged conducting plate. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The positive charge will be induced on the uncharged conducting plate, kept near it. So, the lines of forces will start from metal plate and end -Q
           <br/>

<br/>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           How does the mobility of electrons in a conductor change, if the potential difference applied across the conductor is doubled, keeping the length and temperature of the conductor constant ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The mobility of electrons is given by the

           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Define the term “threshold frequency” in the context of photoelectric emission.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Define the term ‘Intensity’ in photon picture of electromagnetic radiation.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The minimum frequency of the radiation incident on a metal surface below which there is no photoelectric emission is called threshold frequency. It is a characteristic property of a photosensitive material.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           The amount of light energy or photon energy incident per meter square per second is called intensity of radiation. SI unit of intensity of radiation is W/Sr

           Question 5.
           <br/>
           In sky wave mode of propagation, why is the frequency range of transmitting signals restricted to less than 30 MHz ?
           <br/>
           OR

           Question 11.
           <br/>
           Why is wave theory of electromagnetic radiation not able to explain photo electric effect ? How does photon picture resolve this problem ? [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Wave theory cannot explain the following laws of photoelectric effect.
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            The instantaneous emission of photo electrons.
           </li>
<li>
            Existence of threshold frequency for metal surface.
           </li>
<li>
            K.E. of emitted electrons is independent of intensity of light and depends on frequency.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           The concept of photon explained that energy is not only emitted and absorbed in discrete energy quanta, but also it propagates through space in definite quanta with the speed of light. It can explain all the above photoelectric effect, which wave theory cannot explain.
          </p>

           Question 16.

           Define the term wave front. Using Huygens’s wave theory, verify the law of reflection. [3]
           <br/>

           <br/>
           Define the term, “refractive index” of a medium. Verify Snell’s law of refraction when a plane wave front is propagating from a denser to a rarer medium.
           <br/>
           Answer:

           A wave front is the continuous locus of vibrating particles which are in the same state of vibration or phase.

           Laws of Reflection from Huygens principle
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 Physics 2019 Delhi 124" height="222" loading="lazy" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48534288572_48d11db7e3_o.png" width="343"/>
<br/>
           Consider a plane wave front AB incident on a plane reflecting surface PQ, Let v be the velocity of the wave. At time t – 0 one end of the wave front just touches the reflecting surface at B. Draw normal NB to PQ. When the wave front strikes the reflecting surface, then due to the presence of it, it cannot advance further. When wave front strikes at B, secondary wavelets starts emitting from B. The secondary wavelets will travel a distance AD = vt during the time the other end A of the wave front AB reaches the surface PQ at Q. To find the reflected wave front, B as a center and AD as radius draw an arc, which represent the secondary wavelets originating from B. As the incident wave front AB advances, the secondary wavelets will touch CD simultaneously.
           <br/>
           According to Huygens’s principle CD represents the reflected wave front corresponding to incident wave front AB. BD is common triangles BAD and CBD and BC = AD = vt. Therefore, two triangles are congruent.
           <br/>
           So, ∠ABD = ∠CDB
           <br/>
           i. e., ∠i = ∠r
           <br/>
           Thus, angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. This is the second law of reflection. Also, the incident wave front AB, reflecting surface PQ and the reflected wave front CD are perpendicular to the plane of the paper. So, the incident ray, reflected ray and the normal at the point of incidence, all lie in same plane. This is first law of reflection.
           <br/>
           Thus, Huygens’s principle explains both the law of reflection.

           Write three points of differences between para, dia, and ferromagnetic materials, giving one example for each.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Gauss law for magnetism : If a closed surface is imagined in a magnetic field, the number of lines of force emerging from the surface must be equal to the number entering it. That is, the net magnetic flux out of any closed surface is zero.
           <br/>
           Gauss law signifies that magnetic mono poles does not exist.
           <br/>
           (b)
           <br/>
           1. In a bar magnet, each lines of force, starts from a north pole and reaches the south pole externally and then goes from south pole to a north pole internally. Thus, magnetic line of force forms a closed loop.
           <br/>
           2. No two lines of force will never intersect each other.
           <br/>
           3. In a uniform field, the lines are parallel and equidistant from each other.
           <br/>
           4. The lines of force are crowded near the poles.

<img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 Physics 2019 Delhi 139" height="199" loading="lazy" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48534419887_73bcfe1c76_o.png" width="342"/>
<br/>
           For full wave rectifier, we use two junction diodes as shown in figure.
           <br/>
           During first half cycle of input a.c. signal the terminal Si is positive relative to S and S
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           is negative, then diode Di is in forward biased and diode D
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           is reverse biased. Therefore, current flows in D
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           not in D
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           . In next half cycle, Si is negative and S
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           is positive relative to S. Then D
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           is in reverse biased and D
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           is in forward biased. Therefore, current flows in D
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           not in Di. Thus, for input a.c. signal the output current is a continuous series of unidirectional pulse.
           <br/>
           The input and output wave forms are shown in the figure.

           (b) Let the two charges of + q each placed at point A and B at a distance 2 m apart in air.
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 Physics 2019 Delhi 166" height="59" loading="lazy" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48534965292_dfc96a8644_o.png" width="359"/>

           Suppose, the third charge Q (unknown magnitude and charge) is placed at a point O, on the line joining the other two charges, such that OA= x and OB 2-x.
           <br/>
           For the system to be in equilibrium, net force on each 3 charges must be zero.
           <br/>
           If we assume that charge Q placed at O is positive, the force on it at O may be zero. But the force on charge q at point A or B will not be zero. It is because, the forces on a charge q due to the other two charges will act in same direction. If charge Q is negative, then the forces on q due to other two charges will act in opposite direction.
           <br/>
           Hence, Q will be negative in nature. For charge (-Q) to be in equilibrium Force on charge (-q) due to charge (+q) at point A should be equal and opposite to charge (+Q) at B
           <br/>

           Therefore, for the system to be in equilibrium a charge – Q is placed at a mid point between the two charges of + q each.

           Question 7.
           <br/>
           (a) State the underlying principle of a moving
           <br/>
           coil galvanometer.
           <br/>
           (b) Give two reasons to explain why a galvanometer cannot as such be used to measure the value of the current in a given circuit
           <br/>
           (c) Define the terms:
           <br/>
           (i) voltage sensitivity and
           <br/>
           (ii) current sensitivity of a galvanometer. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The Principle : When a current flows through the conductor coil, a torque acts on it due to the external radial magnetic field. Counter torque due to suspension balances coil after appropriate deflection due to current in the circuit.
           <br/>
           (b) A galvanometer can be used as such to measure current due to following two reasons.
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            A galvanometer has a finite large resistance and is connected in series in the circuit, so it will increase the resistance of circuit and hence change the value of current in the circuit.
           </li>
<li>
            A galvanometer is a very sensitive device, it gives a full scale deflection for the current of the order of micro ampere, hence if connected as such it will not measure current of the order of ampere.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           (c) (i) Voltage sensitivity : It is defined, as the deflection produced in the galvanometer when a unit voltage is applied across it.
           <br/>
           (ii) Current Sensitivity: The ratio of deflection produced by the coil Φ to the current in the coil is called the current sensitivity. It is the deflection of the meter per unit current.

<br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Self-inductance : Self-inductance of a coil is numerically equal to the amount of magnetic flux linked with the coil when and current flows through the coil. The S.I. unit of Self-inductance is henry (H) or weber per Ampere lH = 1 wb/A
           <br/>
           (b) The force on the side AB of rectangle is attractive as current is flowing in the same direction and on side CD will be repulsive the current is flowing in opposite direction with respect to straight conductor. The resultant magnetic force. On sides AD and BC is zero. The side AB is the straight wire. So, the net force will be attractive and rectangular loop will move towards the straight wire.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Unpolarized light : The light having vibration of electric field vector in all possible directions perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation the light is known as unpolarized light.

<br/>
           When a charged particle enter in a magnetic field making angle at 30°. Then velocity component is resolved into 2 components, v cos θ (along the magnetic field) and v sin θ (normal to the magnetic field). As the charged particle moves along XY- plane due to velocity component v sin θ, it also advances linearly due to the velocity component v cos θ. As a result, the charged particle will move in a helical path as shown in figure.

           (b) Show that density of nucleus is independent of its mass number A.  [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) In Rutherford’s scattering experiment of a-particle, it was observed that the fast and heavy a-particles could be deflected through 180°. But only very small number of particles i.e., 1 in about 8,000 a-particles are deflected through 180° that too from centre only. So by this it was assumed that the size of central part i.e., nucleus is about \(\frac{1}{10,000}th\) of
           <br/>
           the size of the atom and whole positive charge is concentrated in it.
           <br/>
           (b) Consider an atom whose mass number is A and R be the radius of the nucleus. If we neglect the mass of orbital electrons, then mass of the nucleus of the atom of mass number A = A a.m.u.

           State the underlying principle of a cyclotron. Explain its working with the help of a schematic diagram. Obtain the expression for cyclotron frequency.  [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Principle : It is based on a principle that a positive ion can acquire sufficiently large energy with a comparatively smaller alternating potential difference by making it to cross the same electric field again and again by making use of a strong magnetic field.

<br/>
           Working: The positive ions are produced from the source at the centre are accelerated by a dee which is at negative potential at that moment. Due to the presence of perpendicular magnetic field the ion will move in a circular path inside the dees. The magnetic field and the frequency of a.c source are so chosen that as the ions comes out of a dee, it changes its polarity and the ion is further accelerated and moves with higher velocity along a circular path of greater radius. This phenomenon is continued till the ion reaches at the periphery of the dees where an deflecting plate deflects the accelerated ion on the target to be bombarded. Expression for cyclotron frequency Suppose a position ion with charge q moving with a velocity v, then
