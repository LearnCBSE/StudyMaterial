           Question 1:
           <br/>
           A ball is thrown vertically upwards. What is its momentum at the highest point ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Zero because velocity of ball is zero at the highest point of its motion.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 2:
           <br/>
           Degree Celsius and Kelvin are two units of measuring temperature. Which of these are SI and non-SI units ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Degree Celsius – Non-SI.
           <br/>
           Kelvin – SI.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 3:
           <br/>
           Why is crystallisation better than evaporation for the separation of mixtures ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In crystallisation, we obtain the components in the form of crystals which are the purest form of a substance and impurities are left in the mother liquor. Crystals are separated from the mother liquor. This is not possible in evaporation. Some solids may decompose on heating to dryness. Such solids cannot be purified by evaporation.

<br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Blood
           <br/>
           (b) Areolar
           <br/>
           (c) Bone
           <br/>
           (d) Cartilage.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 5:
           <br/>
           Water hyacinth floats on water. Why ? How is this tissue different from that of succulent plants ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Water hyacinth being aquatic plant floats on water as its parenchyma has lots of air spaces (aerenchyma) which store air and help it in remain afloat.
           <br/>
           Whereas in succulent plants it helps in storage of water.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 6:
           <br/>
           In each of the adjoining diagram, a force F is acting on an object of mass, m. The direction of displacement is from west to east shown by the longer arrow. Observe the diagrams carefully and state whether the work done by the force is negative, positive or zero.
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 9 Science Solved Set 2 6" class="thumbnail alignnone" height="73" loading="lazy" src="https://studygramhome.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/cbse-sample-papers-for-class-9-science-solved-set-2-6.png?w=296" width="296"/>
<br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           On observing the diagrams carefully we find as follows:
           <br/>
           (i) In first (extreme left side) figure, the force is acting in a direction perpendicular to displacement, Hence, work done by the force is zero.
           <br/>
           (ii) In second figure, force and displacement both are in same direction. So, the work done by the force is positive.
           <br/>
           (iii) In third (extreme right side) figure, the force and displacement are in mutually opposite directions, hence, the work done by the force is negative.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 7:
           <br/>
           Define power. Derive its SI unit. An electric bulb is rated 10 W. What does it mean? What is the energy consumed in joules if it is used for 5 minutes?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The rate of doing work or the rate of transfer of energy is known as the power.
           <br/>
           ∴ Power \(=\frac { work }{ time } \frac { w }{ t } \)
           <br/>
           SI unit of power is a watt. Power is said to be 1 watt (1 W) if rate of doing work islJ s
           <sup>
            -1
           </sup>
           .
           <br/>
           If an electric bulb is rated 10 W, it means that electric bulb supplied 10 J of energy per second.
           <br/>
           If the bulb is used for a time t = 5 min = 5 × 60 s = 300 s, then total energy consumed by it E = P.t = 10 × 300 = 3000 J.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 8:
           <br/>
           (a) What is reverberation of sound?
           <br/>
           (b) Draw a diagram depicting low pitched sound and high pitched sound. What is the main difference between the two ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Persistence of sound due to repeated reflection from walls and roof in an auditorium is called reverberation.
           <br/>
           (b) The diagrams have been shown below :
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 9 Science Solved Set 2 8" class="thumbnail alignnone" height="150" loading="lazy" src="https://studygramhome.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/cbse-sample-papers-for-class-9-science-solved-set-2-8.png?w=633" width="633"/>
<br/>
           High pitched sound has high frequency but low pitched sound has low frequency.

           Question 9:
           <br/>

           A substance A has high compressibility and can be easily liquefied. It can take the shape of any container. Predict the nature of the substance. Enlist four properties of this state of matter.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The substance A is a gas because gases have large empty spaces between the particles. It has high compressibility and can be easily liquefied.

           Describe the structure of mitochondria with special emphasis on its membrane coverings. How can we relate the structure of the membrane with the function ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Mitochondria are rod shaped or sausage shaped cell organelles which are known as powerhouse of the cell. They contain enzymes necessary for the oxidation of food during the process of respiration and for release of energy in the form of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate). ATP is also known as the energy currency of the cell. This energy is used by cell to perform various functions such a mechanical work and biosynthesis of new chemical compounds.
          </p>
<p>
           Mitochondria to bounded by double membranes. The outer membrane is porous and the inner membrane is deeply folded. These folds are known as cristae and they provide a large surface area for ATP- generating chemical reactions. Mitochondria have their own DNA, ribosomes and enzymes to manufacture their own proteins. So they are also known as semiautonomous bodies.

           Question 13:
           <br/>
           How can poultry farming be integrated with crop production ? How improved poultry breeds are developed in poultry farming ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Poultry is rearing of domesticated fowl, ducks, geese, turkeys and pigeons for their meat and eggs.
           <br/>
           Poultry feed consists of mashed cereals like wheat, maize, jowar, oil cakes, fish meat etc.
           <br/>
           Therefore they should be kept along with such crops in the fields, thus benefitting the farmer.
           <br/>
           The cross-breeding programmes between Indian and foreign poultry have developed improved poultry breeds. The new varieties have low maintenance requirements. The size of the egg laying bird is also reduced and it utilises more fibrous cheaper diets consisting of agricultural by products. They produce more eggs and broilers for meat. Hence, it is interesting to note that
           <br/>
           poultry is India’s most efficient converter of low fibre food-stuff (which is unfit for human consumption) into highly nutritious animal protein food.

           What factors are responsible for storage losses in agricultural produces and how they can be controlled and prevented ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Following factors may be responsible for losses of grains during storage :
           <br/>
           (i) Biotic factors : They include insects, rodents, bacteria, fungi and mites.
           <br/>
           (ii) Abiotic factors : They include inappropriate moisture and temperature in the place of storage.
           <br/>
           These factors cause poor quality, loss in weight, discolouration of produce, poor germinability and marketability of grains.
           <br/>
           These factors can be controlled by proper treatment and by systematic management of ware housing.
           <br/>
           Preventive measures include strict cleaning of produce before storage, proper drying of the produce first in sunlight and then in shade and fumigation using chemicals to kill pests.

           Question 14:
           <br/>
           Name the two types of diseases one caused by some external agents and other due to some internal disorder of the body.
           <br/>
           Mention any two causative agents.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Two types of diseases are :
           <br/>
           By external agent – Acquired diseases like Jaundice, Tuberculosis, Polio etc.
           <br/>
           By internal disorder – High blood pressure, Diabetes, Cancer etc.
           <br/>
           Causative agents – Causes may be malnourishment or pathogen or congenital or stress induced etc.
           <br/>
           For e.g., Malaria is caused by Plasmodium. Diabetes is caused due to insufficient insulin or insulin resistance.

           Question 15:
           <br/>
           Bhola and Rajni, who are studying in Class IX, were travelling in a train. Rajni observed a field with two crops growing simultaneously in a definite pattern. While Bhola was busy in playing with a video game. Rajni noticed that rows of bajra and lobia were grown in alternate rows. She asked her grandfather why bajra and lobia are grown together ?
           <br/>
           (i) On what basis are the two crops selected in this pattern ?
           <br/>
           (ii) How does this practice benefit the farmer ?
           <br/>
           (iii) State any two values in Rajni’s behaviour here that differentiate her from Bhola.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) This is inter-cropping.
           <br/>
           The crops selected for such type of pattern should have different types of nutritional requirements. This will help the crops to utilise maximum nutrients from the soil.
           <br/>
           (ii) This pattern prevents pests and diseases to spread in all plants of one crop thereby preventing losses.
           <br/>
           (iii) Values that differentiate Rajni from Bhola are :
           <br/>
           (a) Awareness
           <br/>
           (b) Concern

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Velocity-time graph is shown in figure.
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 9 Science Solved Set 2 16" class="thumbnail alignnone" height="213" loading="lazy" src="https://studygramhome.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/cbse-sample-papers-for-class-9-science-solved-set-2-16.png?w=239" width="239"/>
<br/>
           The Slope of the graph is given by \(\frac { BD }{ AD } \). However, from the
           <br/>
           graph it is dear that BD = EA = v – u, and AD = OC = t.
           <br/>
           ∴ slope of velocity -time graph = \(\frac { BD }{ AD } \) = \(\frac { v – u }{ t } \)
           <br/>
           But \(\frac { v – u }{ t } \) rate of change of velocity = acceleration ‘a’
           <br/>
           So, we conclude that the slope of the velocity-time graph gives the acceleration of the object.
           <br/>
           (b) Here u = 0, a = 3 m s’2 and t = 35 s
           <br/>
           ∴  final velocity v = u + at = 0 + 3 × 35 = 105 m s

           <br/>
           (ii) Why is ‘G’ called as universal constant ?
           <br/>
           (iii) What happens to the gravitational force between two objects if masses of both the objects are doubled and the distance between them is also doubled ?

           <br/>
           (v) What is the value of ‘g’ on moon ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) The gravitational force between two objects is (a) directly proportional to the product of their mases, and (b) inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
           <br/>
           (ii) G is called a universal constant because its value never changes under any condition.

           (a) Isotopes of an element are chemically similar.
           <br/>
           (b) An atom is electrically neutral.
           <br/>
           (c) Noble gases show least reactivity.

           (d) Ions are more stable than atoms.
           <br/>
           (e) Na+ has completely filled K and L shells.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Chemical properties of an element depend upon the atomic number. All the isotopes of an element have the same atomic number and therefore are chemically similar.
           <br/>
           (b) An atom has the equal number of positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons. Therefore atom is electrically neutral.
           <br/>
           (c) Noble gases contain 8 electrons in the outermost shell (2 in case of helium). This is the maximum capacity of the outermost shell. Hence they show least reactivity.
           <br/>
           (d) Ions are more stable than atoms because the former have an octet structure.
           <br/>
           (e) Electronic configuration of Na is
           <br/>
           K         L           M

            +
           </sup>
           is formed from Na by removing the electron from the M shell. Therefore it has the completely filled K and L shells.

           (b) Mention the preventive measures taken to control diseases of dairy animals.
           <br/>
           (c) What are the food requirements of dairy animals ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The shelter provided for the livestock depends on type of animals to be sheltered, number of animals and location of shelter.
           <br/>
           Good animal shelter should be clean, dry, airy and well-ventilated. It should be spacious, have proper disposal of wastes, arrangement of clean drinking water and protection of animals from environment factors, predators and diseases.
           <br/>
           (b) Cholera, diarrhoea and tuberculosis are a few examples of bacterial diseases of cattle. Viral disease are pox, rinderpest as well as foot and mouth disease.
           <br/>
           Aspergillosis is an example of fungal disease in cattle.
           <br/>
           Animal diseases can be prevented if animals are kept in clean, hygienic environment, if they are given regular bath, if their shelter prevent entry of germs and flies; if they are vaccinated at regular intervals.
           <br/>
           (c) The cattle feed consists of :
           <br/>
           (i) Roughage : It is a coarse and fibrous substance which has low nutrient content e.g., fodder, hay, straw and so on.
           <br/>
           (ii) Concentrate : It is rich in nutrients with very little fibrous or cellulose matter. Concentrate is provided by grains, seeds and oil cakes.

           Question 22:
           <br/>
           A string is stretched as shown and a ‘pulse’ is created along it. The stop watch is started, from its position A, when the pulse is in position X and is stopped, in its position B, when the ‘pulse’ has travelled back to its position ‘X’. Find the velocity of propagation of the pulse along the string.

<br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Distance covered by pulses – 2m + 2m – 4m Time taken t =45 s – (- 5 s) = 50 s
           <br/>
           Speed of pulse v = \(\frac { s }{ t } =\frac { 4\quad m }{ 50\quad s } \) =0.08m/s or 8 cm s

           Question 23:
           <br/>
           While determining the density of a copper piece using a spring balance and a measuring cylinder, Seema carried out the following procedure :
           <br/>
           (i) Noted the water level in the measuring cylinder without the copper piece.
           <br/>
           (ii) Immersed the copper piece in the water.
           <br/>
           (iii) Noted the water level in the measuring cylinder with the copper piece inside it.
           <br/>
           (iv) Removed the copper piece from the water and immediately weighed it using a spring balance.
           <br/>
           Which step in the procedure is wrong and why ? What should have been the correct step ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The step (iv) of the procedure is wrong because the copper piece just removed from the water is wet and on weighing it we shall not get the correct mass.
           <br/>
           The copper piece should be weighed only when it is completely dry.

</p>
<p>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The stem of the funnel is not closed with a cotton plug resulting in the escape of camphor.
           <br/>
           Ammonium chloride can also be purified by this method.
