           Important Questions of Light Reflection and Refraction Class 10 Science Chapter 11
          </h2>
<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           State one function of iris in human eye. (AI 2012)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Irish adark muscular diaphragm that controls the size of the pupil.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           State one function of the crystalline lens in the human eye. (Foreign 2012)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The crystalline lens of human eye focuses the light that enters the eye and form the image on the retina.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Define the term power of accommodation. Write the modification in the curvature of the eye lens which enables us to see the nearby objects clearly? (Delhi 2019)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length is called power of accommodation. The ciliary muscles modifies the curvature to some extent. The change in the curvature of the eye lens can thus change its focal length. When the ciliary muscles contract, the lens becomes thick and its focal length decreases, thus enables us to see nearby objects clearly.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Trace the sequence of events which occur when a bright light is focused on your eyes. (Delhi 2019)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When a bright light enters the eye then most of the refraction for the light rays entering the eye occurs at the outer surface of the cornea. Then, the crystalline lens merely provides the finer adjustment of focal length required to focus object at different distances on the retina. The pupil regulates and controls the amount of light entering the eye. At retina, the light-sensitive cells get activated upon illumination and generate electric signals. These signals are sent to the brain via the optic nerves. The brain interprets these signals and finally, processes the information so that we perceive objects as they are.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Write about power of accommodation of human eye. Explain why the image distance in the eye does not change when we change the distance of an object from the eye? (Delhi 2017)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length is called power of accommodation.
           <br/>
           The ciliary musqles modifies the curvature to some extent. The change in the curvature of the eye lens can thus change its focal length. Thus, the focal length of the human lens increases or decreases depending on the distance of the object value to this distance of the image does not change. For example, when the ciliary muscles are relaxed, the lens becomes thin and its focal length increases, thus enables us to see distant object clearly.

           Question 9.
           <br/>
           (a) List the parts of the human eye that control the amount of light entering into it. Explain how they perform this function?
           <br/>
           (b) Write the function of retina in human eye. (3/5, AI2014)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The part of the human eye that controls the amount of light entering into it is pupil.
           <br/>
           Light enters the eye through a thin membrane called the cornea. It forms the transparent bulge on the front surface of the eyeball most of the refraction for the light rays entering the eye occurs at the outer surface of the cornea, the crystalline lens merely provides the linear adjustment of focal length required to focus objects at different distances on the retina. Iris which is behind the cornea controls the size of the pupil. The pupil regulates and controls the amount of light entering the eye.
          </p>

</ul>
<p>
           Myopia can be caused due to following reasons.
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Elongation of eyeball.
           </li>
<li>
            Excessive curvature of eye lens.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Hypermetropia can be caused due to following reasons.
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Shortening of eyeball.
           </li>
<li>
            Focal length of eye lens becomes too long.

           A student is unable to see clearly the words written on the black board placed at a distance of approximately 3 m from him. Name the defect of vision the boy is suffering from. State the possible causes of this defect and explain the method of correcting it. (3/5, 2018)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Student is suffering from myopia.
           <br/>
           The two possible reasons due to which the defect of vision arises are : excessive curvature of the eye lens and elongation of the eye ball.
           <br/>
           A student with myopia has the far point nearer than infinity, thus, the image of a distant object is formed in front of the retina.
           <br/>

           How and why should we organise groups to motivate the community members to donate their eyes after death? (2/5, AI 2014)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Yes, we know that the corneal – impairment can be cured by replacing the objective cornea with the cornea of the donated eye. We can provide the importance of eye donation to the community members. Our eyes can live even after our death. By donating our eyes after die, we can light the life of a blind person. The human eye is one of the most valuable and sensitive sense organs. It enables us to see the wonderful world and colours around us. It is however, impossible to identify colours while closing the eyes. Thus of all the sense organs, the human eye is the most significant one as it enables as to see the beautiful colourful word around us. Hence, we should donate our eyes after death.

           Question 31.
           <br/>
           How will you use two identical glass prisms so that a narrow beam of white light incident on one prism emerges out of the second prism as white light? Draw and label the ray diagram. (2020)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Newton was the first to use a glass prism to obtain the spectrum of a white light. He then placed a second identical prism in an inverted position with respect to the first prism. This allowed all the colours of the white light to pass through the second prism combining to form a white light emerging from the other side of the second prism. This made him believe that white light was composed of different colours.

           Question 32.
           <br/>
           Differentiate between a glass slab and a glass prism. What happens when a narrow beam of
           <br/>
           (i) a monochromatic light and (ii) white light passes through (a) glass slab and (b) glass prism? (2020)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Glass slab:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            It is a substance made of glass having three dimension and has cuboidal structure.
           </li>
<li>
            It does not deviate the path of light falling on it but produces a lateral displacement of the light ray after refraction. The incident and emergent ray are parallel to each other.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Glass prism:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            A prism is a structure made of glass with two triangle bases and three rectangular lateral surfaces. These surfaces are inclined to each other.
           </li>
<li>
            A prism deviates the path of light ray falling on it. Here the incident ray and emergent ray are not parallel to each other.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           (i) When a narrow beam of monochromatic light falls on a
           <br/>
           (a) glass slab, it gets refracted at its surface and the emergent ray is laterally displaced from the incident ray.
           <br/>
           (b) prism, it gets refracted at the surface and the light gets deviated from its initial path. The angle between the incident ray and emergent ray is known as angle of deviation.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) When a white light passes through a
           <br/>
           (a) glass slab, the light does not undergo dispersion as its two refracting surfaces are parallel to each other. The white light is laterally displaced from its initial path.
           <br/>
           (b) prism, the white light undergoes dispersion and splits into its constituent colours along with deviation from its initial path.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 33.
           <br/>

           Question 34.
           <br/>
           What is rainbow? Draw a labelled diagram to show the formation of a rainbow. (Delhi 2019)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           After a rain-shower, the sunlight gets dispersed by tiny droplets, present in the atmosphere. The water droplets acts like small glass prisms. They refract and disperse the incident sunlight, then reflect it internally, and finally refract it again when it comes out of the raindrop. Due to dispersion of light and internal reflection, different colours reaches the observers eye, which is called a rainbow.

           Question 35.
           <br/>
           What is ‘dispersion of white light’? State its cause. Draw a ray diagram to show the dispersion of white light by a glass prism. (AI 2017)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Splitting of white light into its seven constituent colours due to refraction is known as dispersion of white light.
           <br/>
           Cause of dispersion : When a beam of white light enters a prism, it gets refracted and splits into seven constituent colours. The splitting of the light ray occurs due to the different bending angle for each colour. Thus, each colour ray when passing through the prism bends at different angles with respect to the incident beam, thus giving rise to a spectrum.

<br/>
           (i) The phenomenon of the splitting up of the white light into its constituents colours is called dispersion of light. Dispersion of light is caused due to, different constituents colours of light after different refractive indices to the material of the prism.

           Question 46.
           <br/>
           Give reasons:
           <br/>
           (i) The extent of deviation of a ray of light on passing through a prism depends on the colour.
           <br/>
           (ii) Lights of red colour are used for danger signals. (Foreign 2011)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) The extent of deviation of a ray of light on passing through a prism depends on the colour because the refractive index of glass for different colour is different. It depends on wavelength of a particular light.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Since the wavelength of light is maximum in the spectrum, its penetration power in the air is maximum and so we can see red colour from farther distances. Thus, danger signal uses red colour.

<p>
           Question 47.
           <br/>
           (a) Why do the component colours of incident white light split into a spectrum while passing through a glass prism, explain.
           <br/>
           (b) Draw a labelled ray diagram to show the formation of a rainbow. (4/5, Delhi 2017)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) When a beam of light incidents on a prism, it first gets refracted and splits into seven constituent colors. The splitting of the light ray occurs due to the different bending angle for each colour. Thus each colour ray when passing through the prism bends at different angles with respect to the incident beam. This gives rise to the formation of the spectrum.

<p>
           Due to atmospheric refraction, position of star visible from sun, is slightly different from its actual position. This apparent position of the star is not stationary, but keeps on changing with change in physical condition on earths atmosphere. Since the stars are very distant, they are approximately point-sized sources of light. As the path of rays of light coming from the star goes on varying slightly, the apparent position of the star fluctuates and the amount of starlight entering the eye flickers the star sometimes appears brighter, and at some other time, fainter, which is the twinkling effect.

           Question 51.
           <br/>
           Explain why the planets do not twinkle. (Foreign 2015)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Planets do not emit light. However, they become visible due to reflection of light falling on them. The planets are much closer to the earth and thus can be considered as the extended source of light. The fluctuations in the light coming from various points of the planet due to atmospheric refraction get averaged out. As a result, no twinkling of planets is seen.

           <br/>
           (a) Advanced sun-rise
           <br/>
           (b) Delayed sun-set
           <br/>
           (c) Twinkling of stars (Foreign 2016)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a, b): The Sun is visible to us about 2 minutes before the actual sunrise, and about 2 minutes after the actual sunset because of atmospheric refraction. By actual sunrise, we mean the actual crossing of the horizon by the Sun. Figure shows the actual and apparent positions of the Sun with respect to the horizon. The time difference between actual sunset and the apparent sunset is about 2 minutes. The apparent flattening of the Sun’s disc at sunrise and sunset is also due to the same phenomenon.

<p>
           Question 56.
           <br/>
           A star appears slightly higher (above) than its actual position in the sky. Illustrate it with the help of a labelled diagram. (AI2012)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A star appears slightly above than its actual position in the sky. Since the starlight, on entering the earth’s atmosphere undergoes refraction continuously in a medium of gradually changing refractive index, before it reaches the earth. Since the atmosphere bends starlight towards the normal, the star appears slightly above than its actual position.

<p>
           Question 62.
           <br/>
           Consider the following reasons for the reddish appearance of the sun at the sunrise or the sunset:
           <br/>
           (A) Light from the sun near the horizon passes through thinner layers of air.
           <br/>
           (B) Light from the sun covers larger distance of the earths atmosphere before reaching our eyes.
           <br/>
           (C) Near the horizon, most of the blue light and shorter wavelengths are scattered away by the particles.
           <br/>
           (D) Light from the sun near the horizon passes through thicker layers of air.
           <br/>
           The correct reasons are
           <br/>
           (a) A and C only
           <br/>
           (b) B, C and D
           <br/>
           (c) A and B only
           <br/>
           (d) C and D only (2020)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (b) Near the horizon, the light rays from the sun has to travel a larger distance through the Earth’s atmosphere as compared to when it is away from the horizon. Thus, when this light travels through the atmosphere, most of short wavelength lights are scattered away causing the reddish appearance of the sun.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 63.
           <br/>
           What will be the colour of the sky when it is observed from a place in the absence of any atmosphere? (Delhi 2012)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           If the earth had no atmosphere, there would not have been any scattering. Then, the sky would look dark.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 64.
           <br/>
           Give an example of a phenomenon where Tyndall effect can be observed. (AI 2011)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The phenomenon of scattering of light by the colloidal particle give rise to Tyndall effect.
           <br/>
           This phenomenon is seen when a fine beam of sunlight enters a smoke-filled room through a small hole. This can also be observed when sunlight passes through a canopy of a dense forest.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 65.
           <br/>
           Why is the colour of clear sky blue? (Foreign 2011)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When sunlight passes the atmosphere, the fine particles in air scatter blue colour more strongly than red. This scattered blue light enters our eye and the colour of clear sky appears blue.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 66.
           <br/>
           Why is Tyndall effect shown by colloidal particles? State four instance of observing the Tyndall effect. (2020)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The phenomenon of scattering of light by the colloidal particles give rise to Tyndall effect. When a beam of light strike colloidal particles, the path of the beam becomes visible. This is known as Tyndall effect.
          </p>
<p>
           This phenomenon can be observed when
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            sunlight passes through a canopy of dense forest, when tiny water droplets in the mist scatter light.
           </li>
<li>
            torch light is switched on in a foggy environment, light rays are visible after being scattered by the fog particles in the surrounding air.
           </li>
<li>
            a fine beam of sunlight enters a smoke-filled room through a small hole.
           </li>
<li>
            shining a flashlight beam into a glass of dilated milk produces Tyndall effect.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Question 67.
           <br/>
           Draw a labelled diagram to show (i) reddish appearance of the sun at the sunrise or the sunset and (ii) white appearance of the sun at noon when it is overhead. (2020)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
<img alt="Light Reflection and Refraction Class 10 Important Questions with Answers Science Chapter 10 Img 18" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-146838" height="157" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Light-Reflection-and-Refraction-Class-10-Important-Questions-with-Answers-Science-Chapter-10-Img-18.png" width="295"/>
<br/>
           At sun-rise and the sun-set, light from the sun passes through thicker layers of air and larger distance in the earth’s atmosphere. As the red colour has longest wavelength hence, it is least scattered by the air and dust particles. So, the sun appears reddish.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) At noon, when sun is overhead, the distance to be travelled is least. All wavelengths are scattered equally and hence sun appears white.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 68.
           <br/>
           (a) State the relation between colour of scattered light and size of the scattering particle.
           <br/>
           (b) The apparent position of an object, when seen through the hot air, fluctuates or waves. State the basic cause of this observation.
           <br/>
           (c) Complete the path of white light when it passes through two identical prisms placed as shown
           <br/>
<img alt="Light Reflection and Refraction Class 10 Important Questions with Answers Science Chapter 10 Img 19" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-146839" height="101" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Light-Reflection-and-Refraction-Class-10-Important-Questions-with-Answers-Science-Chapter-10-Img-19.png" width="182"/>
<br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The colour of scattered light depends on the size of the scattering particle. Very fine particles scatter short wavelengths such as blue and violet, lights. Large size particles scatter light of longer wavelengths.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) The basic cause of this observation is atmospheric refraction. As hot air is less denser then the colder air surrounding it, it has a slightly lower refractive index. Since the physical condition of the refracting medium, in air is not stationary, the apparent position of an object, when seen through hot air fluctuates.
          </p>
<p>
           (c) Refer to answer 31.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 69.
           <br/>
           With the help of a labelled diagram, explain why the sun appears reddish at the sun-rise and the sun-set. (Delhi 2015)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Refer to answer 67(i).
          </p>
<p>
           Question 70.
           <br/>
           What is meant by scattering of light? Use this phenomenon to explain why the clear sky appears blue or the sun appears reddish at sunrise. (AI 2015)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The phenomenon by which a beam of light is redirected in many different directions when it interacts with a particle of matter is known as scattering of light.
           <br/>
           Refer to answer 65 and 67(i).
          </p>
<p>
           Question 71.
           <br/>
           Explain giving reason why the sky appears blue to an observer from the surface of the Earth. What should the appearance of the sky be during the day for an astronaut staying in the international space station orbiting the Earth? State reason to justify your answer. (Foreign 2015)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Refer to answer 65.
           <br/>
           For an astronaut staying in the international space station orbiting the Earth, the appearance of the sky will be black due to absence of air molecules to scatter the light coming from the Sun.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 72.
           <br/>
           State the difference in colours of the sun observed during sunrise/sunset and noon. Give explanation for each. (Delhi 2013)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           During sunrise or sunset, the suns rays pass through a maximum length of the atmosphere. Most of the blue and shorter wavelength get scattered. Only the red colour of light reaches the observer. That is why the Sun observed during sunset and sunrise appear red. At noon, the distance to be travelled is least. All wavelengths are scattered equally and hence sun appears white.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 73.
           <br/>
           Why does the sun appear reddish early in the morning? Will this phenomenon be observed by an astronaut on the Moon? Give reason to justify your answer. (3/5, 2018)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Refer to answer 67(i).
           <br/>
           This phenomenon cannot be seen by an astronaut on the moon because there is no atmosphere on moon to scatter the light.
