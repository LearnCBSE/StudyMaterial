           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Discuss within your group in what way is the story of the Fox’s school applicable to your classroom. How can the issue of inclusion of students with different abilities be addressed in the best possible way ?
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
<p>
           Group activity at classroom level. Some additional information is given below to enable the students to discuss the point in detail and with conviction :
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           The story of the Fox’s school is fully applicable to the classroom. If the students have a liking for a particular subject, they will learn it in the best manner. For instance, a student likes to study sports as he excels in it. He will do best in it if he is given sports as the main subject. But if he is forced to learn or study Sanskrit, he will miserably fail.
          </p>
<p>
           In such a backdrop, students must be identified as per their liking and inherent traits. Then they should be sent to those classes or subjects which cater to their talent and traits. Thus the issue of inclusion of students with different abilities can be addressed in this way.
          </p>
<p>
           Additionally, students identified with different abilities can be groomed by specialised courses. These should be relating to their inherent abilities and talents from the beginning. For instance, a student showing a potential for cricket can be sent to a cricket school to brighten in cricket. Going this way would bring in great results.

<strong>
            SUMMARY
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           At 16 years of age Babar Ali is, perhaps, the youngest headmaster in the world. He is incharge of teaching hundreds of students in his family’s backyard. These students are, indeed, poor and from his village. This young man is from Murshidabad in West Bengal.
          </p>
<p>
           Babar Ali’s day starts early. He jumps on an auto-rickshaw after doing household chores and reaches the Raj Govinda School. It is at a distance of ten kms. Babar Ali has to walk two kms to reach it. The school is neat and clean. It is fully equipped with furniture and dedicated teachers.
          </p>
<p>
           Babar Ali sits in the middle in the front row. He is a tall, slim, smart and studious teenager wearing a blue and white uniform. He is a model student and first member of his family to get a proper education.
          </p>
<p>
           Raj Govinda school is govt, run and so it is free. Babar Ali has to pay for his uniform, books and rickshaw. It costs around 1800 rupees a year to send him to school. Many poor families can’t afford to send their children to the school.
          </p>
<p>
           Chumki Hajra, 14-years old, has never been to school. She lives in a tiny shack. Every morning she scrubs the dishes instead of going to school. She has bee^ doing this work since she was five. Her father is handicapped and can’t work. But Chumki is getting education with hundreds of other poor children, thanks to Babar Ali. Babar Ali rushes back to his school from Raj Govinda school after it is over. He reaches it at 4 O’clock. A bell summons all children to his house. He now acts as head¬master of his own unofficial school.
          </p>
<p>
           Babar Ali gives the lessons the way he gets from his teachers. The children sit in the mud, some on rickety benches while family chickens scratch around here and there. His school has 800 students all from poor families, all taught free. He was just nine when he began teaching a few friends as a game. He says that in the beginning he play-acted. But later he realised that they won’t learn to read and write if they didn’t have proper lessons. He calls it his duty to educate them to help our country build a better future.
          </p>
<p>
           There are ten teachers at his school. They volunteer their services free. Ali doesn’t charge for anything. Books, food etc, are free and funded by donations. He admits that without his school they won’t be ever literate.
          </p>
<p>
           There are about twelve other girls besides Chumki Hajra. Her dedication is incredible as she works, in homes in the village from six in the morning till 2 pm. Then she heads for Ali’s school. She dreams to become a nurse one day. With that in her mind she is attending Ali’s school. The school has been recognized by the local authorities as it has helped increase literacy rates in the area. Babar Ali has won many awards for his work.
          </p>

           The youngest children are just four or five. There are a couple of electric bulbs to give light when it is dark. There are little problems when seasons change. The monsoon comes and children hurry for cover. They crowd under a piece of plastic sheeting. Babar Ali shouts an order. Lessons are cancelled as rain disrupts the working. The children hurry home through the downpour. Tomorrow they will be back though.

You are a pathfinder tor the youth of the country irl doing something useful for it. In this way you are an inspirer for thousands of such children.
