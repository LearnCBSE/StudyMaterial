           </strong>
<br/>
           This incident happened during the time when Lai Bahadur Shastri was working as Railway Minister. Once he was to visit a place called Sevapuri near Varanasi and he travelled by train to reach the place. Sevapuri railway platform was not of adequate height. As the gap between the train compartment ramp and the plat­form was deep, it became very difficult for Lai Bahadur Shastri who was short in stature, to get down from the train. On seeing the plight of Lai Bahadhur Shastri, four lady passengers commented jokingly : “Now the Railway Minister can under­stand well the hardship caused to ladies due to inadequate height of the railw
           <sup>
            r
           </sup>
           ay platforms.” Lai Bahadur Shastri somehow got down the train and ordered the sta­tion master to get a crow-bar and spade. He started digging the mud and raising the platform height by filling it with mud. Inspired bv the examplary behaviour of Lai Bahadur Shastri, many passengers joined and within three hours, the platform height was increased.
           <br/>
<strong>
            Imagine you were a journalist and one among the passengers. Write a newspaper report on this incident.

            15.Read the following story.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            The Little White Cat
           </strong>
<br/>
           Once upon a time there was a little white cat. She thought she was black. Her brother and sister were black and her parents were black. But she was white.
           <br/>
           When the little white cat grew, she thought of her career. She wished to become a witch’s cat. So she went to her mum and said, “Goodbye, mum ! I’m going to be a witch’s cat !’
           <br/>
           ‘Oh, that’s nice !’’ said the little white cat’s mum. ‘Goodbye ! Come and see us soon’. The little white cat went in search of a witch. She found a witch and expressed her wish. But the witch said, “No you cannot be my cat. Because you’re white. Go away !’.
           <br/>
           The little white cat searched and found another witch. She was lucky because she was in Scotland, and there are a lot of witches in Scotland. She found a witch and told her wish. The witch rejected with the same reason. The poor little cat had no job, no money or food. She was hungry and weak. She did not lose hope. She continued her search.
           <br/>
           At last she came to a cottage. There was a chimney sweep sitting behind the cottage. He was eating his lunch : sandwitches and cake. He saw the little white cat and invited her to have a sandwich. The little cat thanked him. She saw some black soot and put her paw, then her leg and her whole body into it. She turned black. The chimney sweep said, “You’re black now. This is a witch’s cottage ! You can go and see her at the front door.”
           <br/>
           The little white cat – now a little black cat walked to the front door. The witch was sitting in her rocking chair, eyes closed.
           <br/>
           ‘Hello ! Have you got a cat ?’
           <br/>
           ‘Hello ! No, I haven’t got a cat.’
           <br/>
           ‘Well, I’m your cat !’ said the little white cat. ‘Oh, that’s nice ! Jump on my knee. Oh, you are a nice little cat ! The witch stroked the little white cat, the little black cat. Then she said, ‘What a pity ! I can’t see you because I’m blind.’
           <br/>

            16.Read the following passage.
           </strong>
<br/>
           In this world we can now begin a little to understand things, and a little to master them by help of science, which has forced its way step by step against religion, and against the opposition of all the old precepts. Science can help us to get over this craven fear in which mankind has lived for so many generations. Science can teach us, and I think our own heart can teach us, no longer to look around for imaginary supports, no longer to invent allies in the sky, but rather to look to our own efforts here below to make this world a fit place to live in instead of the sort of place that the churches in all these centuries have made it.
           <br/>
           Religion is based, primarily and mainly, upon fear. It is partly the terror of the unknown, and partly, as I have said, the wish to feel to stand against all troubles and disputes. Fear is the basis of the whole thing-fear of the mysterious, fear of defeat, fear of death. Fear is the parent of cruelty and therefore it is no wonder if cruelty and religion have gone hand-in-hand. It is because fear is at the basis of these two things.

            12.Read the passage given below.
           </strong>
<br/>
           This incident happened during the time when Lai Bahadur Shastri was working as Railway Minister. Once he was to visit a place called Sevapuri near Varanasi and he travelled by train to reach the place. Sevapuri railway platform was not of adequate height. As the gap between the train compartment ramp and the plat­form was deep, it became very difficult for Lai Bahadur Shastri who was short in stature, to get down from the train. On seeing the plight of Lai Bahadhur Shastri, four lady passengers commented jokingly : “Now the Railway Minister can under­stand well the hardship caused to ladies due to inadequate height of the railw
           <sup>
            r
           </sup>
           ay platforms.” Lai Bahadur Shastri somehow got down the train and ordered the sta­tion master to get a crow-bar and spade. He started digging the mud and raising the platform height by filling it with mud. Inspired bv the examplary behaviour of Lai Bahadur Shastri, many passengers joined and within three hours, the platform height was increased.
           <br/>
<strong>
            Imagine you were a journalist and one among the passengers. Write a newspaper report on this incident.

           <br/>
           The platform of Sevapuri Railway Station was not high to set foot. It became difficult for our short man ‘Lai Bahadur Shastri’ due to the gap between the train compartment ramp and platform. Some women wished that Shastriji should un­derstand the trouble of these steps to women.
           <br/>
           Shastriji got down the train, ordered for a crow-bar and spade, started to elevate the height of platform. Some of the passengers shared the work and very soon the required work was done. The people on the platform hailed Shastriji for his humility. The women who made fun of him thanked him after their apologies.

           <br/>
           Hai ! It’s a pleasure to write to you and I could not stop myself after receiving your anxious letter ! Sujith, why are you so frustrated ? Why are you not confident of yourself ? As far as I know, you were active, diligent and positive.
           <br/>
           Here is a piece of advice from my side. First of all organize your work, do it meticulously and aim at your target. Try to garner all the difficulties in your studies and sort them out in the order of difficulty. Work out on these aspects either with the help of your teachers or take special coaching for a few days. But remem­ber, self-study is very important. Plan your work and work you plan. Test yourself from time to time and observe your progress.
           <br/>
           One more thing I want to emphasize is your attention. Do not get distracted with any deviation. Remember your goal. Be social but avoid unnecessary abjections. Do not be allowed for false exultations. Keep up the fidelity in you for your aca­demic goals.
           <br/>
           O.K. ! I hope you must have been rejuvenated with this friend’s suggestions ! Write to me whenever you are in desperation. I’m ready with my boosting ! Be in touch.

<strong>
            The Little White Cat
           </strong>
<br/>
           Once upon a time there was a little white cat. She thought she was black. Her brother and sister were black and her parents were black. But she was white.
           <br/>
           When the little white cat grew, she thought of her career. She wished to become a witch’s cat. So she went to her mum and said, “Goodbye, mum ! I’m going to be a witch’s cat !’
           <br/>
           ‘Oh, that’s nice !’’ said the little white cat’s mum. ‘Goodbye ! Come and see us soon’. The little white cat went in search of a witch. She found a witch and expressed her wish. But the witch said, “No you cannot be my cat. Because you’re white. Go away !’.
           <br/>
           The little white cat searched and found another witch. She was lucky because she was in Scotland, and there are a lot of witches in Scotland. She found a witch and told her wish. The witch rejected with the same reason. The poor little cat had no job, no money or food. She was hungry and weak. She did not lose hope. She continued her search.
           <br/>
           At last she came to a cottage. There was a chimney sweep sitting behind the cottage. He was eating his lunch : sandwitches and cake. He saw the little white cat and invited her to have a sandwich. The little cat thanked him. She saw some black soot and put her paw, then her leg and her whole body into it. She turned black. The chimney sweep said, “You’re black now. This is a witch’s cottage ! You can go and see her at the front door.”
           <br/>
           The little white cat – now a little black cat walked to the front door. The witch was sitting in her rocking chair, eyes closed.
           <br/>
           ‘Hello ! Have you got a cat ?’
           <br/>
           ‘Hello ! No, I haven’t got a cat.’
           <br/>
           ‘Well, I’m your cat !’ said the little white cat. ‘Oh, that’s nice ! Jump on my knee. Oh, you are a nice little cat ! The witch stroked the little white cat, the little black cat. Then she said, ‘What a pity ! I can’t see you because I’m blind.’

            16.Read the following passage.
           </strong>
<br/>
           In this world we can now begin a little to understand things, and a little to master them by help of science, which has forced its way step by step against religion, and against the opposition of all the old precepts. Science can help us to get over this craven fear in which mankind has lived for so many generations. Science can teach us, and I think our own heart can teach us, no longer to look around for imaginary supports, no longer to invent allies in the sky, but rather to look to our own efforts here below to make this world a fit place to live in instead of the sort of place that the churches in all these centuries have made it.
           <br/>
           Religion is based, primarily and mainly, upon fear. It is partly the terror of the unknown, and partly, as I have said, the wish to feel to stand against all troubles and disputes. Fear is the basis of the whole thing-fear of the mysterious, fear of defeat, fear of death. Fear is the parent of cruelty and therefore it is no wonder if cruelty and religion have gone hand-in-hand. It is because fear is at the basis of these two things.
