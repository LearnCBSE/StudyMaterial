<strong>
             Question 1:
             <br/>
</strong>
</span>
           Listen to the first part of the tape, and answer the two questions you are asked. Then listen to the rest of the tape, and answer the following questions:
           <br/>
<strong>
            (a)
           </strong>
           Now that you have heard the rest of the extract, what do you now think has happened to the boys? What do you think happened to the plane they were flying in?
           <br/>
<strong>
            (b)
           </strong>
           What happened to the other part of the plane?
           <br/>
<strong>
            (c)
           </strong>
           How did Ralph attract the attention of the other boys?
           <br/>
<strong>
            (d)
           </strong>
           What were the names of the first three boys who came to the meeting?
           <br/>
<strong>
            (e)
           </strong>
           Why do you think groups of boys were marching in two parallel lines?
           <br/>
<strong>
            (f)
           </strong>
           Do you think there were any adults on the island? Why/Why not?
           <br/>
<strong>
            (g)
           </strong>
           Can you predict what happened to the boys next? For example, how did they organise themselves? What about shelter and food?
           <br/>

             Answer:
             <br/>
</strong>
</span>
<strong>
            (a)
           </strong>
           The boys were lost and were trying to find everyone else. The plane was shot and crashed on the island. Luckily, the part of the plane carrying the boys left unscathed and the boys were alive.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (b)
           </strong>
           The other part of the plane burnt and sank into the sea.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (c)
           </strong>
           He blew the conch to attract the attention of the other boys.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (d)
           </strong>
           Ralph, Piggy and Johny
           <br/>
<strong>
            (e)
           </strong>
           Probably they were members of a scout.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (f)
           </strong>
           The presence of only marching boys indicates there are no adults on the island.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (g)
           </strong>
           After arrival of the band of marching boys, they might have been escorted to the nearby village or town. Once they had reached the human habitation, they would have got shelter and food. There was another sad possibility of being caught by the enemy.
          </p>

<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Question 2:
             <br/>
</strong>
</span>
           Imagine that you are one of the boys, and that the map on the next page is the island on which you have landed. Your most urgent task is to decide where to live. Work in groups of four; decide where to set up camp, and the materials you will use. Be prepared to justify your choices to the rest of the class.

           Group I: I suggest we should eat some fruit and keep some for the rest of our journey.
           <br/>
           Group II: Why don’t we use bamboo for our defense?
           <br/>
           Group III: What about crossing the river? We may find a village on the other side.
           <br/>
           Group IV: We’d better be careful before crossing the river.
           <br/>
           Group I: Perhaps we ought to go inside the cave to spend night.
           <br/>
           Group II: Yea, that’s a good idea.
           <br/>
           Group III: That’s no good because there may be some animals inside the cave.
           <br/>
           Group IV: But what about the smoke coming from the hilltop?
           <br/>
           Since we are all small boys, so let us move in the direction of the billowing smoke. We may find a village and they may offer us food and shelter.

           They were dressed in strangely eccentric clothing: shorts, shirts and different garments they carried in their hands. Then- bodies from throat to ankle were hidden by black cloaks which bore a long silver cross on the left breast.
           <br/>
           The boy who controlled them came forward, vaulted on to the platform with his cloak flying and peered into what was almost complete darkness.
           <br/>
           “Where’s the man with the trumpet?” Ralph, sensing his sun blindness, answered him,
           <br/>
           “There’s no man with a trumpet only me.” The boy came close and peered down at Ralph screwing up his face. As he did so, he turned quickly,
           <br/>
           “Isn’t there a ship then?”
           <br/>
           He was tall, thin and bony. His face was crumpled aad freckled out. Out of his face stared two light blue eyes which were frustrated now and turning to anger,
           <br/>
           “Isn’t there a man here?
           <br/>
           Ralph spoke back to him, “No, we’re having a meeting. Come and join us.”

           The top priority should be to search for drinking water and food. A spring with clear water can be a great boon in such conditions. Otherwise, water from any running source is good. For food fruits are always plenty. We can look for fresh preferred by birds in the location as it will ensure that we are not trying a harmful fruit. Fish and eggs are good sources of food in these conditions.
           <br/>
           Ideal shelter can be on a treetop as it will save against harmful animals. Fire can be lit by hitting two stones or by rubbing a big stick vigorously. Fire will also save us against extreme cold, apart from keeping animals at bay.
           <br/>
           For escaping, the best way is to use some means of signaling so that rescue team can spot us. Smokes are used since time immemorial to send signals.
           <br/>
           Every effort should be made to conserve as much water as possible in these conditions.

            ‘A Week on Topo Island’
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           We were on a trip to the Topo Island Suddenly, a sea storm came and swept our small ship to an unknown island. The entire ship now looked like a huge wreckage. The island was dotted with many palm and coconut trees. The beach was beautiful with golden sand. All of us looked around but could not find a sign of human civilization. It was getting dark. We decided to set up a camp. We tore seat covers from the ship, took out ropes, searchlights and canisters of diesel and water. With the help of some tree twigs and seat covers we erected a makeshift tent. Then with the help of diesel we lit a bonfire. We could find some coconuts strewn around which were enough for all of us as dinner. During night we decided to keep a watch for any upcoming danger.
          </p>
<p>
           While I was enjoying my early morning slumber, a cacophony disturbed my sleep. While rubbing my eyes I could see a group of strangely dressed men and women running towards us. They were incessantly beating drums. All of us were too frightened to react. Once they came closer, they surrounded us with their spears directed towards us.
           <br/>
           Probably, they took us as harmless because of our age group. Later on, all of us were made to follow them. After a long trek of about an hour, we reached a small tribal village. We were offered fresh fruits and fishes to eat. All of us had had a sumptuous meal.
          </p>
<p>
           After much effort of making drawings in the sands, we could explain them about our plight. Their leader called a man who looked more modem as he was wearing a pair of trousers and shirt. He said that he was working for the government of India. After a long wait of about a week, the rescue helicopter landed which took us to the safe environs of our home.
