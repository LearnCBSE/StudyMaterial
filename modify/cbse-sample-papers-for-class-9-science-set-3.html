<br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Option (D) is correct
           <br/>
           Explanation: Eâ€™ectronic configuration of Mg atom = 2,8,2 and that of Mg
           <sup>
            2+
           </sup>
           ion = 2, 8
           <br/>
           Number of protons in Mg atom = 12
           <br/>
           Number of neutrons in Mg atom 24 â€“ 12 = 12 [as mass number of Mg atom = 24 and number of neutrons = mass number â€“ number of protons].
          </p>
<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Which one of the following sets of phenomena would increase on raising the temperature? [1]
           <br/>
           (A) Diffusion, evaporation, compression of gases
           <br/>
           (B) Evaporation, compression of gases, solubility
           <br/>
           (C) Evaporation, diffusion, expansion of gases
           <br/>
           (D) Evaporation, solubility, diffusion, compression of gases.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Option (D) is correct
           <br/>
           Explanation: Evaporation rate increases because on increasing temperature. kinetic energy of molecules increases, so the molecules present at the surface of the liquid leave the surface quickly and go into the vapour state.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           Diffusion and expansion of gases also increase as the molecules move more rapidly and try to occupy more space. As the temperature of the solution increases, the average kinetic energy of the solute molecules also increases. This causes the molecules to be less able to hold together and hence they dissolve more readily. Hence increase in temperature increases the solubility of solid states.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           A mixture of sulphur and carbon disulfide is: [1]
           <br/>
           (A) Heterogeneous and shows Tyndall effect
           <br/>
           (B) Homogeneous and shows Tyndall effect
           <br/>
           (C) Heterogeneous and does not show Tyndall effect
           <br/>
           (D) Homogeneous and does not show Tyndall effect.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Option (A) is correct
           <br/>
           Explanation: A mixture of sulphur and carbon disuiphide is a heterogeneous colloid and shows Tyndall effect. In a colloidal solution, the particles are big enough to scatter light. This phenomenon of scattering of light by colloidal particles is known as Tyndall effect.
          </p>

           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Which of the following figures does not represent Bohrâ€™s model of an atom correctly? [1]
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 9 Science Set 3 with Solutions 2" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-160628" height="70" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-9-Science-Set-3-with-Solutions-2.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-9-Science-Set-3-with-Solutions-2.png 580w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-9-Science-Set-3-with-Solutions-2-300x36.png 300w" width="580"/>
<br/>
           (A) (i) and (ii)
           <br/>
           (B) (ii) and (iii)
           <br/>
           (C) (ii) and (iv)
           <br/>
           (D) (i) and (iv)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Option (C) is correct.
           <br/>
           Explanation: Figures (ii) and (iv) do not correctly represent the Bohrâ€™s model of an atom. It is because maximum number of electrons in K (I) shell is 2, not 4, so (ii) is wrong and maximum capacity of L. (II) shell is 8 electrons, not 9. So, (iv) is also wrong.

           Question 14.
           <br/>
           The gravitational force between two objects is F. If masses of both objects are halved without changing distance between them, then the gravitational force would become: [1]
           <br/>
           (A) F/4
           <br/>
           (B) F2
           <br/>
           (C) F
           <br/>
           (D) 2F
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Option (A) is correct.
           <br/>
           Explanation: We know that, gravitational force,
           <br/>
           F = \(\frac{\mathrm{Gm}_1 \mathrm{~m}_2}{r^2}\)
           <br/>
           (G = Gravitational constant)
           <br/>
           where m
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           and m
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           are the masses of two objects respectively. And r is the distance between the
           <br/>
           two masses Now, according to the question, if masses of both objects are halved. i.e., m
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           = \( \frac{m_1}{2}\) and m
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           = \(\frac{m_2}{2}\)
           <br/>
           New force,
           <br/>
           F = \(\frac{G m_1^{\prime} m_2^{\prime}}{r^2}=\frac{G\left(\frac{m_1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{m_2}{2}\right)}{r^2}\)
           <br/>
           = \(\frac{1}{4} \frac{\mathrm{Gm}_1 \mathrm{~m}_2}{r^2}\)
           <br/>
           = \(\frac{F}{4}\) where \(\frac{\mathrm{Gm}_1 \mathrm{~m}_2}{r^2}\) = F
           <br/>
           So, new Force F = \(\frac{F}{4}\)
           <br/>
           Thus, the new gravitational force will become \(\frac{1}{4}\) times of its original gravitational force. I

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Endoplasmic reticulum is a membranous network enclosing a fluid-filled lumen. The two types of endoplasmic reticulum are Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (RER) and Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum (SER). RER has ribosomes attached to its surface. The ribosonies take part in protein synthesis.
          </p>
<p>
           SER does not have any ribosomes on it and secretes lipids. Some protcins and lipids synthesised in ER are used for producing new cellular parts, specially the cell membrane, by biogenesis.

           A body of mass 1000 kg moving at a speed of 10 rn/s reaches the speed of 50 miâ€™s in 20s. Calculate the force required to do so.[3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Initial velocity (u) = 100 m/s
           <br/>
           Final velocity (Î½) = 50 m/s
           <br/>
           Time (t) = 20s
           <br/>
           Mass (m) = 1000 kg
           <br/>
           Force = ms = m(v â€“ u)/t

           Question 32.
           <br/>
           What happens to the magnitude of the force of gravitation between two objects if:
           <br/>
           (a) mass of one of the objects is tripled?
           <br/>
           (b) distance between the objects is doubled?
           <br/>
           (c) mass of both objects is doubled? [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The force between two objects is given by â€˜Universal gravitation law.â€™ It is numerically stated as,
           <br/>
           F = \(\frac{\mathrm{G}\left(\mathrm{m}_1 \mathrm{~m}_2\right)}{d^2}\)
           <br/>
           (a) Mass of one object is tripled:
           <br/>
           Fâ€™ = \(\frac{\mathrm{G}\left(3 \mathrm{~m}_1\right) \mathrm{m}_2}{d^2}\)
           <br/>
           Fâ€™= \(\frac{3 G\left(m_1 m_2\right)}{d^2} \) = 3F
           <br/>
           Force will be tripled.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) Distance between the objects is double:
           <br/>
           Fâ€™ = \(\frac{\mathrm{G}\left(\mathrm{m}_1 \mathrm{~m}_2\right)}{(2 d)^2}\)
           <br/>
           F = \(\frac{G\left(m_1 m_2\right)}{4 d^2}\)
           <br/>
           F = \(\frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{\mathrm{Gm}_1 \mathrm{~m}_2}{d^2}\right)=\frac{\mathrm{F}}{4}\)
           <br/>
           Force will reduce to one-fourth of its previous value.
          </p>
<p>
           (c) Masses of both objects are doubled:
           <br/>
           Fâ€™ = \(\frac{G\left\{\left(2 m_1\right)\left(2 m_2\right)\right\}}{d^2}\)
           <br/>
           Fâ€™ = \(\frac{4 G\left\{m_1 m_2\right\}}{d^2}\) = 4F

           (a) Out of boiling and evaporation which is a surface phenomenon? Explain. In the absence of a refrigerator, butter is kept wrapped in a wet cloth during summer. Why?
           <br/>
           (b) Why does ice cream appear colder than water at the same temperature? [5]

           <br/>
           Classify different types of pure substances. Differentiate them on the basis of their chemical properties giving examples of each.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Evaporation is a surface phenomenon. Particles from the surface gain enough energy to overcome the forces of attraction present in the liquid and change into vapour state. Due to wet cloth, the temperature is comparatively lower than room temperature. So, butter does not melt when remain wrapped in wet clothes.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) It is because the fact that water has latent heat of fusion present in it. But ice cream is in solid form; i.e. it has released its latent heat fusion of while coming in solid state. So due to less energy of ice cream in comparison to that of water; ice cream appears cooler to mouth than that of water at the same temperature.
          </p>
<p>
           OR
           <br/>
           Two types of pure substances are elements and compounds.

           Question 39.
           <br/>
           Observe the diagram and answer the following below:
           <br/>
           Two forces F
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           =20 N and F
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           = 30 N are acting on an object as shown in figure:
           <br/>
           (a) Find the net force acting on the object.
           <br/>
           (b) State the direction of the net force acting on the object.
           <br/>
           (c) If the object still does not move under the application of these forces, what can be the possible reason for this? [4]
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Why no force is required to move an object with a constant velocity?
           <br/>

<br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Net force acting on the object = F
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           â€“ F
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           = 30 N-20N = 10N
           <br/>
           (b) Net force acts in the direction of force F
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           . As F
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           is greater than F
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           .
           <br/>
           (c) All forces acting on the object are balanced and that is why the object does not move. It needs unbalanced force for movement.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           We know, F = ma
           <br/>
           When velocity is constant, then acceleration, a = 0. Hence, F = 0. Hence, no force is required to move an object with constant velocity.
