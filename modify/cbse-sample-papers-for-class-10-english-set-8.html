           Reading Comprehension Through Unseen Passages
           <br/>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the following text. (10)
           <br/>
           1. Corruption, terrorism, communalism, greed for power and wealth and the list of ailments that affect modern society continues. More than half the population of India is below the age group of 25 and the future of the country will only be bright if youngsters are equipped to deal with these ailments.
          </p>
<p>
           2. A child is a storehouse of potential and it is essential to nurture and develop these attributes from a very young age. Since they spend much of their time in school, the curriculum in school should be such that it enables children to understand, care and practise ethical values like respect, justice and civic sense. Education should aim to develop a sense of rights and duties as well as moral values like honesty, responsibility and respect for others.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           3. Moral education should be directed towards enhancing a child’s ability to critically analyse situations, make decisions, empathise with people and work in cooperation towards a common goal.
          </p>
<p>
           4. As a means of direct instruction to students, schools are very influential in the character development of a child and the methods of education affect the development of morally upright citizens who can bring about a much-needed change in the country.
          </p>
<p>
           5. The youth of today have to face many problems like drug abuse, violent behaviour and family issues. If they are not taught morals, they would fail to differentiate between good and bad values. Hence, they would be incapable of dealing with different types of issues.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           A sound moral base would help a child make the right decisions, especially in an era where the youth is increasingly coming under the negative influence of the media.
          </p>
<p>
           6. Schools in India have introduced moral education as part of their curriculum because they realise that morally sound citizens are the need of the hour. Since most children look up to their teachers as role models, it is most appropriate that they be the facilitators of moral values.
          </p>
<p>
           7. Thus, schools should focus more on the personality development of children since it is one of the most important responsibilities of a school. Schools should take the initiative to mould children into better human beings so that they can make the world a better place to live in.
          </p>
<p>
           Answer the following question, based on the passage above.
           <br/>
           (i) Select the option that conveys the message, “Morally sound citizens are the need of the hour.” (1)

           <br/>

           <br/>
           (c) Developing moral qualities is the only way to solve these social issues.
           <br/>
           (d) Moral citizens can only be possible by giving moral education to the mass population.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (d) Moral citizens can only be possible by giving moral education to the mass population.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Why is it important to inculcate moral values since childhood? Answer in about 40 words.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Children are the future of a country. They have to face many problems in life.

<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Read the following text. (10)
          </p>
<p>
<img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 10 English Set 3 with Solutions 1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-102130" height="386" loading="lazy" src="https://www.cbsetuts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-English-Set-3-with-Solutions-1.png" width="487"/>
<br/>
           1. Demonetisation refers to an economic policy where a certain currency unit ceases to be used. It occurs whenever there is a change in the national currency. The existing form or forms of money is pulled from circulation and retired, to be replaced with new notes or coins. Sometimes, a country completely replaces the old currency with new currency.
          </p>
<p>
           2. On 8 November, 2016, the Indian government decided to demonetise the 500 and 1000 rupee notes, the two biggest denominations in its currency system. These notes accounted for 86% of the country’s circulating cash. With little warning, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced to the citizens that these notes would be rendered immediately ineffective with immediate effect. People were given time till the end of the year to deposit or exchange them for newly introduced 2000 rupee and 500 rupee flotes.
          </p>
<p>
           3. The government’s goal was to combat India’s thriving underground economy on several fronts:
           <br/>
           eradicate counterfeit currency, fight tax evasion (only 1% of the population pays taxes), eliminate black money accumulated from money laundering and terrorist financing activities, and to promote a cashless economy. Individuals and entities with huge sums of black money acquired from parallel cash systems were forced to take their large denomination notes to a bank, and account for them satisfactorily, and submit proof if tax paid. If the owner could not provide proof of making any tax payments on the cash, a penalty of 200% on the tax due was imposed.
          </p>
<p>
           4. Demonetisation had a severe impact on the gold market. The extraordinary demand for the yellow metal, made a stiff hike in the cost. However, the Government made it mandatory that every buyer had to submit his/her PAN card details for purchases made. Erring jewellers were brought to book.
          </p>
<p>
           5. Many Indians switched to alternative payment methods. The biggest gainers were mobile wallet companies that offered easy transactions through a large network of partners. Alibaba-backed Paytm saw a sevenfold increase in overall traffic. Prepaid cash cards were another option that the customers found useful. Other alternatives were mobile payment systems linked to e-commerce businesses like Ola Money, Freecharge, and Flipkart Wallet. (Source: The true picture)

           (iii) Justify the following, in about 40 words.
           <br/>
           The consequences of demonetisation was seen in the shifting of financial transactions to another platform that obviated the routes of dishonest dealings or running a parallel economy.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When the government imposed demonetisation for the ₹ 1000/- and 500/- currency and get the money deposited, business transactions through higher denominations became increasingly difficult. So many Indians switched to alternative payment methods like Paytm and other UPI mode of transactions. This led to a near-complete cashless economy. There could be no dishonest dealings through digital route anymore and black economy was greatly curtailed.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) Based on the passage, state any two points on which the Indian Government thrives to combat the underground economy.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Indian Government thrives to combat the underground economy:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            To eradicate counterfeit currency.
           </li>
<li>
            To fight tax evasion.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           (v) In the table given in the passage we see, “a great jump in the digital payment trends” from the financial year 2016 -17 to 2017-18. State one inference that can be drawn from this.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Carrying ‘hard cash’ was seen as unsafe while traveling and even getting mutilated and the problem of “change” became too tedious and time-consuming. Digital payment circumvented all these problems with easy payment methods.
          </p>
<p>
           (vi) Select the chart that appropriately represents the growth in volume of rupees in 3 financial years (2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18):

<p>
           (vii) List one reason why the government decided to demonetise the 500 and 1000 rupee notes and not any other. (Answer in about 40 words)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           500 and 1000 rupees notes accounted for 86% of the country’s circulating cash, hence by doing so, the government would be able to demonetise the two biggest denominations in its currency system.
          </p>
<p>
           (viii) Which of the following was the ultimate ‘triumph’ of demonetisation as per the passage?

           <br/>
           D. All of the above.

           <br/>
           Delhi
           <br/>
           Subject: Unhygienic condition of the school washrooms
           <br/>
           Sir,
           <br/>
           This is to bring to your kind notice that all the washrooms of our school are in a very bad condition since past few weeks. The cleaners are either unwell or on leave. The co-helpers are also not doing their work properly. They have developed a lethargic attitude. The washrooms stink badly which add to the dismal.
          </p>
<p>
           If the unhygienic condition continues like this, the students will fall sick. Clean washrooms are the basic necessity in any institution or organisation. Someone can be temporarily appointed in place of the main housekeeper until he joins back. I request you to kindly look into this, as it is a matter of serious concern, involving the health of the students.
          </p>
<p>
           Thanking you,
           <br/>

           <br/>
           Through the columns of your leading newspaper, I want to bring to the notice of the concerned authorities the nuisance created by stray animals in our locality and they have been roaming freely. Sometimes the animals block and slow down the traffic by ambling around the main road even in the peak hours of the day. On several occasions, they encroach into the lawns and parks and create a mess everywhere.
          </p>
<p>
           The residents have complained about this to the authorities many times but there has been no feasible solution yet. This has become a concern which would need immediate action from the concerned authorities. We hope the concerned authorities will take some remedial steps in this regard.
          </p>
<p>
           Thanking you,
           <br/>
           Yours sincerely,
           <br/>
           Raman Dey
          </p>

           Answer:
           <br/>
           Our world is suffering a great deal because of the rising problem of pollution. The smoke emitted vehicles has become a health hazard causing many respiratory diseases like asthma, bronchitis, etc. Also, noise pollution has greatly increased. The smoke being emitted from chimneys of factories contains poisonous gases like carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. These cause various breathing-related problems and later serious diseases.
          </p>
<p>
           The trees look diseased and withered. The drains used to be cleaned. But now, they are seldom cleaned. Mounds of sewage are seen piled up on thoroughfares. Thus the city has become unfit for healthy living. It is all due to increasing environmental pollution. This situation calls for immediate steps that should be taken by all of us to check the increasing environmental pollution. If immediate steps are not taken in this direction, the world may soon become unsuitable for living.
          </p>
<p>
           OR
           <br/>
           B. Technology can be highly addictive, particularly for children, whether it’s cell phones, iPods, tablets, computers, or even a simple television set – they can all engross children and create a strong attachment. Write a paragraph analysing the given statement in about 120 words.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The argument highlights the pervasive nature of technology’s addictive potential, especially concerning children. The various devices like cell phones, iPods, tablets, computers, and television emphasizes the wide range of technological stimuli available to children. The term “engross” suggests a deep and all-encompassing involvement, indicating how children can become absorbed and captivated by these gadgets.
          </p>
<p>
           The concern for creating a strong attachment emphasizes the potential for excessive screen time and the resulting negative impacts on children’s physical and mental well-being, social interactions, and academic performance. It underscores the importance of parental guidance and responsible usage to ensure a balanced approach towards technology, encouraging healthy and developmental activities while mitigating the risks of over-reliance and addiction.

<br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A. Trends in Buying Music
           <br/>
           Importance of music is very well depicted by the new applications for music streaming being introduced every day. The given graph illustrates the trends in music buying habits between 2011 and 2018. The data presents three different methods of buying music: streaming, downloading and buying CDs. Overall, both downloads and physical sales of music have steadily declined. The latter has slumped since 2011, while the downturn for the former began in 2014. However, there has been a sharp rise in people streaming music since 2013.
          </p>
<p>
           In 2011, the majority of music sales were of CDs, at 55% of all sales. In contrast, streaming was not common at all as it was only 5%. Although people had started to download music, it only represented 35% of sales. As sales of CDs began to fall, the era of downloads began. Downloading rose steadily and soon overtook physical sales in mid-2013. During the same period, with newer technology streaming doubled to 10% and started to grow more dramatically. Downloads peaked in 2014 at about 43% of sales but fell to 30% by 2018. This was slightly higher than physical sales, which reduced to 25%. Streaming, on the other hand, overtook both of them and accounted for just over 40% of sales in 2018.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           B. The given pie-chart shows that the Mehta family spends about 50% of the entire income on food and rent. As both these expenditure are for sustenance, they are unavoidable. It may be that they reside in a big city where rent and food are costly. A lot of money is spent on clothing which is comparable to transportation and rent. Transportation accounts for one-fifth of the expenditure of the family. 10% of the entire income is spent on entertainment. The most crucial aspect of the family is that they have very few savings that turn up to be 5% of the income. This would definitely be unsafe for the future. Measures should be taken to cut the unnecessary expenditure and increase the savings. Expenditure on clothing can be reduced so as to increase the savings of the family.

           B. When I returned, there was an appalling spectacle. There was complete silence from the box, but from its air holes and chinks around the lid, blood had trickled and dried. I whipped off the lock and tore open the lid and Mij, exhausted and blood-spattered, whimpered and caught at my leg. He had torn the lining of the box to shreds; when I removed the last of it so that there were no cutting edges left, it was just ten minutes until the time of the flight, and the airport was five miles distant. I put the miserable Mij back into the box, holding down the lid with my hand. I sat in the back of the car with the box beside me as the driver tore through the streets of Basra like a ricocheting bullet. (Mijbil the Otter)

           Answer:
           <br/>
           The poetic device used in the line’And not your yellow hair’ is alliteration as ‘y’ sound is repeated in ‘your’ and ‘yellow’. It makes the text in the extract striking and memorable.

           <br/>
           (i) “The tiger never brushed his teeth”. Why does the author say so?
           <br/>
           (A Baker in Goa-Glimpses in India) (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The author said so because when the baker used to bring bangles for children, they did not even care to brush their teeth or wash their mouths properly. They did not like to take the trouble of plucking the mango leaf for the toothbrush. They did not feel it necessary to wash their mouths just like the tigers who never brush their teeth before meals.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) “The young seagull was alone on his ledge.” How far do you think this condition was by his choice? (His First Flight – Two Stories About Flying) (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The young seagull was alone on his ledge because he was the only one who could not gather the courage to attempt to fly. All his siblings had learnt the art of flying. He was very afraid about attempting to fly as he thought that his wings would not support him.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) What was the effect of observing the sufferings of the world on Buddha?
           <br/>
           (The Sermon at Benaras) (3)
           <br/>
           Refer to the given lines from the text –
           <br/>
           Af about the age of twenty-five, the Prince, heretofore shielded from the sufferings of the world, while out hunting chanced upon a sick man, then an aged man, then a funeral procession, and finally a monk begging for alms.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The sights of suffering sick man, old man, funeral procession and a beggar had a deep impact on Buddha. He was so affected by the sufferings that he at once left his royal life in search of enlightenment and an understanding of the world around him.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) ‘Money is external’. What does the poet mean by this expression in The Ball Poem? (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The poet says that ‘money is external’ to make the boy understand his responsibility and that the loss is immaterial. By the phrase, the poet means that every loss cannot be replaced by money. Money cannot buy the memories associated with a thing and cannot replace the things that we love, for example, the boy’s lost ball.
          </p>
<p>
           (v) How has the poet observed ‘nature’ in the poem ‘Dust of Snow’? (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In the poem ‘Dust of Snow’ the poet observed that nature has healing power. Robert Frost is a nature lover. The crow and the hemlock tree are associated with bad omens or death and fear. But, Frost has presented them very beautifully. They bring cheer to him and are a source of joy. Through his poem, he conveys that everything around us in nature is beautiful.

           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Answer ANY TWO of the following three questions, in about 40 – 50 words each. (2 × 3 = 6)
           <br/>
           (i) Do you think people like Anil and Hari Singh are found only in fiction or are there such people in real life? (A Thief’s Story) (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           People like Anil and Hari Singh are found only in fiction and not in real life. Unlike Anil, most people would have either beaten up the thief or would have handed him to the police. These people are rarely found in today’s world. Anil was a kind and considerate person who was concerned about Hari’s education and future while Hari was a thief whose heart changes after realising the importance of education for his future. In the present world, such people are only found in imaginary stories or novels.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           If Matilda had confessed to her friend that she had lost her necklace, she might have been in much lesser trouble than what she faced after having replaced the necklace. Her friend would have been angry with her and most probably would have asked Matilda to replace it. She would have given her the details from where she bought the necklace and how much it had cost her. Matilda would thus have known that the jewels in the necklace were not real diamonds and this would have saved herself and her husband from all the trouble they went through.

           (iii) Noodle avoids offending Think-Tank but at the same time, he corrects his mistakes. How does he manage to do that? (The Book that Saved the Earth) (3)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Noodle avoids offending Think-Tank while correcting his mistakes by presenting his own thoughts, but referring to them as being of no particular importance. Whenever he had to say something contrary to what Think-Tank said, he would do this. In this way, he would correct Think-Tank’s errors without making Think-Tank feel that he was being corrected.

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Answer ANY ONE of the following two questions, in about 100 – 120 words. (1 × 6 = 6)
           <br/>
           A. ‘From the Diary of Anne Frank’ throws light on the teacher-student relationship, class atmosphere and discipline. Elucidate.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           B. You have been asked to speak on the topic ‘Love for freedom is the natural instinct of every living being’. Prepare the speech draft in not more than 120 words with reference to the poem A Tiger in the Zoo’.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A. ‘ From the Diary of Anne Frank’ clearly describes the teacher-student relationship, class atmosphere and discipline. Anne, who talks a lot in the class, gets punished by Mr. Keesing, her Maths teacher. He gets annoyed with her because of her talkative nature and gave her a punishment. He asked her to write an essay on the subject, ‘A Chatterbox’.
          </p>
<p>
           It was actually a blessing in disguise because he wanted her to focus on studies. He could not be blamed for the punishment as he did it for the development of Anne. Thus, here the teacher-student relationship is very respectful. Such a relationship is about discipline and classroom manners. These are essential for every student as well as a teacher, otherwise both teaching and learning could be hampered.
          </p>
<p>
           This relationship is clearly shown in Mr. Keesing’s and Anne Frank’s actions. They both try to play a joke on each other but in a very humorous and healthy manner. So, this healthy relationship is needed in the classroom for effective teaching and learning.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           B. Good Morning, everyone!
           <br/>
           Today, I would like to share my inputs regarding the topic ‘Love for freedom is the natural instinct of every living being’. As we all know, freedom is liked by each and every living being. No one in this world wants to live as a slave or in captivity. I recently read a poem titled ’A Tiger in the Zoo’.
          </p>
<p>
           In the poem, a tiger has been kept in a cage. He could neither rest nor walk freely while in the cage.
           <br/>
           He ignores visitors as he knows that none of them would help him to be a free being. Although he is angry about being caged, he does not express his anger by roaring and shows his anger quietly. He feels helpless and yearns for freedom. His useful stare at the shining stars in the sky reflects his desire to be free. This poem taught me that it is really bad to keep animals in captivity for the sake of our enjoyment.
           <br/>
           Thank you !
          </p>

           Question 11.
           <br/>
           Answer ANY ONE of the following two questions, in about 100-120 words. (1 × 6 = 6)
           <br/>
           A. Compare and contrast the characters of Noodle and Think-Tank. (The Book That Saved the Earth)
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           B. Horace was a successful thief because he carefully planned his robberies. Should we call him a successful thief and still appreciate his work? Why or why not?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A. Noodle and Think-Tank have contrasting characteristics. Think-Tank likes to be called the ‘Great and the Mighty’. He orders and commands. He is the ruler of Mars, but has no intelligence. He thinks books to be sandwiches. He is wrong about everything. He demands that the crew obey him. He likes to pass on other’s ideas as his own. He is a coward who simply boasts about his power.
          </p>
<p>
           Noodle, his apprentice, is very clever and wise. He corrects the mistakes of Think-Tank very gently.
           <br/>
           He never takes credit for his ideas. But, he offers them to the ruler very gently. Think-Tank makes them his own. When Noodle succeeds Think-Tank and becomes the head of Mars, he becomes friend with Earthlings. While Think-Tank was afraid of Earthlings, Noodle allows Earthlings to set up a library there. So both Noodle and Think-Tank are different from each other.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           B. Yes, Horace is a successful thief as he carefully planned his robberies and completes them well. As a thief, he- had never been caught except for once. Horace’s last robbery at Shotover Grange was very carefully planned. Before carrying out his plans, he had made sure to carefully study the infrastructure of the house for two weeks. He had briefly looked at the electrical wiring, the path and the gardens of the house. Horace cleverly entered the house and made sure to wear gloves so that no fingerprints were left. He had even studied the schedules of the people in the house. All the meticulous planning does make him a successful thief. However, we cannot appreciate his work. The wealth that he had gathered was a result of his robberies. It did not belong to him. By stealing other people’s valuables, he may have become successful but can never stop to be a thief/criminal. He may be efficient but would not be appreciated.
