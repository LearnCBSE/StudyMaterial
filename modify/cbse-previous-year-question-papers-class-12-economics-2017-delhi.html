           Question 7.
           <br/>
           State the meaning and properties of production possibilities frontier. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Production possibilities frontier refers to the frontier which shows the production combination of commodities by available resources and techniques.
           <br/>
           Properties of production posibilities frontier :
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Concave to the origin: PPF is convave to the origin as to increase one additional unit of output, more and more units of another good is sacrificed.
           </li>
<li>
            Downward sloping from left to right: PPF is downward sloping from left to right because more and more units of good are sacrificed to gain one additional unit of another good.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Question 8.
           <br/>
           Show that demand of a commodity is inversely related to its price. Explain with the help of utility analysis. [3]
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Why is an indifference curve negatively sloped? Explain.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Demand refers to the quantity which a consumer is willing to purchase through the given income of the consumer during a specific period of time.The demand of a commodity is inversely related to its price. If the price of a commodity increases, then the demand of it decreases. On the contrary, if the price of a commodity decreases then the demand of it increases.
          </p>
<p>
           This happens because of law of marginal utility. As more and more units of a good are consumed, MU derived from that commodity tends to diminish. As a result, demand of a commodity is inversely related to its price.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Indifference curve refers to the curve showing consumption combinations of two commodities which yield the same level of satisfaction to the consumer.
           <br/>
           An indifference curve is negatively sloped because:
           <br/>
           If the quantity of one good is decreased then the quantity of other good will increase. It means that with the additional consumption of one commodity, a consumer has to sacrifice less and less units of other commodity. This slope of indifference curve is also called Marginal Rate of Substitution of Good X and Good Y, denoted as
           <br/>
           MRS xy = \(\frac{\Delta X}{\Delta Y}\)
          </p>
<p>
           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Explain the conditions of consumer’s equilibrium under indifference curve approach. [4]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Intensity of desire of a commodity, tends to decrease as more and more units of a commodity are consumed. In other words, successive units of consumption offer less satisfaction. It is considered as the law of diminishing marginal rate of substitution.
          </p>
<p>
           In other words, it is a ratio of number of units of goods sacrificed to produce one additional unit of other goods by substituting the resources.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Law of Variable Proportion is enforced during short-run. It states that as more variable factors are used with the fixed factors the marginal product of that factor will decrease. So, a stage will ultimately come when MP of variable factors starts declining.

           Price elasticity of supply refers to the proportionate relationship between the percentage change in quantity supplied and percentage change in price.
           <br/>
           According to Geometric Method, elasticity of supply depends on the origin of supply curve. Therefore, elasticity of supply should have three situations:
           <br/>
           (a) Es = l
           <br/>
           (b) Es &gt; 1
           <br/>
           (c) Es &lt; 1
           <br/>
           (a) Es = 1 ⇒ When a straight line positively sloped supply curve starts from the point of origin.

           Question 11.
           <br/>
           Explain the ‘free entry and exit of firms’ feature of monopolistic competition. [4]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Monopolistic competition is a form of market in which large number of sellers sell different kinds of products. There is a difference in their trade mark, brand name, packaging, etc. The commodities produced by each firm are close substitutes of one another.
          </p>
<p>
           The new firms can enter into a market and the existing firms can leave the market as per their own willingness but sometimes, they face a monopolist restriction i.e., Cartel. There are neither abnormal profits nor any abnormal losses to a firm in the long run. This feature is important as all the firms are able to earn enough profit to continue their production. But entry in monopolistic competition is not so easy and free like perfect competition.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 12.
           <br/>
           When price of a commodity X falls by 10 percent, its demand rises from 150 units to 180 units. Calculate its price elasticity of demand. How much should be the percentage fall in its price so that its demand rises from 150 to 210 units? [6]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Percentage change in Price = (-) 10%
           <br/>
           Q = 150 units

           Ed = x = – 20 %

           Question 14.
           <br/>
           Good Y is a substitute of good X. The price of Y falls. Explain the chain of effects of this change in the market of X. [6]
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Explain the chain of effects of excess supply of a good on its equilibrium price.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Substitute goods refer to goods which can be consumed instead of each other. For example. For example, tea and coffee are substitute goods. If X and Y are susbtitute goods, then a fall in the price of good Y will lead to a fall in the demand of good X. This is because with a fall in the price of good Y, it will become cheaper in comparison to good X, and the demand for good Y will increase and that of good X will fall.
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 Economics 2017 Delhi 8" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-112795" height="259" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Economics-2017-Delhi-8.png" width="301"/>
<br/>
           According to the diagram, DD is the initial demand curve for good X. At price OP, OQ quanitity of good X is demanded. With a fall in the price of good Y, the demand for good X falls. Accordingly, the demand curve for good X shifts parallelly leftwards to D’D’. Here, even at the existing price OP, the quantity demand for good X falls to OQ’.
          </p>
<p>
           Consider DD to be the initial demand curve and SS to be the supply curve of the market. Market equillibrium is achieved at Point E, where the demand and supply cruves intersect each other. Therefore, the equilibrium price is OP, and the equilibrium quantity demanded is OQ
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           . When there is change in other factors than price, there will be rise in the supply of goods. There will be a shift in the supply curve towards the right to S

           with an increase in the supply, and the demand curve DD will remain the same. This implies that there will be a situation of excess supply.

<br/>
           In the above diagram, there is an excess supply of OQ
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>

           Units of output are high at the initial price OP
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           . There by, the producers will tend to reduce the price of the output to increase the sale in the market. Profit margin of the firm will come down and slowly some of the firms will tend to quit the market. Because of this, the market supply will decline to OQ

           level of output and the price of the output also gets reduce to the point OP

           Question 23.
           <br/>
           Explain the basis of classifying taxes into direct and indirect tax. Give examples. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The basis of classifying taxes into direct and indirect tax is whether the burden of the tax is shiftable to others or not. If it is not shiftable, i.e., when liability to pay taxes and the burden falls on the same person, it is a direct tax. And when the burden of a tax is shiftable i.e., liability to pay taxes falls on some person and burden on the other, known as indirect taxes.
          </p>
<p>
           Examples of direct taxes are Income tax, corporate tax whereas, sales tax and service tax are the examples of indirect tax.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Government budget is an annual statement, showing estimation of receipts and expenditure during a fiscal year. Government budget would influence the distribution of income when, Government will spend less to control the level of income in the economy. On the contrary, it will spend more to decrease the level of income in the economy.

           Question 26.
           <br/>
           An economy is in equilibrium. From the following data about an economy, calculate autonomous consumption. [4]
           <br/>
           (a) Income = 5000
           <br/>
           (b) Marginal propensity to save = 0.2
           <br/>
           (c) Investment expenditure = 800
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Given that, Income (y) = 5000
           <br/>
           Marginal Propensity to save (s) = 0.2
           <br/>
           Therefore, marginal propensity to consume
           <br/>
           = 1 – MPS
           <br/>
           = 1 – 0.2 = 0.8
           <br/>
           ∴ Y = C + by + I
           <br/>
           ⇒ 5000 = C + 0.8 × 5000 + 800
           <br/>
           ⇒ 5000 = C + 4000 + 800
           <br/>
           ⇒ 5000 = C + 4800
           <br/>
           ⇒ 5000 – 4800 = C
           <br/>
           ⇒ 200 = C
           <br/>
           ⇒ Autonomous Consumption = 200

           Question 27.
           <br/>
           Why does the demand for foreign currency fall and supply rises when its price rises ? Explain. [6]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Demand for foreign currency, comes from the people who need it to make payment in foreign currency.
           <br/>
           Supply of foreign currency comes from the
           <br/>
           people who receive it due to following reasons :
           <br/>
           (a) Exports of goods and services
           <br/>
           (b) Foreign Investment ‘
           <br/>
           (c) Speculations
           <br/>
           Resons for rise in supply :
           <br/>
           (i) When the price of a foreign currency rises, domestic goods become relatively cheaper. It induces the foreign country to increase their imports from the domestic country. As a result, supply of foreign currency rises. For e.g., if price of U.S dollar rises from ₹ 45 to ₹ 50, then exports to USA will increase as Indian goods will become cheaper. It will raise the supply of U.S. dollars.
           <br/>
           (ii) When price of a foreign currency rises, supply of foreign currency rises as people want to make gains from speculative activities.

           How will you treat the following while estimating domestic product of a country ? Give reasons for your answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Profits earned by branches of country’s bank in other countries
           <br/>
           (b) Gifts given by an employer to his employees on independence day
           <br/>
           (c) Purchase of goods by foreign tourists
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Many activities in an economy are not evaluated in monetary terms, for e.g., Non¬market transactions like services of house wife, kitchen gardening, etc. are not included in GDP due to non-availability of data. It is difficult to ascertain their market value as they are not rendered for the purpose of earning income. Though these services are rendered for the development of a child and welfare of the family, it is not incl uded in the gross natinal product. Thus, non-monetary exchanges is a limitation of using gross domestic product as an index of welfare of a country.
           <br/>
           OR

           (70 -120) – 60 – 700 + 50
           <br/>
           = 9000 + 600 + (-50) – 60 – 650
           <br/>
           = 9600 – 50 – 710
           <br/>
           = 9600 – 760

           Question 30.
           <br/>
           Assuming that increase in invesment is ₹ 1000 crore and marginal propensity to consume is 0.9. Explain the working of multiplier. [6]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Given that Value of MPC = 0.9
           <br/>
           Initial increase in investment = ₹ 1000 crore
           <br/>
           So, every increase of ₹ 1 in the income, 0.9 part of the increased income will be consumed by people.
           <br/>
           Consumption = ₹ 0.90
           <br/>
           Saving = ₹ 0.10
           <br/>
           It is given that initial increase in investment of ₹ 1000 will lead to change in the income by ₹ 1000 in the first round. As MPC is 0.9 so people will consume 0.9 of the increased income i.e., ₹ 900 there by saving ₹ 100. In the next round due to increase in the consumption expenditure by ₹ 900 there will be an increase in income by ₹ 900. Then people will again spend the increased income i.e., ₹ 810 and save the rest part of the income ₹ 90. similarly, this process will continue and the income will go on increasing as a result of the increase in consumption. The total change in the income is ₹ 10,000 and the change in the investment will be ₹ 1,000.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           What to produce refers to the most important central problem. There are two types of commodities which a consumer has to produce:
           <br/>
           (1) War – Time commodities
           <br/>
           (2) Peace – Time commodities

           Question 9.
           <br/>
           A consumer consumes only two goods : Explain the conditions of consumer’s equilibrium using utility analysis. [4]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A consumer gets equilibrium while consuming two commodities at the point where marginal utility of two commodities is equal to each other.
           <br/>
           Let the two goods be X and Y. The equilibrium conditions are:
           <br/>
           (1) \(\frac{\mathrm{MU}_{\mathrm{x}}}{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{x}}}=\frac{\mathrm{MU}_{\mathrm{y}}}{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{y}}}\)
           <br/>
           (2) MU of a good falls as more of it is consumed.
           <br/>
           Explanation of consumer’s equilibrium using utility analysis :
           <br/>
           (1) Suppose \(\frac{\mathrm{MU}_{\mathrm{x}}}{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{X}}}&gt;\frac{\mathrm{MU}_{\mathrm{y}}}{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Y}}}\). It makes per rupee MU
           <sub>
            x
           </sub>
           mbre tharf per rupee MU
           <sub>
            y
           </sub>
           . This induces the consumer to buy more of X and less of Y. As a result MU
           <sub>
            X
           </sub>
           starts falling and MUy starts rising. The process continues till
           <br/>
           \(\frac{\mathrm{MU}_{\mathrm{x}}}{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{x}}}&gt;\frac{\mathrm{MU}_{\mathrm{y}}}{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{y}}}\) again
           <br/>
           (2) Unless the MU of a good falls as more of it is consumed, the consumer will never reach equilibrium again, as \(\frac{\mathrm{MU}_{\mathrm{x}}}{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{x}}}\) equal to \(\frac{\mathrm{MU}_{\mathrm{y}}}{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{y}}}\)

           Answer:
           <br/>
           If X and Y are complementary goods, then a fall in the price of good Y will lead to a rise in the demand of good X. Graphically, the effect of this change can be seen as follows :

           Question 26.
           <br/>
           An economy is in equilibrium. From the following data about an economy calculate investment expenditure:
           <br/>
           (i) Income = 10000
           <br/>
           (ii) Marginal propensity to consume = 0.9
           <br/>
           (iii) Autonomous consumption = 100
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           C = \(\overline{c}\) + by
           <br/>
           = 100 + 0.9 × 10000 C
           <br/>
           ⇒ ₹ 9,100
           <br/>
           Investment = Y – C
           <br/>
           ⇒ 10,000 – 9,100
           <br/>
           ⇒ ₹ 900
          </p>
<p>
           Question 27.
           <br/>
           Assuming that increase in investment is ₹ 800 crore and marginal propensity to consume is 0. 8, explain the working of multiplier. [6]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The working of multiplier can be explained as follows: We are given that the value of MPC = 0.8 and also that initial increase in investment is ₹ 800 crore. This implies that with every increase of ₹ 1 in the income, people consume 0.8 part of the increased income i.e, people consume ₹ 0.80 and save ₹ 0.20
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 Economics 2017 Delhi 16" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-112803" height="271" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Economics-2017-Delhi-16.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Economics-2017-Delhi-16.png 403w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Economics-2017-Delhi-16-300x202.png 300w" width="403"/>
<br/>
           The table shows that initial increase in investment of ₹ 800 will lead to a change in income by ₹ 800 in the first round. As MPC is 0.8, so people will consume 0.8 of the increased income (i.e. ₹ 640), thereby saving ₹ 160. This will be termed as leakage (as it is not ploughed back into the economy).
          </p>
<p>
           In the next round, due to the increase in the consumption expenditure by ₹ 640, there will be an increase in income ₹ 640. The people will again spend the increased income i.e. ₹ 512 and save the rest part of the income ₹ 128.
          </p>
<p>
           In the third round, similarly the increased consumption expenditure of ₹ 512 will cause a change in the income by ₹ 512. They will spend a part of this income on consumption i.e., ₹ 409.6 and will save the rest of the increased income ₹ 102.4.
          </p>
<p>
           This process will continue and the income will go on increasing as a result of increase in consumption. The total change (ΔY) = ₹ 4000 (approx) and the change in the investment (ΔI) will be 800.
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 Economics 2017 Delhi 17" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-112805" height="239" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Economics-2017-Delhi-17.png" width="257"/>
<br/>
           Thus, we can observe that an initial increase in the investment by ₹ 800 crore results in increase of income and output by ₹ 4000 crore.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) National Income = (v) +(vi) + (vii) – (iv) – (viii) – (iii) – (i)
           <br/>
           = 5000 + 3000 + 1000 – 200 – 150 – 800 – (- 50)
           <br/>
           = 9000 – 200-950 + 50
           <br/>
           = 9000 – 200 – 900
           <br/>
           = 9000 – 1100
           <br/>
           = ₹ 7900 Crores .
