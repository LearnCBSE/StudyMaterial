            Question 1. How does the sound produced by a vibrating object in a medium reach your ear?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Air is the commonest material through which sound propagates. When vibrating objects, like prongs of a tuning fork move forward, they push the molecules of the air in front of them. This in turn compresses the air, thus creating a region of high pressure and high density called compression. This compression in the air travels forward. When the prongs of the tuning fork move backward, they create a region of low pressure in the air, commonly called rarefaction.
           <br/>
           This region has low pressure, low density, and more volume. As the tuning fork continues to vibrate, the regions of compression in the air alternate with the regions of rarefaction. These regions alternate at the same place. The energy of vibrating tuning fork travels outward. This energy which reaches the ears, makes the eardrums to vibrate and thus we hear sound

            Question 1. Explain how sound is produced by your school bell.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Air is the commonest material through which sound propagates. When school bell is rung, it pushes the molecules of the air in front of it. This in turn compresses the air, thus creating a region of high pressure and high density called compression. This compression in the air travels forward. When the bell moves back, it creates a region of low pressure in the air, commonly called rarefaction. This region has low pressure, low density, and more volume. As the bell continues to vibrate, the regions Of compression in the air alternate with the regions of rarefaction. These regions alternate at the same place. The energy of vibrating bell travels outward. This energy which reaches the ears, makes the eardrums to vibrate and thus we hear sound.

            Question 2. Why are sound waves called mechanical waves ?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Some mechanical energy is required to make an object vibrate. Sound energy cannot be produced on its own. The mechanical energy Of vibrating object travels through a medium and finally reaches the ear. Therefore, the sound waves are called mechanical waves.

            Question 3. Suppose you and your friend are on the moon. Will you be able to hear any-sound produced by your friend ?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           No, I will not be able to hear sound, because moon has no atmosphere. Therefore, no sound waves can travel to your ears and, therefore, no sound is heard.

            Question 1. Which wave property determines (a) loudness, (b) Pitch ?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           (a) The amplitude of the wave determines the loudness; more the amplitude of a wave, more is the loudness produced.
           <br/>
           (b) The pitch is determined by the frequency of the wave. Higher the frequency of a wave more is its pitch and shriller is the sound.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            Question 2. Guess which sound has a higher pitch; guitar or car horn ?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Car horn has a higher pitch than a guitar, because sound produced by the former is shriller than the latter.

            Question 1. What are wavelength, frequency, time period and amplitude of a sound wave ?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Frequency: The number of compressions or rarefactions taken together passing through a point in one second is called frequency.
           <br/>
           Time Period: It is the time taken by two consecutive compressions or rarefactions to cross a point.
           <br/>
           Amplitude: It is the magnitude of maximum displacement of a vibrating particle about its mean position.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            Question 2. How are the wavelength and frequency of a sound wave related to its speed ?

<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">

<strong>
            Question 3. Calculate the wavelength of a sound wave whose frequency is 220 Hz and speed is 440 m s
            <sup>
             -1
            </sup>
            in a given medium.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Frequency = 220 Hz
           <br/>
           Speed of sound = 440 m s
           <sup>
            -1
           </sup>
<br/>
           We know speed of sound Frequency x Wavelength = 220 x Wavelength
           <br/>
           Wavelength = \(\frac { V }{ \vartheta } \) = \(\frac { 440 }{ 220 } \) = 2m
          </p>
<p>

<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           The loudness depends on energy per unit area of the wave and on the response of the ear but intensity depends only on the energy per unit area of the wave and is independent of the response of the ear.

           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Sound is mechanical energy which produces a sensation of hearing. When an Object is set into vibrations, sound is produced.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            Question 3. Cite an experiment to show that sound needs a material medium for its propagation.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Take an electric circuit which consists of a cell, a switch and an electric bell arranged inside a bell jar, which stands on the platform of an evacuating pump. The switch of the bell is pressed to close the electric circuit. When there is air within the bell jar, sound is heard. Air is now pumped out of the bell jar. When the air is completely removed from the bell jar, no sound is heard as it is obvious from fig. because the medium of air which has to carry energy from the bell to the bell jar is removed. It shows that sound needs material medium for its propagation.

           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Speed of sound is 330 m/sec in air medium at 0°C. Whereas speed of light is 3 x 10
           <sup>
            8
           </sup>
           m/sec. When we compare the speed of light with that of speed of sound, speed of light is greater than that of speed of sound. Therefore thunder is heard a few seconds after the flash is seen.

            Question 10. Does sound follow the same laws of reflection as light does? Explain.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Yes. Sound follows the same laws of reflection as that of light because,
           <br/>
           (i) Angle of incidence of sound is always equal to that of angle of reflection of sound waves.
           <br/>
           (ii) The direction in which sound is incident, the direction in which it is reflected and normal all lie in the same plane.

           The persistence of sound in an auditorium is the result of repeated reflections of sound and is called reverberation.
           <br/>
           To reduce the undesirable effects due to reverberation, roofs and walls of the auditorium are generally covered with sound absorbent materials like compressed fiberboard, rough plaster or draperies. The seat materials are also selected having sound absorption properties.

<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           The loudness of sound is determined by its amplitude. The amplitude of the sound wave depends upon the force with which an object is made to vibrate. Loud sound can travel a larger distance as it is associated with higher energy. A sound waves spreads out from its source. As it moves away from the source its amplitude as well as its loudness decreases.

            Answer:
           </strong>
           Ultrasound is used to clean parts located in hard-to-reach places (i.e.) spiral tube, odd shaped parts, electronic components etc. Objects to be cleaned are placed in a cleaning solution and ultrasonic waves are sent into the solution. Due to the high frequency, the dust particles, grease get detached and drop out. The objects thus get thoroughly cleaned.

            Answer:
           </strong>
           Working: SONAR Consists of a transmitter and a detector and is installed in a boat or a ship as shown in the fig. The transmitter produces and transmits ultrasonic waves. These waves travel through water and after striking the object on the seabed, get reflected back and are sensed by the detector. The detector converts the ultrasonic waves into electrical signals which are appropriately interpreted. The distance of the object that reflected the sound wave can be calculated by knowing the speed of sound in water and the time interval between the transmission and reception of the ultrasound.

            Question.21. Explain how defects in a metal block can be detected using ultrasound.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Ultrasounds can be used to detect cracks and flaws in metal blocks. Metallic components are used in the construction of big structures like buildings, bridges, machines and scientific equipment’s. The cracks or holes inside the metal blocks, which are invisible from outside reduces the strength of the structure. Ultrasonic waves are allowed to pass through the metallic block and detectors are used to detect the transmitted waves. If there is even a small defect, the ultrasound gets reflected back indicating the presence of the flaw or defect.

            Question 22. Explain how the human ear works.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           The outer ear is called “pinna. It collects the sound from the surroundings. The collected sound passes through the auditory canal. At the end of the auditory canal there is a thin membrane called the eardrum or the tympanic membrane. When a compression of the medium reaches the eardrum the pressure on the outside of the membrane increases and forces the eardrum inward. Similarly, the eardrum moves outward when a rarefaction reaches it. In this way the eardrum vibrates. The vibrations are amplified several times by three bones (the hammer, anvil and stirrup) in the middle ear. The middle ear transmits the amplified pressure variations received from the sound wave to the inner ear. In the inner ear, the pressure variations are turned into electrical signals by the cochlea. These electrical signals are sent to the brain via the auditory nerve and the brain interprets them as sound.

<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           The matter or substance through which sound is transmitted is called a medium. It can be solid, liquid or gas. Example, air, water, metals.

            Answer:
           </strong>
           A wave is a disturbance that moves through a medium when the particles of the medium set neighbouring particles into motion. The particles of the medium do not move forward but the disturbance is carried forward.

            Answer:
           </strong>
           When an object just attains a supersonic speed, it causes shock waves in air. As a result there is large change in air pressure. This results in sonic boom.
          </p>

            Answer:
           </strong>
           Sound is a form of energy. As it moves away from the source its amplitude as well as its loudness decreases. The energy also get transformed in vibration of the particles of the medium.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            Question 5. Why do we say that sound waves are longitudinal?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Longitudinal waves need medium for propagation. The sound energy travel in the same line as the particles oscillate.
           <br/>
           ———— &gt; Sound energy
           <br/>
           &lt;————&gt;Particles oscillation

            Answer:
           </strong>
           Sound is a mechanical wave and needs a material medium to propagate. It cannot travel in vacuum and can be shown by the following experiment.
           <br/>
           • Take an electric bell and an airtight glass bell jar. The electric bell is suspended inside the airtight bell jar. Switch ‘ON’ the electric bell.
           <br/>
           • Now, connect the bell jar to vacuum pump.
           <br/>
           • Pump out the air from the jar, the sound becomes fainter, although the same current passes through the bell.
           <br/>
           • Pump out some more air from the jar, a very feeble sound is heard.
           <br/>
           • When the air is completely removed from the jar, no sound is heard.

           (a) Outer Ear: Pinna, auditory canal and tympanic membrane.
           <br/>
           Pinna: It collects the sound from the surroundings.
           <br/>
           Auditory Canal: The sound waves collected passes through this canal.
           <br/>
           Tympanic Membrane: It is a thin membrane which receives the vibrations of sound. A compression reaches the eardrum, the pressure on the outside of the membrane increases and pushes the eardrum inward, and moves out when the rarefaction reaches.
           <br/>
           (b) Middle Ear: Consists of three small bones called hammer, anvil and stirrup. The vibrations are received by these three bones and the strength of vibrations is increased i.e., the sound is amplified and passed to inner ear.
           <br/>
           (c) Inner Ear: It consist of cochlea and auditory nerve.
           <br/>
           Chochlea receives the amplified vibrations and convert them into electrical signals. These electrical signals are sent to the brain via the auditory nerve and the brain interprets the signals as sound.

            Question 3. • Take a slinky. Ask your friend to hold one end. You hold the other end. Now stretch the slinky and give it a sharp push towards your friend.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            • What do you notice? If you move your hand pushing and pulling the slinky alternatively, what will you observe?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            • If you mark a dot on the slinky, you’ll observe that the dot on the slinky will move back and forth parallel to the direction of propagation of the disturbance.

            Answer:
           </strong>
           When we give a small jerk a hump is produced and this travels forward. When we give a sharp push continuous disturbance is produced. When we give a push or pull to the slinky, slinky starts moving in the forward and backward direction parallel to the direction of propagation of the disturbance.

            • Lift the pipes on the right .vertically to a small height and observe what happens.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           (i) Reflection of sound is similar to reflection of light i.e. Angle of incidence = Angle of reflection.
           <br/>
           (ii) If we lift the pipe vertically to a small height, well not be able to hear the sound through the other end of the pipe because Angle of incidence * Angle of reflection. Therefore the reflected ray will not travel through the pipe B.
