           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow: [12]
           <br/>
           THE ART OF LIVING
          </p>
<p>
           1. The art of living is learnt easily by those who are positive and optimistic. From humble and simple people to great leaders in history, science or literature, we can learn a lot about the art of living, by having a peep into their lives. The daily routines of these great men not only reveal their different, may be unique life styles but also help us learn certain habits and practices they followed. Here are some; read, enjoy and follow in their footsteps as it suits you.
          </p>
<p>
           2. A private workplace always helps. Jane Austen asked that a certain squeaky hinge should never be oiled so that she always had a warning whenever someone was approaching the room where she wrote. Willliam Faulkner, lacking a lock on his study door, detached the doorknob and brought it into the room with him. Mark Twain’s family knew better than to breach his study door they would blow a horn to draw him out. Graham Green went even further, renting a secret office; only his wife knew the address and the telephone number. After all, everyone of us needs a workplace where we can work on our creation uninterruptedly. Equally we need our private space too!
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           3. A daily walk has always been a source of inspiration. For many artists, a regular stroll was essentially a creative inspiration. Charles Dickens famously took three hour walks every afternoon, and what he observed on them fed directly into his writing. Tchaikovsky made do with a two-hour jaunt but wouldn’t return a moment early; convinced that doing so would make him ill. Ludwig van Beethoven took lengthy strolls after lunch, carrying a pencil and paper with him in case inspiration struck. Nineteenth century composer Erik Satie did the same on his long hikes from Paris to the working- class suburb where he lived, stopping under street lamps to jot down ideas that came on his journey; it’s rumoured that when those lamps were turned off during the war years, his music declined too. Many great people had a limited social life too. One of Simone de Beauvior’s close friends puts it this way. “There were no receptions, parties. It was an uncluttered kind of life, a simplicity deliberately constructed so that she could do her work.” To Pablo the idea of Sunday was an “at home day”.
          </p>
<p>
           4. The routines of these thinkers are difficult. Perhaps it is because they are so unattainable. The very idea that you can organize your time as you like is out of reach for most of us, so I’ll close with a toast to all those who worked with difficulties. Like Francine Prose, who began writing when the school bus picked up her children and stopped when it brought them back; or T.S. Eliot, who found it much easier to write once he had a day job in a bank than .he had as a starving poet and even F. Scott Fitzgerald, whose early books were written in his strict schedule as a young military officer. Those days were not as interesting as the nights in Paris that came later, but they were much more productive and no doubt easier on his liver.
          </p>
<p>
           5. Being forced to follow someone else’s routine may irritate, but it makes it easier to stay on the path. Whenever we break that trail ourselves or take an easy path of least resistance, perhaps what’s most important is that we keep walking.
          </p>

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Read the passage below: [8]
           <br/>
           The Great Wall of China was built to link existing fortifications into a united defense system and better keep invading Mongol tribes out of China. It is the largest man-made monument ever to have been built and it is said that it is the only one visible from space. Many thousands of people must have given their lives to build this huge construction. The Great Wall of China is a series of towers made of stone, brick, earth, wood and other materials, generally built along an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of the various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were being built as early as the 7th century BCE; these, later joined together and made bigger and stronger, are now collectively referred to as the Great Wall. Especially famous is the wall built (220-206 BCE) by Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China. Little of that wall remains. Since then, the Great Wall has on and off been rebuilt,
          </p>
<p>
           maintained and enhanced; the majority of the existing wall is from the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).
           <br/>
           Other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and emigration. Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of watch towers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor.
          </p>
<p>
           The Great Wall stretches from Dandong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, along an arc that roughly delineates the southern edge of Inner Mongolia. A comprehensive archaeological survey, using advanced technologies, has concluded that the Ming walls measure 8,850 km. This is made up of 6,259 km sections of actual wall, 359 km of trenches and 2,232 km of natural defensive barriers such as hills and rivers. Another archaeological survey found that the entire wall with all of its branches measures out to be 21,196 km. King Zheng of Qin conquered the last of his opponents and unified China as the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty (“Qin Shi Huang”) in 221 BCE.
          </p>
<p>
           Intending to impose centralized rule and prevent the resurgence of feudal lords, he ordered the destruction of some sections of the walls, however, he ordered building of new walls to connect the remaining fortifications along the empire’s northern frontier. Transporting the large quantity of materials required for construction was difficult, so builders always tried to use local resources. Stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges, while earth was used for construction in the plains.
           <br/>
           The Great Wall concept was revived under the Ming dynasty in the 14th century, to gain a clear upper hand over the Mongolian tribes.

           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Write a debate either for or against the motion: [10]
           <br/>
           Hardwork, not Intelligence paves the way to success in life. (150-200 words)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           “Hardwork beats intelligence when intelligence does not work hard”. This saying is replete with fact. The idea is not to undermine the importance of intelligence but to emphasize that there is no substitute for hard work. Good Morning everyone! 1 …., have come before you all in favour of the motion: ‘Hard work, not Intelligence paves the way to success in life’.
           <br/>
           Though it cannot be denied that an intelligent person possesses a natural ability to do something well, but intelligence alone does not ascertain success, unless it is accompanied by hard work. The ability of an intelligent person has to be combined with hard work. Hard work embellishes one’s personality, polishes one’s talents and unlocks a person’s potentials so as to pave the way to achieve success in life.
          </p>
<p>
           Working hard is so important that it can, to a great extent, compensate for lack of intelligence but there is no alternative to hard work. Strong determination, confidence and a desire to reach your goals should always be . cherished but this aspiration can only be fulfilled by working laboriously. Many a time intelligent people do not work hard enough, they become contented and feel complacent in their own sense of superiority. They overlook the fact that it is only hard work that enables us to utilise our knowledge and intelligence in the most conducive way. Hard work brings in perseverance and resoluteness that enables you to set targets and guides you like a teacher so that you do not derail from your track.
           <br/>
           I would like to conclude by saying not all of us can be intelligent, but we all can achieve a lot by putting in that extra effort which will surely pave the way for success in life. Thank you
           <br/>

           You are RarryTRajani. Write a speech in 150-200 words on ‘Importance of Morning Walk’.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The only thing one may at times not like about a morning walk is the fact that one has to get up early in the morning from a sound sleep. Other than that, the importance and advantages of morning walk are manifold. Good Morning everyone! I, Rajani, have come before you all to speak on the topic, ‘Importance of Morning Walk’.
           <br/>
           The morning atmosphere is fresh and pleasant, there is less pollution in the air and the lovely sights and sounds of nature soothes one’s mind and body. Regular morning walk keeps one fit. It helps control blood pressure, lessens stress and gives us the energy to work with zeal. It is a light exercise that is suitable for people of all ages. Young men and women, old people as well as children, all can benefit from a morning walk which soothes our entire being.
          </p>
<p>
           A brisk walk in the morning activates our body’s systems, normalises our pulse rate and improves our blood circulation. When we begin our day with a walk, we rid ourselves from lethargy and experience a high level of energy that has a positive effect on our physical and mental well-being. Morning walk actually creates a positive momentum that stays with us throughout the day. The best thing about a morning walk is that it is a simple workout regime that most people think they can stick to life long.
           <br/>
           To conclude, I would like to say that since we all share the need to stay healthy, walking is a great way to spend quality time in the company of family and friends doing something that is beneficial to everyone.

           Question 6.
           <br/>
           Choice of course after clearing Senior School Examination produces a great deal of stress on the minds of our students. Counselling can be of great help to them. Write an article in 150-200 words on the topic, ‘Role of counselling in choice of course’. You are Ram/Rajani. [10]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           ROLE OF COUNSELLING IN CHOICE OF COURSE
           <br/>
           By: Ram
           <br/>
           Every student faces the question of ‘What Next?’ after clearing his Senior School Examination. During this phase most students face a great deal of stress and at this time counselling regarding the choice of course can prove to be of valuable help to them. Many students face a dilemma while choosing a course because the only career guidance they have is the opinion of their parents, the teacher’s judgement and their friends’ comments. These factors are certainly not sufficient for a child to base the foundation of his entire life and career. Professional counselling involves scientifically developed aptitude and personality tests that enable the counsellor to give the best suited advice to students to choose the course that best suits their ability.
          </p>
<p>
           Human capabilities are numerous and cannot be measured but every person has some unique traits. Based on their strengths, one of the keys that helps to identify these qualities is through the medium of counselling. Counselling sessions help the students to understand the pros and cons of the different streams and the career paths they offer, so students can make an informed choice and get a correct course assessment that enables them to avoid risk of career path change later in their life.
           <br/>
           Counselling thus provides the essential morale-boost to students by building their level of motivation that is very essential for long-term success and improves their overall performance.

           THE GRANDEUR OF REPUBLIC DAY CELEBRATIONS
           <br/>
           By: Ram, N.C.C cadet
           <br/>
           Shyamala Public School, Salem
           <br/>
           Being an N.C.C cadet I got the privilege of attending the Republic Day Parade in Delhi. I was awe-struck by its sheer grandeur and magnificence. The parade showcases not only India’s defence capability but also gives us a unique glimpse of our cultural and social heritage. The Republic Day Parade which is held in the capital city, New Delhi starts from the Rashtrapati Bhavan, along Rajpath, past India Gate. Before its commencement, the Prime Minister lays a floral wreath at the ‘Amar Jawan Jyoti, a memorial to the soldiers who laid down their lives during various wars. The President then unfurls the National flag after which the different regiments of our armed forces march past with their bands in all their fineries saluting their commander-in-chief, the President of India.
          </p>
<p>
           Another highlight of the parade were the tableaus of different states that depicted India’s culture and diversity. Each Indian state and Union Territory is represented by a float that presents an aspect of its culture and is a visual treat. Watching the Republic Day celebrations was the most enjoyable experience and it was my good fortune to have got this opportunity to watch the parade from such close quarfers, an experience that I will not be able to forget. The celebrations came to an end and everyone arose for the National Anthem following which the important dignitaries left Rajpath.

           <br/>
           Seeing me sitting at my desk tearing up newspapers day in and day out, most people thought I was doing next to nothing. It is likely that the Boss thought likewise too. So anyone who felt I should be given some occupation would barge into my cubicle and deliver an extended lecture.
           <br/>
           (a) What did the author do at his desk?
           <br/>

           (f) Why is Shakespeare wicked for the slum children?
           <br/>
           (g) Why did Gaftdhiji agree to the planters’ offer of a 25% refund to the farmers?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) In honour of his last French lesson in the school, M.Hamel had put on his fine Sunday clothes. He had on his green coat, his frilled shirt and the little black, all embroidered silk cap that he never wore except on inspection and prize days.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) William Douglas had a deep fear of water. Douglas had to resort to professional assistance to overcome his fear of water. He employed an instructor to teach him how to swim. He practiced five days a week, an hour each day with the instructor and piece by piece the instructor built a swimmer out of Douglas.
          </p>
<p>
           (c) The winter season is a traditional symbol of death and the moon, especially, if it is pale, it enhances the image of decay. The mother’s pale and colourless face that has becomes rather wrinkled due to old age gives her a look that the poet compares with ‘the late winter’s moon’.
          </p>
<p>
           (d) Everybody made fun of Roger Skunk because he gave out a bad smell. He was upset about this so he met the old owl who advised him to go to the wizard, who would help him and give him a good smell.
          </p>
<p>
           (e) Mukesh’s attitude towards life was different from that of Saheb. Unlike Saheb he was optimistic about his future and so he dared to dream. He wanted to become a motor mechanic and also wanted to learn to drive a car. Saheb lacked determination so he harboured no dreams or ambitions about his future.
          </p>
<p>
           (f) Shakespeare is described as wicked because there is no correlation between Shakespeare’s works and the life of the slum children. Shakespeare’s works are no good to the children in slum schools as they cannot identify themselves with the characters. He talks about a world far removed from reality. The slum children can never reach the level of education to understand the works of shakespeare.
          </p>
<p>
           (g) Gandhiji had asked the indigo planters for a 50 per cent refund to the farmers but they offered only 25 per cent. Gandhiji still agreed to their offer because for him the amount of the refund was of less importance. More important was the fact that the planters had been forced to surrender part of their rights. So he agreed to their settlement.

           <br/>
           Leadership is all about a strong concern for others. What light does Champaran episode throw on Gandhiji’s leadership?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           There is no doubt about the fact that a good leader is one who has a strong concern for others:. Not only does he have a mass appeal but he even rises from the masses. He is a man of principles and his life is an open book. Gandhiji’s sincere efforts to get justice for the Champaran sharecroppers and his conscientious endeavours to uplift the people there are proof enough of the true leadership qualities that he possessed. His primary concern was the welfare of the common man because Gandhiji never contented himself with large political or economic solutions. Seeing the cultural and social backwardness in the Champaran village he wanted to do something about it immediately. His politics was always intertwined with the practical day-to-day problems of the millions and through his selfless actions he displayed what true leadership was all about.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The good people we meet sometimes leave an impression on us. Compassion and understanding can transform a person and bring out his essential human goodness. As is the case with the rattrap peddler whose meeting with the crofter and Edla bring about a positive transformation in his nature. The lonely old crofter was extremely kind to the peddler. Despite his hospitality the peddler stole his money and committed a breach of trust. Edla too treated him nicely, even after she came to know his true identity. The peddler who had always considered the world to be a rattrap that enclosed upon people finally felt released from this rattrap due to the kind, generous and sympathetic treatment of the crofter and Edla. He leaves behind a letter of thanks for Edla with a Christmas gift and the money he had stolen from the crofter, to be restored to its rightful owner.

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Answer the following questions in 120-150 words: [6]
           <br/>
           Attempt a character sketch of the Governor in the story, ‘Evans Tries an O-LeveT. What was the only flaw in his handling of Evans?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Governor of HM Prison, Oxford, despite being an extra cautious man, is actually quite gullible and he, quite unfortunately, over-estimates himself. His judgement of people is rather poor. Due to his average intelligence he is not able to comprehend and understand Evan’s shrewdness. He ignores vital matters that require his personal attention. Searching McLeery and escorting the wounded McLeery needed his personal supervision but he neglected these. He became rather casual at the critical times and fails to grasp the complexity of the situation. However, he does reveal a mark of intelligence when he locates the hotel where Evans is hiding on the basis of the correction slip. But then again he ignores the vital issues and finally is unable to capture Evans.
          </p>
<p>
           The only flaw in his handling of Evans was that the Governor gets a little over-confident when he tells himself that Evans had no chance of escaping. He over-estimates himself and his intelligence and underestimates Evans’ shrewdness and cleverness.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           How did Dr. Sadao face the dilemma he came across in his life? What light does it throw on his character?
           <br/>
           Ans. An American prisoner of war got washed away to Japanese doctor, Sadao’s doorstep. Being a doctor, Sadao gave top priority to saving the life of a dying man despite the ongoing war between America and Japan and the fact that all Americans were considered to be their enemies. Being a doctor, Sadao’s duty was to save a dying man but saving an enemy would be an act of treachery. But the doctor not only saved him from dying but did not even hand him over to the police. He rose above narrow prejudices of race and country and helped the young soldier to escape. Dr. Sadao’s basic human values gave him the ability to rise above petty prejudices. His essential love for humanity and his sincerity towards his duty transcend all other narrow considerations. As a doctor it was his duty to save a dying man so he put aside all other options and respected the ethics of his profession.
          </p>
<p>
           Dr. Sadao is a dutiful doctor and when it comes to commitment towards his profession even his obligation towards his country becomes secondary to him. He brings back to life a man who is on the verge of death without caring about the fact that the person whose life he is saving is a soldier of the enemy camp. It is Dr. Sadao’s conscience and professional ethics that supercede his patriotism and so he saves the American soldier. He rises, above narrow prejudices as he realises his job as a doctor is to save a life and not to take it away. Even after he told the General everything about the American soldier he felt restless for three consecutive nights at the thought that he was actually waiting for someone to be killed. Finally, he decided to help the soldier to escape so that he could be at peace with himself and put his body and his mind to rest.

           <br/>
           Write a debate either for or against the motion: [10]
           <br/>
           “Courses in Humanities provide a better scope in career than Sciences’, (150-200 words)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Which is a better course to opt for after the Xth standard? A decade or so earlier 1 would have answered this question saying Science stream was the best option but now I would say that if one has a better aptitude for Humanities, then he should go for it without thinking. Good Morning everyone! I have come before you all to speak in favour of the motion: ‘Courses in Humanities provide a better scope in career than Sciences’.
           <br/>
           In the present scenario, with the advent of globalization the scope for humanities has altered. Fast growing markets, mushrooming media houses and a plethora of career options that could be both academic or vocational, has brought the humanities stream, which was once considered as a secondary discipline to the front. The rising professions of marketing, media, entertainment and administration have opened avenues for students of this discipline. … ’
          </p>
<p>
           The demand created by market economy has raised the prominence of subjects like economics, literature, fine arts, law, communication, english etc. The under graduate and post graduate programmes in humanities are neither narrow in scope nor limited in opportunities. Rather they now offer a wide and expensive scope for research and higher studies in a range of subjects. The dogmas in our society regarding students opting for the humanities stream is now a thing of the past.
           <br/>
           To conclude, I would like to say that now professionals from this field are commanding great respect and receiving high salaries in the job market, and competing with their science and technology counterparts on the entrepreneurship front.

Include the importance of laughing and smiling, the need to bring in harmless humour in life and the important role it plays in relieving stress, using interesting anecdotes. Ans. The proverb, ‘Laughter is the best medicine’, is as old as it is true. It is important to laugh and smile and bring in harmless humour in our daily life as it plays an important role in relieving stress. Good Morning all! I Rajani, President of Humour Club in Chennai, have come to address you on ‘Laughter, the Best Medicine’.
          </p>
<p>
           When we laugh, a positivity brightens us and we are able to spread this positive feeling to others. Just by having a good laugh we can relax both our body and our mind. Even in the most difficult of times a laugh or even a smile can make you feel better as it disintegrates feelings that make one upset. It helps one to unwind and energize himself. You can get rid of the tensions and stress that clutter your mind with a good laugh that infuses fresh energy and enthusiasm.
           <br/>
           As Charles Dickens said, “There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humour.” But unfortunately in today’s busy and hectic life people have forgotten hotv to laugh and enjoy small jokes.
           <br/>
           This could be one of the major reasons why there is an unprecedented rise in the number of people who suffer from depression. Charlie Chaplin very rightly said, “A day without laughter is a day wasted”.
           <br/>
           I would like to conclude by saying, “You don’t stop laughing because you grow older, you grow older because you stop laughing.”

           WOMEN MUST BE GIVEN HONOUR
           <br/>
           By: Ram, Social Activist
           <br/>
           Women constitute almost half of the world’s population and are equal stakeholders of society. But unfortunately, even now, in the 21st century, violence against women is rampant and their unnecessary harassment continues despite the hue and cry of there being more laws to ensure their protection.
           <br/>
           It is a bitter reality that, every year, thousands of women become victims of violence in their homes and are harassed on the roads and sometimes these incidents devastate their lives for ever. These unfortunate incidents affect the physical as well as mental health of the victim. It is very important to take up concrete efforts and introduce stern laws to ensure how violence and harassment against women can be avoided and how they can get their due honour in society.
          </p>
<p>
           We cannot just hold our legal system and the police responsible for the atrocities committed to women. As good citizens, we have a fundamental duty to contribute towards bringing an order to ensure dignity and respect for women so that they too can live with a sense of freedom, pride and confidence. To ensure this is the collective work of our society. We have to develop basic morality and nurture a value system that teaches respect for women especially among young boys and men.
          </p>
<p>
           A reform in the police system is also needed wherein women police should be deployed in most areas so as to make women feel safe. CCTV cameras should be installed at strategic places and these should be closely monitored.
           <br/>
           Our legal system also needs reforms wherein stringent punishments that are non-bailable in nature should be given to a person who outrages the modesty of a woman. We also need fast track courts to deal with offences and crimes against women.
           <br/>
           The need of the hour is to take action not by force but by will to make our country safe and secure for women and bring in reforms whereby women feel more fearless and empowered.

           IMPORTANCE OF NEWSPAPERS IN OUR LIFE
           <br/>
           By: Rajani
           <br/>
           Newspapers are the oldest and most reliable source of news and information. The electronic media is at times unreliable, gives inadequate information and is not always available. Newspapers are not only most easily available but they are also the cheapest. Moreover newspapers are very important for students for a good exposure to English language and enhancement of their vocabulary through the “Editorial Column”. Newspapers are written with honesty and sincerity unlike the electronic media which sensationalizes news to increase TRPs and sometimes misleads public.
          </p>
<p>
           Though news conveyed by TV news channels is quicker and faster, these, many a times, tend to omit facts and details about an incident and sometimes even sensationalise news without a reason. Here the newspaper comes in handy as it gives not only vital details but also contains more reliable news. Besides, the newspaper is easy to carry and can be read at any time. Further, the permanence of the printed word helps in refreshing one’s memory about certain facts and incidents reported in the past. Newspapers also contain many columns dedicated to advertisements like vacant situations, buying or selling of goods, information about missing persons, obituary news, etc. All this and much more information is contained only in the newspaper. Newspapers have been and will remain the mouthpiece of the nation and the unseen advisers of the common people.

           <br/>
           (g) When did Bama first come to know of the social discrimination faced by the people of her community?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) M. Hamel’s regret on the last day of the French lesson was that they all had put off learning their language till the next day and now most of them who claimed to be Frenchmen could neither speak nor write their language. For this they all, including M. Hamel himself, had a great deal to reproach themselves with.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) William Douglas developed an aversion to water when he was three or four years old. He stood at a beach with his father when a wave swept over him and knocked him down. He was buried under water and became breathless. He was petrified and developed a permanent fear for water.
          </p>
<p>
           (c) The poet’s childhood fear was that she would lose her mother to the cruel hands of death and would thus be separated from her forever. So she feared this separation from her mother.
          </p>

           (g) Bama was in the third standard and she used to walk from her school to her home. One day she saw an elderly man carrying a small packet that contained some eatables. He held the packet by its strings without touching it and extended it to the landlord who opened it and began to eat. She thought it was something funny but Annan, her elder brother, told her the man was not being funny and he was in fact from a low caste and so couldn’t touch the food packet.

           BANNING OF LIQUOR SHOPS
           <br/>
           By: Rajani
           <br/>
           Many states have taken up the welcome move of banning liquor shops. These states include Gujarat, Bihar, Nagaland and Manipur and the Union Territory of Lakshadweep. This move is most positive and will help to promote the physical and mental well-being of society in general.
           <br/>
           Binge drinking and continued alcohol consumption cause many health problems. Moreover, it decreases productivity of an individual, increases family problems and is also one of the major causes of broken relationships. People who drink heavily are most likely to develop a physical and emotional dependency on alcohol. With so many negative effects associated with its consumption there is no reason why one should not appreciate the government’s move of banning liquor shops.
          </p>
<p>
           It is also a matter of appreciation that the governments are ready to forego the large amount of revenue that they gain by selling liquor, only because it impacts negatively on society. The Government of these states have imposed complete ban for a social cause to create an alcohol free environment. Through this ban the. governments hope to improve the society’s standard of living. When alcohol is not available and there is no way it can be bought the money one wastes on it is saved and can be utilised productively elsewhere. So there is no doubt about the fact that this bold and welcome move taken by the governments should be appreciated and applauded.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           You are Ram/Rajani. Write an article in 150-200 words, on the topic, ‘Rapid increase in the number of private cars and its effect on Environment’.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           THE PROBLEM OF POLLUTION
           <br/>
           By: Ram/Rajani
           <br/>
           Cities, in general, have a great deal in common with vehicles. In fact they often seem to be turning into vehicles. India’s population and its traffic is concentrated within its cities. The increasing number of vehicles in Delhi is putting our city at the risk of completely losing clean air to breathe. Delhi would have, in fact, been buried under a pollution load if the Supreme Court had not intervened to introduce cleaner fuels and emissions technology in the city, in the form of CNG-run public vehicles. Moreover, increase in the number of vehicles also means getting stuck in rush traffic hour which has also become a routine. It is high time we now look towards solving this problem of heavy traffic congestion which is taking a toll both on our health and our time.
          </p>
<p>
           Traffic police department must use technology for controlling and monitoring the movement of vehicles at important and busy cross roads for which the department officials can also take the help of Close Circuit T.V. Drives should be launched to educate the masses about the importance of driving in their respective lanes only and to follow traffic signals strictly. Violation of these should result in fines and in case of repeated offence the driving license of the person should be confiscated. Pollution check of vehicles by owners at regular intervals should be made mandatory. This can also contribute a lot in saving the environment from pollution. Thus, we as responsible citizens just need to make a start.
          </p>
<p>
           Most of us who have walked along the congested commercial areas of our cities will certainly agree that private cars are indeed a nuisance that further add to the congestion of traffic and create unnecessary chaos.
           <br/>
           Good morning everyone, I …, have come before you all to speak in favour of the motion ‘Private cars should be banned in the congested commercial areas of the cities.’ Private cars can never improve the quality of life in big cities, especially in the congested commercial areas. They are noisy and dangerous to street users. People have to waste their valuable time and fuel in heavy traffic jams. Since we now have plenty of alternatives like highly improvised public transport which include private cabs, buses and the metro train services, it has become rather convenient to commute from one place to another within the city.
          </p>
<p>
           More cars also means higher levels of pollution in our already polluted cities. Reducing the number of cars on the city, roads can help the government to save a huge amount of petrol. Moreover driving city roads is nothing but relentless misery for car owners and I am sure they too would prefer tension-free and easy options to travel.
           <br/>
           To conclude, I would like to say banning certain things can sometimes help us to lead stress-free lives which will certainly do us good in the long run.
           <br/>
           Thank You!

           Question 8.
           <br/>
           Answer any five of the following questions in 30-40 words each: [5 × 2 = 10]
           <br/>
           (a) How different was the scene in the classroom on the day of the last lesson?
           <br/>
           (b) What happened to Douglas at the YMCA pool?
           <br/>
           (c) What did Kamala Das think when she looked at her mother?
           <br/>
           (d) Describe the pun on the word ‘arms’? (Keeping Quiet)
           <br/>
           (e) Why does Jo want Wizard to hit Mommy?
           <br/>
           (f) Who was Derry? What problems did he have?
           <br/>
           (g) What was his German teacher’s opinion of Evan’s proficiency in German?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The usual hustle and bustle of the morning hours could not be seen on the day of the last lesson. It was all very still and quiet as it used to be on a Sunday morning. The din of opening and closing of desks and the rapping of the teacher’s ruler on the table could not be heard. The students had already taken their places and even the village elders had gathered there.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) As Douglas was sitting on the side of the YMCA pool waiting for others, a boy who was around eighteen years old came there and yelled, ‘Hi, Skinny! How’d you like to be ducked?” saying this, he picked up Douglas and tossed him into the deep end of the pool.
          </p>
<p>
           (c) Kamala Das saw her mother dozing open-mouthed, her face looking pale and colourless like that of a corpse. She then realized how old her mother was. She looked quite haggard and worn-out as the ravages of time had taken their toll on her.
          </p>
<p>
           (d) The word ‘arms’ has a dual meaning. It refers to our own which are engaged in several harmful and destruction activities. ‘Arms’ also refers to the weapons that are used during war to cause widespread destruction.
          </p>
<p>
           (e) Jo wanted the wizard to hit the umbrella on the head of ‘stupid’ mommy because she felt Roger’s mother had not done the right thing by forcing the Wizard to make him smell bad again and so she should be punished.
          </p>
<p>
           (f) Derry is a complex-ridden fourteen year old boy. He is a victim of inferiority complex after acid accidentally spilled and burnt one side of his face. His handicap has filled him with bitterness and so Derry suffers more on account of the pain that his own views of how everyone hates him, causes him.
          </p>
<p>
           (g) Evan’s German teacher had a very low opinion of his (Evans’) proficiency in German. Evans could not even understand basic pleasantries in German. He was very sure that Evans did not have ‘a cat in a hell’s chance’ of getting through the O-level German examination.
