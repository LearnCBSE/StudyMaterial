           Class 11 Political Science Chapter 8 NCERT Textbook Questions Solved
          </h3>
<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Which of the following do you feel are compatible with the idea of secularism? Give reasons.
           <br/>
           (a) Absence of domination of one religious group by another.
           <br/>
           (b) Recognition of a state religion.
           <br/>
           (c) Equal state support to all religions.
           <br/>
           (d) Mandatory prayers in schools.
           <br/>
           (e) Allowing separate educational institutions for any minority community.
           <br/>
           (f) Appointment of temple management bodies by the government.
           <br/>
           (g) Intervention of state to ensrure entry of Dalits in temples.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) This idea is compatible because:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Due to equality, majority of religious people will not dominate minority religious people.
           </li>
<li>
            Minority religious people also enjoy freedom to practicise any belief, way of worship and to preach as well.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           (b) It is not compatible because such situation prevails only in religious dominated state.
          </p>
<p>
           (c) Equal support to all religions by state cannot be provided because:
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<ul>
<li>
            One state can have 10 festivals to be celebrated where as the other may have only 2 or 4.
           </li>
<li>
            The ways of worship are also different which is not possible for state to follow different methods.
           </li>
<li>
            Hence, it should be left on religious community or individual’s will.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           (d) It is not compatible because students, teacher and employees are free to adopt their own way to offer prayer.
          </p>
<p>
           (e) It is compatible to provide protection and security to people of minority religions group.
          </p>
<p>
           (f) It is not compatible to be the direct involvement of state and or government in religious affairs.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           (g) It is compatible because:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            The weaker sections will not be denied the freedom to adopt any religion on ground of being lower caste.
           </li>
<li>
            Secularism does not challenge only inter-religious intra-religions domination also.
           </li>
<li>
            State’s efforts promote freedom within religions as well as equality among them.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>

           Question 3.
           <br/>
           What do you understand by secularism? Can it be equated with religious tolerance?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Secularism is:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            State has no religion of its own.
           </li>
<li>
            No, discrimination among the people on the basis of religion.
           </li>
<li>
            Every citizen is equal before law.
           </li>
<li>
            Every citizen enjoys freedom to reside with freedom and dignity in any part of country.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Equating of secularism with religious tolerance:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Religious tolerance is a powerful base of secularism, i.e. state has positive attitude due to sense of religious tolerance but they do not treat all seats equally.
           </li>
<li>
            Secularism provide fundamental rights to minority religious groups within the dominion of state.
           </li>
<li>
            The religious tolerance is not a right but a mutual sympathy.
           </li>
<li>
            Secularism opposes to intra-religious domination because, if religious tolerance is allowed only, then the people of majority seat will dominate the people of minority seat.
           </li>
<li>
            Indian secularism emphasises on peaceful co-existence refer to equal respect towards all religions and their practices and clarity in case of ambiguity.
           </li>
<li>
            Under Indian secularism, religiously sanctioned caste-hierachy are not acceptable.
           </li>
<li>
            Though secular state does not have to treat every aspect of every religion with equal respect, but it stops disregard towards the genuine aspects of other seats or religion.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>

           Question 6.
           <br/>
           Explain the concept of principled distance.
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            To be secular, a state must not only refuse to be theocratic but also have no formal legal alliance with any religion because separation of religion-state is necessary but not a sufficient ingredient of a secular state.
           </li>
<li>
            A secular state must be committed to principles and goals to be derived from non-religions sources including peace, religious freedom, freedom from discrimination and inter-religious and intra-religious equality.
           </li>
<li>
            Secular states are neither theocratic nor establish a religion. Separation of religion and state is a mutual exclusion not to interfere in the affairs of religion and as well religion will not interfere in the affairs of state.
           </li>
<li>
            No policy of the state can have an exclusively religious rationale because state and religion both exercise separate spheres of their own.
           </li>
<li>
            The state cannot aid any religious institution or provide any financial support to religious communities as well as it cannot hinder the activities of religious communities which are within the broad limits set by law of land.
           </li>
<li>
            Religion is a private matter and it is not a matter of state policy or law, i.e. if a religious community excommunicates its dissenters, the state can only be a silent witness.
           </li>

          </p>
<p>
           Let us look at a very different kind of secularism practised in Turkey in the first half of the twentieth century. This secularism was not about principled distance from organised religion, instead it involved, active intervention in and suppression of, religion. This version of secularism was propounded and practised by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.
          </p>
<p>
           He came to power after the First World War. He was determined to put an end to the institution of Khalifa in the public life of Turkey. Ataturk was convinced that only a clear break with traditional thinking and expressions could elevate Turkey from the sorry state it was in. He set out in an aggressive manner to modernise and secularise Turkey. Ataturk changed his own name from Mustafa Kemal Pasha to Kemal Ataturk (Ataturk translates as Father of the Turks). The Fez, a traditional cap worn by Muslims, was banned by the Hat Law. Western clothing was encouraged for men and women. The Western (Gregorian) calendar replaced the traditional Turkish calendar. In 1928, the new Turkish alphabet (in a modified Latin form) was adopted.
          </p>
<p>
           Can you imagine a secularism that does not give you the freedom to keep the name you are identified with, wear the dress you are used to, change the language you communicate in? In what ways do you think Ataturk’s secularism is different from Indian secularism?

          </p>
<p>
           ‘Equal protection by the State to all religions’. This is how Nehru responded when a student asked him to spell out what secularism meant in independent India. He wanted a secular state to be one that “protects all religions, but does not favour one at the expense of others and does not itself adopt any religion as the state religion”. Nehru was the philosopher of Indian secularism. Nehru did not practise any religion, nor did he believe in God. But for him secularism did not mean hostility to religion. In that sense Nehru was very different from Ataturk in Turkey. At the same time Nehru was not in favour of a complete separation between religion and state. A secular state can interfere in matters of religion to bring about social reform. Nehru himself played a key role in enacting laws abolishing caste discrimination, dowry and sati, and extending legal rights and social freedom to Indian women. While Nehru was prepared to be flexible on many counts, there was one thing on which he was always firm and uncompromising. Secularism for him meant a complete opposition to communalism of all kinds. Nehru was particularly severe in his criticism of the communalism of the majority community, which posed a threat to national unity. Secularism for him was not only a matter of principles, it was also the only guarantee of the unity and integrity of India.
