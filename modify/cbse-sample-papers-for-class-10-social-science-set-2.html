           Income of 3rd family = ₹ 14,000
           <br/>
           Let the income of 4th family be x
           <br/>
           \(Average Income =\frac{₹ 6000+8000+14000+x}{4}\)
           <br/>
           \(₹ 10,000=\frac{₹ 28,000+x}{4}\)
           <br/>
           ₹ 40,000 = ₹ 28,000 + x

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Democracy accommodates social diversities:
           <br/>
           (i) Democracies develop a procedure to conduct their competition. This reduces the possibility of social tensions becoming explosive or violent.
           <br/>
           (ii) No society can fully and permanently resolve conflicts among different groups. But we can certainly learn to respect these differences and can evolve a mechanism to negotiate these differences.
           <br/>
           (iii) The ability to handle social differences, divisions, and conflicts is thus a definite plus point of democratic regimes.
           <br/>
           (iv) Example: Belgium has successfully negotiated differences among its ethnic population. This reduces the possibility of tensions
           <br/>

           Answer:
           <br/>
           Road transport in India is not competitive but it provides complementary to railways in the following ways
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Door-to-Door Service Road transportation increases the reach of railways by providing the finar links from the railhead to the final destination, i.e. giving door-to-door service.
           </li>
<li>
            Loading and Unloading Anywhere Railways can stop only at specific destinatïons where loading and unloading facilities are available, but vehicles on the road can be loaded or unloaded virtually anywhere.
           </li>
<li>
            Speed of Transportation Bulky and non-perishable goods are transported by railways over long distances and take a longer time, whereas perishable goods can be transported through road transport in a shorter time.

           Question 34.
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow: [4]
           <br/>
           The use of money spans a very large part of our everyday life. Look around you and you would easily be able to identify several transactions involving money in any single day. Can you make a list of these? In many of these transactions, goods are being bought and sold with the use of money. In some of these transactions, services are being exchanged with money. For some, there might not be any actual transfer of money taking place now but a promise to pay money later.
          </p>
<p>
           Have you ever wondered why transactions are made in money? The reason is simple. A person holding money can easily exchange it for any commodity or service that he or she might want. Thus everyone prefers to receive payments in money and then exchange the money for things that they want. Take the case of a shoe manufacturer. He wants to sell shoes in the market and buy wheat. The shoe manufacturer will first exchange shoes that he has produced for money, and then exchange the money for wheat. Imagine how much more difficult it would be if the shoe manufacturer had to directly exchange shoes for wheat without the use of money. He would have to look for a wheat growing farmer who not only wants to sell wheat but also wants to buy the shoes in exchange. That is, both parties have to agree to sell and buy each others commodities. This is known as double coincidence of wants. What a person desires to sell is exactly what the other wishes to buy. In a barter system where goods are directly exchanged without the use of money, double coincidence of wants is an essential feature.
          </p>
<p>
           In contrast, in an economy where money is in use, money by providing the crucial intermediate step eliminates the need for double coincidence of wants. It is no longer necessary for the shoe manufacturer to look for a farmer who will buy his shoes and at the same time sell him wheat. All he has to do is find a buyer for his shoes. Once he has exchanged his shoes for money, he can purchase wheat or any other commodity in the market. Since money acts as an intermediate in the exchange process, it is called a medium of exchange.
          </p>
<p>
           34.1 Give reason why transactions are made in money ? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The reason why transactions are made in money is very simple. A person holding money can easily exchange it for any commodity
           <br/>
           or service that he or she might want. Thus everyone prefers to receive payments in money and then exchange the money for things they want.
          </p>
<p>
           34.2 What do you mean by double coincidence of wants ? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When the seller and buyer or both parties agree to sell and buy each others commodities, it is called double coincidence of wants. What a person desires to sell is exactly what the other wishes to buy. In a barter system where goods are directly exchanged without the of money, double coincidence of wants is an essential feature.
          </p>
<p>
           34.3 How would the shoe manufacturer had directly exchanged shoes for wheat without the use of money ? [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           If the shoe manufacturer had to directly exchange shoes for without the use of money, he would have to look for a wheat growing farmer who not only wants to sell wheat but also wants to buy the shoes in exchange. That is both parties have to agree to sell and buy each others commodities.

           crops. This has great ecological consequences like salinisation of the soil. At the same time, it has transformed the social
           <br/>
           landscape i.e., increasing the social gap between the richer landowners and the landless pool As we can see, the dams did
           <br/>
           create conflicts between people wanting different uses and benefits from the same water resources.
          </p>
<p>
           In Gujarat, the Sabarmati-basin farmers were agitated and almost caused a riot over the higher priority given to water supply in
           <br/>
           urban areas, particularly during droughts. Interstate water disputes are also becoming common about sharing the Costs and benefits of the multi-purpose project.
          </p>
<p>
           Do you know that the Krishna-Godavari dispute is due to the objections raised by Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh governments? It is regarding the diversion of more water at Kovna by the Maharashtra government for a multi-purpose project. This would reduce downstream flow If their states with adverse consequences for agriculture and industry.
          </p>
<p>
           Most of the objections to the projects arose due to their filure to achieve the purposes for which they were built. Ironically, the
           <br/>
           dams that were constructed to control floods have triggered floods due to sedimentation in the reservoir. Moreover;the big dams have mostly been unsuccessful in controlling floods at the time of excessive rainfall.
          </p>
<p>
           You may have seen or read how the release of water from dams during heavy rains aggravated the flood situation in Maharashtra and Gujarat in 2006. The floods have not only devastated life and property but also caused extensive soil erosion. Sedimentation also meant that the flood plains were deprived of silt, a natural fertiliser, further adding on to the problem of land degradation. It was also observed that the multi-purpose projects induced earthquakes, caused water-borne diseases and pests and pollution resulting from excessive use of water.
          </p>
<p>
           (i) Do you agree that farmers are responsible for the salinisation of soil? If yes, why? (1)
           <br/>
           (ii) is it true that darns create conflict between people? State any one real life example. (2)
           <br/>
           (iii) Is it true that multi-purpose projects are not able to achieve their major objectives? If yes, how? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Yes, I agree that farmers are also responsible for salinization of soil. It is because they switched to water-intensive commercial crops which need more irrigation and cause salinisation of soil.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) It is true that dams create conflicts between people. As from the same water resources, different people ‘want different uses and benefits.
          </p>
<p>
           For example, the Krishna-Godavari dispute is due to the objections raised by Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh governments. It is regarding the diversion of more water of Koyna by the Maharashtra government for a multi-purpose project. This reduces downstream flow in their states with adverse consequences for agriculture and industry.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) It is true that multi-purpose projects fail to achieve the aim for which they were built. The dams were constructed to control floods but have triggered floods due to sedimentation in the reservoir. Moreover, the big dams have mostly been unsuccessful in controlling floods at the time of excessive rainfall.

           Question 36.
           <br/>
           Read the extract given below and answer the questions that follow: [4]
           <br/>
           Following the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, European governments were driven by a spirit of conservatism. Conservatives believed that established traditional institutions of state and society – like the monarchy, the Church, social hierarchies, property, and the family – should be preserved. Most conservatives, however, did not propose a return to the society of pre-revolutionary days.
          </p>
<p>
           Rather, they realized, from the changes initiated by Napoleon, that modernization could strengthen traditional institutions like the monarchy. It could make the state’s power more effective and stronger. A modern army, an efficient bureaucracy, a dynamic economy, and the abolition of feudalism and serfdom could strengthen the autocratic monarchies of Europe. In 1815, representatives of the European powers who had collectively defeated Napoleon, met at Vienna to draw up a settlement for Europe. The Congress was hosted by the Austrian Chancellor Duke Metternich.
          </p>
<p>
           The delegates drew up the Treaty of Vienna of 1815 with the object of undoing most of the changes that had come about in Europe during the Napoleonic wars. The Bourbon dynasty, which had been deposed during the French Revolution, was restored to power, and France lost the territories it had annexed under Napoleon. A series of states were set up on the boundaries of France to prevent French expansion in the future.
          </p>
<p>
           36.1 What was the purpose behind convening the Congress of Vienna in 1815? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The purpose behind conveying the Congress of Vienna in 1815 was to restore the conservative regime in Europe.
          </p>
<p>
           36.2 What did conservatives focus on at the Congress of Vienna? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The main intention was to restore the monarchies that had been overthrown by Napoleon.
          </p>
<p>
           36.3 How did the Congress of Vienna ensure peace in Europe? [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Congress of Vienna ensured peace in Europe by laying out a balance of power between all the great powers in Europe.
