           Class 11 Sociology Chapter 4 NCERT Textbook Questions Solved
          </h3>
<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Why is the Enlightenment important for the development of sociology?
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            During the late 17th and 18th centuries, Western Europe saw the emergence of radically new ways of thinking about the world. It is referred to ‘The Enlightenment’.
           </li>
<li>
            The ability to think rationally and critically transformed the individual human being into both the producer and the user of all knowledge, the ‘knowing subject’.
           </li>
<li>
            Only persons who could think and reason could be considered as a complete human being.
           </li>
<li>
            To become the definite features of the human world, it was necessary to displace nature, religion and the divine acts of gods from the central position they had in earlier days of understanding the world.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           How was the Industrial Revolution responsible for giving rise to sociology?
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Production moved out of houses and went over to factories. People left their rural areas and went over to urban areas to find jobs in newly established industries
           </li>
<li>
            Rich people started to live in large mansions and labour class started to live in slums.
           </li>
<li>
            Due to modern administrative system, monarchy was forced to take the responsibility of public subjects and public welfare.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           What are the various components of a mode of production?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A mode of production has the following components:
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<ul>
<li>
            First is the means of production which means the labour class who produces.
           </li>
<li>
            Second is the capitalist class who owns the means of production.
           </li>
<li>
            Labour is sold in the market like commodity.
           </li>
<li>
            The capitalist class has wealth and means to get his production done by the labourers.
           </li>
<li>
            The capitalist class becomes richer at the cost of labourers.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Why do classes come into conflict, according to Marx?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Karl Marx has studied two classes. Two opposite groups exist in each society.
           <br/>
           First who does exploitation and second is that who is being exploited.
           <br/>
           Conflict is always going on between these two classes from the very beginning.
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Bourgeoisie owns all the means of production and it suppresses other groups with his means of production.
           </li>
<li>
            Second class is the labour class which was given the name of Proletariats.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Conflict is always going on between the exploiters and the exploited because capitalist hardly wants to give anything to labourer.
           <br/>
           According to Marx, economic processes generally tend to generate class conflicts though this also depends on political and social conditions.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           What are social facts? Flow do we recognise them?
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<ul>
<li>
            Social facts are collective representations which emerge from the association of people.
           </li>
<li>
            They are not particular to a person but of a general nature, independent of the individual.
           </li>
<li>
            Durkheim called the ’emergent level’, that is the level of complex collective life where social phenomena can emerge.
           </li>
<li>
            One of Durkheim’s most significant achievements is his demonstration that sociology, a discipline that dealt with abstract entities like social facts/could nevertheless be a science founded on observable empirically verifiable evidence.
           </li>
<li>
            The most famous example of his use of new kind of empirical data is in his study of suicide.
           </li>
<li>
            Each individual case of suicide was specific to the individual and his/her circumstances.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Question 6.
           <br/>
           What is the difference between ‘mechanic’ and ‘organic’ solidarity?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Durkheim says that in every society some values, ideas, beliefs, ways of behaviour, institutions and laws are there which binds the society in a single knot. Because of the presence of these elements, the relations and unity or solidarity exist in society.
           <br/>
           He classified a society by the nature of social solidarity which existed in the society which are as follows:
          </p>
<p>
           Mechanical Solidarity
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            It is predominant in less advanced societies.
           </li>
<li>
            It is segmental in nature.
           </li>
<li>
            In this social bonds are relatively weak.
           </li>
<li>
            It exists more where population is less.
           </li>
<li>
            In it, collective authority is absolute.
           </li>
<li>
            It is highly religious.
           </li>
<li>
            It is concrete and specific.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Organic Solidarity
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<ul>
<li>
            It is predominant in more advanced societies.
           </li>
<li>
            It is organized in nature.
           </li>
<li>
            In this, the social bonds are strong.
           </li>
<li>
            It exists where population is more.
           </li>
<li>
            In this, there is more room for individual initiative.
           </li>
<li>
            It is highly secular.
           </li>
<li>
            It is abstract and general.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Question 7.
           <br/>
           Show, with examples, how moral codes are indicators of social solidarity.
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            The social solidarity was to be found in the codes of conduct imposed on individuals by collective agreement.
           </li>
<li>
            Moral facts are phenomena like others; they consist of rules of action recognizable by certain distinctive characteristics, it must then be possible to observe them, describe them, classify them and look for certain laws explaining them.
           </li>
<li>
            Society, for Durkheim, was a social fact which existed as a moral community over and above the individual.
           </li>
<li>
            Social solidarities exerted pressure on individuals to conform to the norms and expectations of the group.
           </li>
<li>
            Moral codes are manifestations of particular social conditions.
           </li>
<li>
            The moral code that is appropriate for one society is inappropriate for another.
           </li>
<li>
            The prevailing social conditions could be deduced from the moral codes. This has made sociology akin to the natural sciences and is in keeping with his larger objective of establishing sociology as a rigorous scientific discipline.
           </li>
<li>
            By observing behaviour patterns it is possible to identify the norms, codes and social solidarities which governed them.
           </li>
<li>
            The existence of otherwise ‘invisible’ things like ideas, norms, values and so on could be empirically verified by studying the patterns of social behaviour of the people.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Question 8.
           <br/>
           Discuss Durkheim’s concept of collective conscience.
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            The concept of collective conscience is defined by Emile Durkheim as ‘the body of beliefs and sentiments common to the average of members of the society. It contains those beliefs and sentiments which are found in the average members of society, e.g., it is people’s belief that poor should not be tortured, instead people should take care of them.
           </li>
<li>
            It comprised a form and content which varies according to whether society is characterised by mechanical or organic solidarity.
           </li>
<li>
            According to mechanical solidarity the collective conscience is extensive and strong widely related to people’s life. It controls the people through various religious or other traditional means of sanction.
           </li>
<li>
            It emphasies the primacy of society over the individual and his or her dignity.
           </li>
<li>
            Gradually the collective conscience declined in its influence and became less extensive.
           </li>
<li>
            In the transition to organic solidarity this could be observed in the replacement of repressive by restitutive i.e., making amends of it by systems of law.
           </li>
<li>
            According to Durkheim, a society wide collective conscience can only hold a segmental society together.
           </li>
<li>
            The collective conscience becomes a diffuse, abstract cult of the individual which as a civil religion, supplies ultimate principles and justifications but cannot bear the whole weight of social cohesion.
           </li>
<li>
            Durkheim believes that collective conscience is in the beliefs and expresses itself in the form of symbols, e.g., the festival of Vijayadashmi represents the victory of good over evil. This belief can be seen in the concrete form in this festival.
           </li>

           <br/>
           Try to find out what Marx and Weber wrote about India.
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Marx argued that people’s ideas and beliefs originated from the economic system of which they were part.
           </li>
<li>
            Marx laid great emphasis on economic structure and processes because he believed that they formed the foundation of every social system throughout human history.
           </li>
<li>
            Marx believed that class struggle was the major driving force of change in society.
           </li>
<li>
            Weber argued that the overall objective of the social sciences was to develop an ‘interpretative understanding of social action’.
           </li>
<li>
            The central concern of the social sciences was with social action and since human actions necessarily involved subjective meanings, the methods of enquiry of social science also had to be different from the methods of natural science.
           </li>
<li>
            The social world was founded on subjective human meanings, values, feelings, prejudices, ideals and so on.
           </li>
<li>
            Social scientists had to constantly practise ’empathetic understanding’. But this investigation has to be done objectively.
           </li>
<li>
            Sociologists are meant to describe, not judge, the subjective feelings of others.
