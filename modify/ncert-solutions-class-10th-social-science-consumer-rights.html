            Question 1:
           </strong>
           Why are rules and regulations required in the marketplace? Illustrate with a few examples.
           <br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
            <br/>
</strong>
<strong>
            Rules and regulations are required in the market place due to the following reasons :
           </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
            The consumers are exploited by the shopkeepers and traders in different ways such as less weight or measurement, more price, adulterated and defective goods.
           </li>
<li>
            In case of a complaint regarding a good or service, the shopkeeper or trader tries to avoid any responsibility. The seller tries to shift all the responsibility onto the buyer as if the seller has no responsibility once a sale is completed.
           </li>
<li>
            Sometimes producers are few and powerful while the consumers purchase in small amounts and are scattered. Big companies with huge wealth manipulate the market in many ways.
           </li>
<li>
            At times false information is passed on through the media, and other sources to attract consumers. For example, a company for years sold powder milk for babies all over the world as the most scientific product claiming this to be better than mother’s milk. It took years of struggle before the company was forced to accept that it had been making false claims. Similarly a long battle was fought with the cigarette manufacturing companies to accept that their product could cause cancer.  Hence there is a need for rules and regulations to ensure protection for consumers.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
            Question 2:
           </strong>
           What factors gave birth to the consumer movement in India? Trace its evolution?
           <br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
            <br/>
</strong>
           The factors that gave birth to the consumer movement in India are manifold. It started as a “social force” with the need to protect and promote consumer interests against unfair and unethical trade practices. Extreme food shortages, hoarding, black marketing and adulteration of food led to the consumer movement becoming an organised arena in the 1960s. Till the 1970s, consumer organisations were mostly busy writing articles and holding exhibitions.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           More recently, there has been an upsurge in the number of consumer groups who have shown concern towards ration shop malpractices and overcrowding of public transport vehicles. In 1986, the Indian government enacted the Consumer Protection Act, also known as COPRA. This was a major step in the consumer movement in India.

<strong>
            Question 3:
           </strong>
           Explain the need for consumer consciousness by giving two examples.
           <br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
            <br/>
</strong>
           Two examples are Reji’s suffering and Amritha’s waiting. In case of Reji, a hospital, due to negligence of the doctors and staff in giving anaesthesia, crippled him for life. In case of Amritha, an engineering graduate, after attending an interview for job, did not receive any news of the result. In both the cases, they were conscious of their rights. Reji’s father filed a complaint in the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission claiming compensation of ? 5 lakh for medical negligence and deficiency in service.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           The State Commission dismissed his case but he appealed again in the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi. The National Commission in its decision held hospital responsible for medical negligence and directed to pay the compensation. In case of Amritha, she filed an application under RTI Act to know the result. She soon got her call letter for appointment. Thus, there is a need for consumer consciousness to protect their interests successfully.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            Question 4:
           </strong>
           Mention a few factors which cause the exploitation of consumers.
           <br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
           Exploitation of consumers is caused by a variety of factors. Producers are always looking for easy ways to increase profits. Adulterated or low-quality goods have fewer production costs, and if the consumer is unaware or illiterate, it is easy to cheat him/her. Also, shopkeepers brush off their responsibility by claiming that the manufacturer is to blame. Consumers feel helpless in this situation. Often, when the consumers are known not to check the retail price of a commodity on its packing, sellers add extra charges to the same. In places where there is no awareness of consumer rights and the COPRA, consumer exploitation is rampant.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            Question 5:
           </strong>
           What is the rationale behind the enactment of Consumer Protection Act 1986?
           <br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
            <br/>
</strong>
           The rationale behind the enactment of Consumer Protection Act 1986 (COPRA) was to protect the interests of the consumers because there are no legal formalities for filing the complaint. A consumer need not employ a lawyer or professional for legal assistance. He himself can plead the case in a consumer court. A person can make a complaint to consumer court on a plain paper along with supporting documents such as guarantee or warrantee card, cash memo etc.

<strong>
            Question 6:
           </strong>
           Describe some of your duties as consumers if you visit a shopping complex in your locality.
           <br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
            <br/>
</strong>
           Some of my duties as a consumer if I visit a shopping complex include checking expiry dates of the products I wish to purchase, paying only the maximum retail price printed on the goods, preventing shopkeepers from duping me with defective products, and registering a complaint with a consumer forum or court in case a seller refuses to take responsibility for an adulterated or flawed product.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            Question 7:
           </strong>
           Suppose you buy a bottle of honey and a biscuit packet. Which logo or mark you will have to look for and why?
           <br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
            <br/>
</strong>
           While buying a bottle of honey or a biscuit packet, the logo or mark one will have to look for is ISI or Agmark. These are logos certifying the quality of goods in the market. Only those producers are allowed to use these marks who follow certain quality standards set by the organisations issuing these certifications. Thus, if a bottle of honey or a biscuit packet has one of these logos on it, then it implies that the product is of good quality.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            Question 8:
           </strong>
           What legal measures were taken by the government to empower the consumers in India?
           <br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
            <br/>
</strong>
<strong>
            The following legal measures were taken by the government to strengthen the consumers in India :
           </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
            Consumer Protection Act popularly known as COPRA was enacted in 1986. It was amended in 1991 and 1993.
           </li>
<li>
            In October 2005, Right to Information Act was enacted. This enables citizens to have all the information about the functions of government departments. The citizens have the right to know the particulars of goods and services they purchase.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
            Question 9:
           </strong>
           Mention some of the rights of consumers and write a few sentences on each?
           <br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
            <br/>
</strong>
           Some of the rights of consumers include the right to be informed, the right to choose, the right to seek redressal and the right to representation in consumer courts. Under the RTI Act of 2005, consumers can now even get information regarding the working of government departments. The right to choose allows a consumer to choose if he wishes to continue or discontinue the use of a service he purchased. The right to seek redressal permits a consumer to complain against unfair trade practices and exploitation.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            Question 10:
           </strong>
           By what means can the consumers express their solidarity?

            Answer:
            <br/>
</strong>
           The consumer movement in India has evolved vastly since it began. There has been a significant change in consumer awareness in the country. Till the enactment of COPRA in 1986, the consumer movement did not bear much force, but ever since its inception, the movement has been empowered substantially. The setting up of consumer courts and consumer groups has been a progressive move. However, in contemporary India, the consumer redressal process is quite complicated, expensive and time-consuming. Filing cases, attending court proceedings, hiring lawyers, and other procedures make it cumbersome. In India, there are over 700 consumer groups of which, unfortunately, only about 20-25 are well-organized and functioning smoothly.
