           Answer:
           <br/>
           Torque on electric dipole. Consider an electric dipole consisting of two equal and opposite point charges separated by a small distance 2a having dipole moment | \(\vec{p}\) | = q (2 \(\vec{a}\))
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Class 12 Physics Question Paper 2020 (Series HMJ5) with Solutions 36" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-169354" height="159" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CBSE-Class-12-Physics-Question-Paper-2020-Series-HMJ5-with-Solutions-36.png" width="228"/>
<br/>
           Let the dipole held in a uniform external electric field at an angle θ
           <br/>
           ∴ Force on charge (+q) = q \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{E}}\) along the direction of \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{E}}\)
           <br/>
           Force on charge (-q) = -q \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{E}}\) along the opposite direction of \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{E}}\)
           <br/>
           ∴ Net translatory force on the dipole = q \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{E}}\) – q \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{E}}\) = 0
           <br/>
           So net force on the dipole is zero
           <br/>
           Since \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{E}}\) is uniform, hence the dipole does not undergo any translatory motion.
           <br/>
           These forces being equal, unlike and parallel, form a couple, which rotates the dipole in clock-wise direction
           <br/>
           ∴ Magnitude of torque = Force × arm of couple
           <br/>

<br/>
           (b) Stopping potential will remain same, if the distance between the light source and the surface of metal A is increased.
           <br/>
           Justification. Variation of distance of light source from the metal surface will alter the intensity, while the stopping potential depends only on the frequency and not on the intensity of incident light.

           Question 26.
           <br/>
           Use Bohr’s model of hydrogen atom to obtain the relationship between the angular momentum and the magnetic moment of the revolving electron. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:

           Question 27.
           <br/>
           In a single slit diffraction experiment, the width of the slit is doubled. How will the (i) size and (ii) intensity of central bright band be affected? Justify your answer. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           According to Huygen’s principle “The net effect at any point due to a number of wavelets is equal to sum total of contribution of all wavelets with proper phase difference.”
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Class 12 Physics Question Paper 2020 (Series HMJ5) with Solutions 20" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-169337" height="150" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CBSE-Class-12-Physics-Question-Paper-2020-Series-HMJ5-with-Solutions-20.png" width="178"/>
<br/>
           The point O is maxima because contribution from each half of the slit S

           S

            2
           </sub>
           is in phase, i.e., the path difference is zero.
           <br/>
           At point P
           <br/>
           (a) If S
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           P = S
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           P = nλ ⇒ the point P would be minima
           <br/>
           (b) If S
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           P – S
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           P = (2n + 1)\(\frac{\lambda}{2}\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ the point would be maxima 1ut with decreasing intensity.
           <br/>
           ∴ The width of central maxima = \(\frac{2 \lambda \mathrm{D}}{a}\)
           <br/>
           β = \(\frac{\lambda \mathrm{D}}{a}\) …when [β is the fringe width
           <br/>
           If width is doubled, then d’ = 2d ⇒ β’ = \(\frac{\beta}{2}\)
           <br/>
           When width of slit is doubled, contrast between maxima and minima decreases due to the overlapping of interference patterns formed by various narrow pairs of the slits.
           <br/>
           Therefore, size of central maxima will be reduced to half and intensity of central maxima will be four times.

            Output is taken from between the common- point of the two diodes and secondary of the transformer. Hence, the secondary of the transformer is provided with center tapping and is also called the centre-tap transformer.
           </li>
<li>
            Let, the input voltage to A with respect to the centre be positive and, at the same instant, voltage at B being out-of phase will be negative. Therefore, diode D

             1
            </sub>
            isforward biased and starts conducting whereas, D

            being reverse biased does not conduct.
           </li>
<li>
            Thus, we get an output current and an output voltage across the load resistance R

            in the first positive half-cycle.
           </li>
<li>
            During the course of the negative half-cycle, that is, when voltage at A becomes negative and voltage at B becomes positive, we will have D

            as reverse biased and D

            forward biased.
           </li>
<li>
            In the negative part of the cycle, only diode D2 will conduct giving an output current and output voltage across R

            .

            For both positive and negative half cycle we will get the output voltage. This rectified output voltage has the shape of half sinusoids.

           Question 32.
           <br/>
           An optical instrument uses a lens of power 100 D for objective lens and 50 D for its eyepiece. When the tube length is kept at 25 cm. the final image is formed at infinity.

How will the angle of emergence change qualitatively, if the ray of light emerges from the prism into a liquid of refractive index 1.3 instead of air? [5]

<br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) (i) Focal length of a mirror is defined as the distance of point from the pole of a mirror through which ray of light moving parallel to its principle axis passes (or apper to come from). It is denoted by f and f = \(\frac{R}{2}\)
           <br/>
           (ii) Relationship between the focal length and radius of curvature. The geometry of reflection of an incident ray is show in the figure.
           <br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-169343" height="123" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CBSE-Class-12-Physics-Question-Paper-2020-Series-HMJ5-with-Solutions-26.png" width="292"/>
<br/>
           C is the centre of curvature of the mirror. A ray parallel to principal axis strikes the mirror at M. CM is the perpendicular to the mirror at M. Let θ be the angle of incidence and MD is the perpendicular to the mirror at M.
           <br/>
           ∠MCP = θ and ∠MFP = 2θ
           <br/>
           Now, tan θ = \(\frac{M D}{C D}\) and tan 2θ = \(\frac{M D}{\overline{F D}}\) …….. (i)
           <br/>
           For small values of θ, tan θ = θ and tan 2θ = 2θ, therefore equation (i) gives
           <br/>
           \(\frac{\mathrm{MD}}{\mathrm{FD}}\) = 2\(\frac{M D}{C D}\) or FD = \(\frac{C D}{2}\) ……….. (ii)
           <br/>
           Now, for small θ, the point D is very close to the point P.
           <br/>
           ∴ FD = f and CD = R. Thus equation (ii) gives f = \(\frac{R}{2}\).
          </p>
<p>
           (b) Given, μ of glass prism, \(\left(a_{\mu_g}\right)\) = \(\sqrt{3}\) ;
           <br/>
           μ of liquid \(\left(a_{\mu_l}\right)\) = 1.3
           <br/>
           It can be easily seen that the angle of incidence on the surface AB i.e., ∠A = 30°, because it is a right-angled prism with ∠B = 90° and also ∠C is 60°.
           <br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-169344" height="147" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CBSE-Class-12-Physics-Question-Paper-2020-Series-HMJ5-with-Solutions-27.png" width="158"/>
<br/>
           Applying Snell’s law at face AB when emerging out in air from glass prism, \(g_{\mu_a}\) = \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\)
           <br/>
           \(g_{\mu_a}\) = \(\frac{\sin (i)}{\sin (e)}\) = \(\frac{\sin \left(30^{\circ}\right)}{\sin (e)}\) = \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\)
           <br/>
           sin (e) = \(\sqrt{3}\) × sin(30°) = \(\sqrt{3} \times \frac{1}{2}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) = sin(60°) ∴ ∠e = 60°
           <br/>
           When the medium (air) in which the prism is kept, is replaced with a liquid of refractive index 1.3, the angle of emergence would decrease. It is because the bending in the ray of light would be lesser.
           <br/>
           According to Snell’s law,
           <br/>
           \(\sqrt{3}\) × sin(30°) = 1.3 × sin(e)
           <br/>
           sin(e) = \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{1.3 \times 2}\) = 0.66 ∴ ∠e = 41.83°

           (ii) When this inductor is used in series with a capacitor of unknown value and a resistor of 10 Ω at 300 s

            -1
           </sup>
           , maximum power dissipation occurs in the circuit. Calculate the capacitance of the capacitor. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) From the graph, it is seen that inductive reactance (X
           <sub>
            L
           </sub>
           ) of 20 Ω corresponds to the value of frequency (f) 100 Hz.

           = ωL …where [ω = 2πf

           ∴ X
           <sub>
            L
           </sub>
           = 2πfL
           <br/>
           ⇒ L = \(\frac{X_L}{2 \pi f}\) = \(\frac{20}{2 \times 3.14 \times 100}\) = 0.03184 H
           <br/>
           ∴ L = 31.84 × 10
           <sup>
            -3
           </sup>
           ≈ 32 mH
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) As we know, maximum power dissipation takes place when X
           <sub>
            L
           </sub>
           = X
           <sub>
            C
           </sub>
           or ωL = \(\frac{1}{\omega \mathrm{C}}\)
           <br/>
           C = \(\frac{1}{\omega^2 L}\) = \(\frac{1}{(2 \pi f)^2} \times \frac{1}{\mathrm{~L}}\) = \(\frac{1}{4 \times(3.14 \times 3.14)} \times \frac{1}{(300 \times 300)} \times \frac{1}{\left(32 \times 10^{-3}\right)}\)
           <br/>
           ∴ C = 8.8 × 10
           <sup>
            -6

           Question 37.
           <br/>
           (a) Write two important characteristics of equipotential surfaces.
           <br/>
           (b) The magnitude of electric field (in NC
           <sup>
            -1
           </sup>
           ) in a region varies with the distance r(in m) as
           <br/>
           E = 10 r + 5
           <br/>
           By how much does the electric potential increase in moving from point at r = 1 m to a point at r = 10 m. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Properties of equipotential surfaces:
           <br/>
           (i) No work is done in moving a test charge over an equipotential surface.
           <br/>
           (ii) No two equipotential surfaces can intersect each other.
           <br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-169345" height="179" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CBSE-Class-12-Physics-Question-Paper-2020-Series-HMJ5-with-Solutions-28.png" width="183"/>
<br/>
           (iii) Equipotential surface due to an isolated point charge is spherical.
           <br/>
           (iv) The electric field at every point is normal to the equipotential surface passing through that point. As E = \(\frac{-d \mathrm{~V}}{d r}\)
           <br/>
           or dr = \(\frac{-d \mathrm{~V}}{\mathrm{E}}\)
           <br/>
           For the same charge in the value, V, i.e., when dV = constant, we have dr ∝ \(\frac{1}{\mathrm{E}}\)
           <br/>
           Hence, equipotential surface gets closer as the distance between the equipotential surface and the source charge decreases.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) Given. E = lOr + 5
           <br/>
           We know, dv = –\(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{E}} \cdot \overrightarrow{d r}\)
           <br/>
           Integrating both sides

           <br/>
           (a) The wave theory of light could not explain the existence of the threshold frequency.
           <br/>
           (b) The photo electric current increases with increase of intensity of incident light. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) According to wave theory, threshold frequency should not exist. Light of all frequencies should emit electrons, provided intensity of light is sufficient for electrons to eject.
           <br/>
           (b) When intensity of incident light increases, the number of incident photons increases, as one photon ejects one electron, the increase in intensity will increase the number of ejected electrons. In other words, photo current will increase with increase of intensity.

           Question 24.
           <br/>
           Calculate for how many years will the fusion of 2.0 kg deuterium keep 800 W electric lamp glowing. Take the fusion reaction as
           <br/>
           \({ }_1^2 \mathrm{H}\) + \({ }_1^2 \mathrm{H}\) → \({ }_2^3 \mathrm{He}\) + \({ }_0^1 \mathrm{n}\) + 3.27 MeV [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Given. Fusion reaction = \({ }_1^2 \mathrm{H}+{ }_1^2 \mathrm{H}\) → \({ }_2^3 \mathrm{He}+{ }_0^1 \mathrm{n}+3.27\) MeV
           <br/>
           Mass of deuterium, m = 2.0 kg
           <br/>
           Power of electric lamp, P = 800 W or 800 J/s
           <br/>
           Number of years (y) = ?
           <br/>
           Avagadro number (N) = 6.023 × 10
           <sup>
            23
           </sup>
<br/>
           1 mole i.e., 2g of deuterium contains = 6.023 × 10
           <sup>
            23
           </sup>
           atoms
           <br/>
           So, 2.0 kg of deuterium contains = \(\frac{\left(6.023 \times 10^{23}\right) \times(2,000)}{2}\) = 6.023 × 10

            26
           </sup>
           atoms
           <br/>
           Since 2 atoms of deuterium fuse to release 3.27 MeV energy,
