           1. Read the following sentences carefully :
           <br/>
           (i) Birds fly in the air.
           <br/>
           (ii) My brother flew to England last week.
           <br/>
           (iii) I shall fly a kite on Sunday.
           <br/>
           In the first sentence the Verb fly’ refers to the Present time, in the sec¬ond sentence the Verb ‘flew’ refers to the action in the Past, while the Verb in the third sentence ‘shall fly’ refers to the Future.
          </p>
<p>
           2. The Tense of a Verb shows the time when an action takes place.
           <br/>
           There are three Tenses :
           <br/>
           I. Present Tense
           <br/>
           II. Past Tense
           <br/>
           III. Future Tense
          </p>
<p>
           3. In order to show at what stage an action is, each of the three tenses has been sub-divided into four heads. These sub-divisions are—

            B. Present Continuous Tense
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            [Is/am/are + Verb + trig)
            <br/>
</strong>
           (i) In order to form the Present Continuous Tense, we add Present Par¬ticiple to is, am or are. The Present Participle is formed by adding ‘ing’ to the first form of the verb.
           <br/>
           7s’ is used with he, she, it or Third Person Singular Noun, ‘am’ is used with ‘I’ and ‘are’ is used with we, you, they and plural Nouns.
           <br/>
           Examples : She is singing a song.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) In Interrogative form, the helping verb is used before the subject.
           <br/>
           [Is/am/are + Subject + (Verb + ing) ?]
           <br/>
           Examples : Are you going home ?
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) In Negative form, we add ‘not between the Principal Verb and the operative helping verb.
           <br/>
           [Subject + is/am/are + not + (Verb + ing) …]
           <br/>
           Examples : She is not weeping.

            C. The Past Perfect Tense
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            (Subject + had + III form of the Verb)
            <br/>
</strong>
           We often make mistakes while using the Past Perfect Tense. We use ‘had’ at random wherever we view ‘past action’ in a sentence in otir mother- tongue.
           <br/>
           I had gone to Delhi yesterday.
           <br/>
           This sentence should be formed in Simple past
           <br/>
           I went to Delhi yesterday.
           <br/>
           The structure of Past Perfect is—
           <br/>
           In order to form the Past Perfect Tense we use ‘had before the Past Participle (III) form of the Verb.
          </p>
<p>
           (i) In Interrogative form [‘Had’ is used before the subject]
           <br/>
           [Had + Subject + not + inform of the Verb + ?)
           <br/>
           Had he left when you cams ?
           <br/>
           (ii) In Negative form [‘not is used after ‘had’]
           <br/>
           (Subject + had + not + III form of the Verb + )
           <br/>
           I had not seen you before.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            Uses of the Past Perfect Tense
           </strong>
<br/>
           (a) The Past Perfect Tense is used to express an action completed before another action took place ; as—
           <br/>
           When he came to me, I had posted the letter.
           <br/>
           (b) (i) It is also used to express an unfulfilled action in the past; as—
           <br/>
           If she had worked hard she would have passed.
           <br/>
           (ii) It is also used to express an unfulfilled wish in the past; as—
           <br/>
           I wish I had won the election.
           <br/>
           (c) To denote the action or event which has been completed before some point of time.
           <br/>
           By afternoon he had completed much work.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            Use of Past Indefinite and Past Perfect Tenses in Time Clauses.
           </strong>
<br/>
           We can express time by using some ‘time-denoting’ Adverbs or through Adverbial clauses of Time. The combination of two past actions depends upon their mutual relevance.
           <br/>
           Examples :
           <br/>
           I had waited for my friend until he arrived.
           <br/>
           After he had sailed many days, the mariner reached the coast.
