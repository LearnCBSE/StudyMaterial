           Velocity of sound = Frequency x wavelength
           <br/>
           Speed of sound in air is constant.
           <br/>
           Hence, frequency x wavelength = constant
           <br/>
           If frequency is doubled, wavelength is reduced to half.

           The frequency in hertz is equal to the number of waves produced per second. In this case, 20 waves are produced per second, so the frequency of sound waves is 20 hertz.

           (a) Sound is that form of energy which makes us hear. Sound waves are longitudinal waves in air.
           <br/>
           (b) Sound cannot travel through vacuum. This can be shown by the following experiment:
           <br/>
           (i) A ringing electric bell is placed inside an air tight glass jar containing air. We can hear the sound of ringing bell clearly. Thus, when air is present as medium in the bell jar, sound can travel through it and reach our ears.
           <br/>
           (ii) The bell jar containing ringing bell is placed over the plate of a vacuum pump. Air is gradually removed from the bell jar by switching on the vacuum pump. As more and more air is removed from the bell jar, the sound of ringing bell becomes fainter and fainter. And when all the air is removed from the bell jar, no sound can be heard at all. Thus, when vacuum is created in the bell jar, then the sound of ringing bell placed inside it cannot be heard.
           <br/>
           This shows that sound cannot travel through vacuum.

           <br/>
           (b) When an object vibrates (and makes sound), then the air layers around it also start vibrating in exactly the same way and carry sound waves from the sound producing object to our ears.
           <br/>
           Suppose a tuning fork is vibrating and producing sound waves in air. Since the prongs of the tuning fork are vibrating, the individual layers of air are also vibrating. Sound travels in the form of longitudinal waves in which the back and forth vibrations of the air layers are in the same direction as the movement of sound wave.

<br/>
           (a) When we put our ear to a railway line, we can hear the sound of an approaching train even when the train is far off but its sound cannot be heard through the air. This is due to the fact that sound travels much more fast through the railway line made of steel than through air.
           <br/>
           (b) There is no actual movement of air from the sound-producing body to our ear. The air layers only vibrate back and forth, and transfer the sound energy from one layer to the next layer till it reaches our ear.
           <br/>
           This will be clear from an example: If we turn on a gas tap for a few seconds, a person standing a few metres away will hear the sound of escaping gas first and the smell of gas reaches him afterwards. The sound of gas travels through the vibrations of air layers so it reaches first, but the smell of gas reaches the person through the actual movement of the air layers, which takes more time. So, it is clear that the sound is not being transmitted by the actual movement of air from the gas tap to person, otherwise he would hear and smell the gas at the same time.

           We hear more clearly in a room with curtains than in a room without curtains because curtains are bad reflectors of sound. They absorb most of the sound falling on them, and hence do not produce echoes. On the other hand, in rooms without curtains, there is a greater reflection of sound due to which some echoes are produced.
           <br/>
           These echoes cause a hindrance to hearing.

           The soundboard is a concave board (curved board) which is placed behind the speaker in large halls or auditoriums so that his speech can be easily heard even by the persons sitting at a considerable distance. The sound board works as follows: the speaker is made to stand at the focus of the concave soundboard. The concave surface of the soundboard reflects the sound waves of the speaker towards the audience (and hence prevents the spreading of sound in various directions). Due to this, sound is distributed uniformly throughout the hall and even the persons sitting at the back of the hall can hear the speech easily.

           Quality (or timbre) is that characteristic of the sound by which we can distinguish between sounds of same pitch and loudness produced by different musical instruments (and different singers). The quality (or timbre) depends on the shape of the sound wave (or waveform) produced by it.

           When we strike a table lightly, then due to less energy supplied, the table top vibrates with a small amplitude and hence a soft sound is produced. However if we hit the table hard, due to greater energy supplied, the table top vibrates with a large amplitude and hence a loud sound is produced.

           Bats emit high frequency ultrasonic squeaks while flying and listen to the echoes produced by the reflection of their squeaks from their prey. From the time taken by the echo to be heard, bats can judge the distance of the prey in their path and catch it.

           Ultrasound waves are made to pass through one face of the metal block and ultrasound detectors are placed on the opposite face of the block to detect the transmitted ultrasound waves.
           <br/>
           (i) If the ultrasound waves pass uninterrupted through all parts of the metal block, then the block is flawless.
           <br/>
           (ii) However, if the ultrasound waves are not able to pass through a part of the metal block and get reflected back, then there is a flaw in the metal block.

           Construction of human ear:
           <br/>
           The ear consists of three compartments: outer ear, middle ear and inner ear. The outer ear consists of broad part called pinna and about 2 to 3 centimeters long passage called ear canal. At the end of ear canal is a thin, elastic, circular membrane called tympanum or ear-drum. The middle ear contains three small delicate bones called hammer, anvil and stirrup. These bones are linked to one another. The one end of hammer is touching the ear drum and its other end is connected to the second bone called anvil. The other end of anvil is connected to the third bone called stirrup. And the free end of stirrup is held against the membrane over the oval window of the inner ear. The lower part of middle ear has Eustachian tube going to the throat. The inner ear has a coiled structure called cochlea. The cochlea is filled with liquid containing sound sensitive nerve cells. The other side of cochlea is connected to the auditory nerve which goes to the brain.
           <br/>
           Working of human ear:
           <br/>
           The sound waves are collected by the pinna. These sound waves pass through ear canal and fall on the ear-drum. Sound waves consist of compressions and rarefactions. When the compression strikes the ear drum, the pressure on the outside of ear drum increases and pushes the ear drum inwards. And when rarefaction strikes the ear drum, the pressure on the outside of ear drum decreases and it moves outwards. Thus, when sound waves fall on the ear drum, it vibrates back and forth rapidly. These vibrations are passed onto the three bones in the middle ear and finally to the liquid in the cochlea. Due to this, liquid in the cochlea starts to vibrate, setting up electrical impulses in the nerve cells present in it. These impulses are carried to the brain by auditory nerve. The brain interprets the impulses and we get the sensation of hearing.
