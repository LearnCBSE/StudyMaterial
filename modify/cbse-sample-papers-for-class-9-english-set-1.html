           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the following text.
          </p>
<p>
           1. Every morning Ravi gives his brain an extra boost. We’re not talking about drinking strong cups of coffee or playing one of those mind-training video games advertised all over Facebook. “I jump onto my stationary bike and cycle for 45 minutes to work,” says Ravi. “When I go to my desk, my brain is at peak activity for a few hours.” After his mental focus comes to a halt later in the day, he starts it with another short spell of cycling to be able to run errands.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           2. Ride, work, ride, repeat. It’s a scientifically proven system that describes some unexpected benefits of cycling. In a recent study in the Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research, scientists found that people scored higher on tests of memory, reasoning, and planning after 30 minutes of spinning on a stationary bike than they did before they rode the bike. They also completed the tests faster after pedalling.
          </p>
<p>
           3. Exercise is like fertiliser for your brain. All those hours, spent on exercising your muscles, create rich capillary beds not only in leg and hip muscles, but also in your brain. More blood vessels in your brain and muscles – mean more oxygen and nutrients to help them work. When you pedal, you also force more nerve cells to fire. The result: you double or triple the production of these cells — literally building your brain. You also release neurotransmitters (the messengers between your brain cells) so all those cells, new and old, can communicate with each other for better, faster functioning. That’s a pretty profound benefit to cyclists.
          </p>
<p>
           4. This kind of growth is especially important with each passing birthday, because as we age, our brains shrink and those connections weaken. Exercise restores and protects the brain cells. Neuroscientists say, “Adults who exercise display sharper memory skills, higher concentration levels, more fluid thinking, and greater problem-solving ability than those who are sedentary.”
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           5. Cycling also elevates your mood, relieves anxiety, increases stress resistance, and even banishes the blues. “Exercise works in the same way as psychotherapy and antidepressants in the treatment of depression, maybe better,” says Dr. Manjari. A recent study 26 years of research finds that even some exercise – as little as 20 to 30 minutes a day – can prevent depression over the long term.
          </p>
<p>
           6. Remember : although it’s healthy, exercise itself is a stress, especially when you’re just getting started or getting back into riding. When you first begin to exert yourself, your body releases a particular hormone to raise your heart rate, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels, says Meher Ahluwalia, PhD, a professor of integrative physiology. As you get fitter, it takes a longer, harder ride to trigger that same response.
          </p>
<p>
           Answer the following questions, based on the passage above.
          </p>
<p>
           (i) Why does Ravi do a circuit of ‘ride’, work, ride?
           <br/>
           (A) because he wants to stay focused.
           <br/>
           (B) because after cycling to work, his brain is at the peak of activity level.
           <br/>
           (C) Both (A) and (B)
           <br/>
           (D) Neither (A) nor (B)

          </p>
<p>
           (ii) What are some benefits of cycling on the brain, according to the passage? Answer in about 40 words.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Some benefits of cycling on the brain include improved memory, reasoning, and planning skills, increased production of nerve cells, better communication between brain cells, and protection against age-related brain shrinkage.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           (iii) Complete the sentence appropriately:
           <br/>

           Answer:
           <br/>
           30 minutes
          </p>
<p>
           (vi) How does exercise benefit the brain according to the passage? Answer in about 40 words.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           According to the passage, exercise benefits the brain by creating rich capillary beds, increasing blood flow and oxygen supply, promoting the growth of nerve cells, improving communication between brain cells, and protecting and restoring brain cells.
          </p>
<p>
           (vii) Based on the understanding of the passage, choose the option that lists the correct sequence of ‘How is exercise itself a stress?
           <br/>
           1. The body releases a particular hormone.
           <br/>
           2. As one gets fitter, it takes a longer and more rigorous exercising to trigger the same response.
           <br/>
           3. As soon as one starts exercising, the body reacts immediately.
           <br/>
           4. That hormone raises one’s heart rate, blood pressure and blood glucose levels.
          </p>
<p>
           (A) 1, 2, 3, 4
           <br/>

          </p>
<p>
           (viii) According to the above passage, what is the work of neurotransmitters?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           They are like messengers between your brain cells. With the help of neurotransmitters, cells can communicate with each other. It makes the functioning better and faster.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Read the following text.
          </p>
<p>
           1. Andy Dehart is a shark expert and TV presenter who lives in the United States of America. He has had a lifelong interest in sharks and is always trying to look for ways to educate the public about them. Many people think that sharks have little or no intelligence, but Andy points out that recent studies have shown thatmany shark species possess powerful problem-solving abilities and social skills. “Sharks do not want to attack humans,” he asserts. “There is no shark species that eats humans as part of its regular diet. In most shark attack cases, sharks leave after realising that it has mistakenly bitten a human and not its intended prey.”
          </p>

</p>
<p>
           2. In Andy’s opinion, all shark fishing should be stopped until the shark populations have had time to grow again. We then need to do a better job of managing the fishing of sharks. However, even if the direct fishing of sharks is stopped, many will still be killed when they are caught up in the nets of boats fishing for other species of fish.
          </p>
<p>
           3. When Andy was a boy, his father worked for a national oceanic organisation, and Andy travelled with him all over the Caribbean. He grew up by the coast and he has been connected with the sea for as long as he can remember. He also lived near one of the best aquariums in America. Andy then went on to build a career working with sharks in an aquarium environment. More recently, he has been involved with television and the making of programmes about the sharks.
          </p>
<p>
           4. Andy and his wife had their first child two years ago. They were amused and amazed to see to what extent their work with animals has proved to be useful in bringing up their daughter. They know how to observe her behaviour and teach her how to do things by rewarding her.
          </p>
<p>
           5. Andy loves sharks and is very passionate about their survival and protection. He feels extremely lucky to have had opportunities working at the National Aquarium and the television station which presents the Nature Channel. He never wastes a moment in either place that could be spent educating people about sharks. He does admit that it is probably not possible for everyone to love sharks as he does. However, he does hope to persuade people personally or through the media to respect sharks and the critical role they play in our environment. His main objective is to keep spreading awareness that sharks are not dangerous man-eaters but essential creatures in our oceans, as they provide ecological balance and help to control other species.
          </p>

          </p>
<p>
           Sachin Tendulkar, born on April 24, 1973, in Mumbai, is a name that reverberates through the history of cricket. His journey towards greatness began at the tender age of 2 /i when he started hitting a ball with a broomstick in the confines of his backyard. It was in 1983, while watching a World Cup cricket match on television, that his interest in the game turned into a burning passion.

<p>
           In 1986, Tendulkar achieved a remarkable milestone by scoring his first century in school. Just two years later, he etched his name in the record books by setting a world record of 664 runs for Shardashram School in an inter-school tournament, alongside his talented partner Vinod Kambli.

           As I walked home from school one afternoon, a sense of curiosity piqued within me as I spotted a peculiar truck parked outside my house. With each step, my anticipation grew, and I quickened my pace. Bursting through the front door, I was met with an astonishing sight. The spacious living room had been transformed into a bustling workshop. Tools scattered across the floor, vibrant paints lined the makeshift table, and an array of wooden boards leaned against the walls.
          </p>
<p>
           The air was thick with the scent of fresh sawdust. In the midst of this organised chaos, a group of artisans diligently worked on their craft, their hands gracefully shaping – and carving intricate designs. I stood in awe, captivated by the beauty of their creations. It was as if a world of artistry had magically materialised within the confines of my humble abode.

           Dear Diary,
          </p>
<p>
           Today, I made a decision to lend a helping hand to my mother, who always seems to be busy with domestic chores. It has been on my mind for quite some time now, and I felt that it was time to take action. As I saw her tirelessly moving from one task to another, I realised the immense effort she puts into maintaining our home.
          </p>
<p>
           With determination, I approached her and offered my assistance. At first, she seemed surprised but grateful for my willingness to help. Together, we tackled the household chores as a team. I took charge of cleaning the living room, while she focused on cooking our meals. We communicated, laughed, and bonded over our shared responsibilities.
          </p>
<p>
           It was an eye-opening experience for me. I gained a newfound appreciation for my mother’s dedication and the amount of work she handles each day. By lending a hand, I not only lightened her burden but also deepened our connection.
          </p>
<p>
           Today’s experience taught me the value of teamwork, empathy, and the importance of supporting one another in our daily lives. I’m . determined to continue helping my mother and contribute to the well-being of our family.
          </p>

           Encounter with Policemen
          </p>
<p>
           It was 2001. I was about to leave the city for my village by train. I saw some policemen coming towards me. At first, I got scared seeing them, but when one of them asked me, “Where are you going, son?” I felt very good. I hesitantly replied, “I’m going back to my village, sir.” The policeman smiled warmly and said, “That’s . great! Take care and have a safe journey.”
          </p>
<p>
           His kind words reassured me, and I felt a sense of comfort. It made me realise that not all encounters with the police are negative. They are there to protect and help us. As the train departed, I couldn’t help but appreciate the humanity I witnessed in that brief interaction. It was a small reminder that kindness and compassion can be found in unexpected places, even in the eyes of a policeman.

           (B) What do the two roads symbolise in the first stanza? What is the significance of choosing a road?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The two roads that the poet-traveller faces in his walk or journey are symbolic of the choices , that we have to make in our life. The journey or a simple walk itself is a metaphor for the great journey of life whether one should adopt the way of spiritualism or materialism. In this poem, the poet, after prolonged thought, decides to take the road less travelled, road which is the road of spiritualism accepting its challenges and uncertainties. The decision is final and irreversible and it has its own consequences, may be positive or negative.
          </p>
<p>
           In real life also, we confront such critical situations where we face life-altering options. The decision we make is crucial. We should contemplate over the choices before and then decide our priorities. Once, we make the decision and proceed accordingly, we can never reverse it. The life takes its own course and it does not give a second chance to alter our decision and change our course of life. Hence, we should decide wisely about the choices we make.
