            “Innovation is the hallmark of entrepreneurship”. Yes, it is correct. It inspires entrepreneurial thinking, dream big and make things happen.” It is the specific tool of entrepreneurs, by which they exploit change as an opportunity for a different business services. It is capable of being presented as a discipline, capable of being learned, capable of being practised.
            <br/>
            The ‘dictionary’ meaning of innovation is “Introduction of new things”. Innovation involves problem solving and entrepreneur is a problem solver. So innovation is the mean of exploiting a business opportunity. All goods and services are produced by combining three factors:
            <br/>
            Natural, physical and mental labour and capital. An innovation is a new combination of these three things.
            <br/>
            According to Schumpeter, the basic function of entrepreneur was to innovate.
            <br/>
            He says that entrepreneur is basically an innovator and he introduce something newr in the economy.
            <br/>
            According to him, an entrepreneur is one who carries out new combination of mean of production.
            <br/>
<strong>
             The process of innovation-may be in following forms:
            </strong>
<ul>
<li>
              Introduction of new products, totally new to the consumers.
             </li>
<li>
              Use of new method of production, which is not yet introduced by any other.
             </li>
<li>
              Find new market for a product or services.
             </li>
<li>
              A new form of organization like monopoly position in the market.
             </li>
<li>
              Find new use of a product/services.
             </li>
<li>
              Improve an existing product or services.
             </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
            An entrepreneur is someone who organizes, manages, and assumes the risks of a business or enterprise. An entrepreneur is an agent of change. Entrepreneurship is the process of discovering new ways of combining resources. When the market value generated by this new combination of resources is greater than the market value these resources can generate elsewhere individually or in some other combination, the entrepreneur makes a profit. An entrepreneur who takes the resources necessary to produce a pair of jeans that can be sold for thirty dollars and instead turns them into a denim backpack that sells for fifty dollars will earn a profit by increasing the value those resources create. This comparison is possible because in competitive resource markets, an entrepreneur’s costs of production are determined by the prices required to bid the necessary resources away from alternative uses.
