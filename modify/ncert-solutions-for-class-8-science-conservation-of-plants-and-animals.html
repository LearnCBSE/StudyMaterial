           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Discuss the effects of deforestation on the following:
           <br/>
           (a) Wild animals
           <br/>
           (b) Environment
           <br/>
           (c) Villages (Rural areas)
           <br/>
           (d) Cities (Urban areas)
           <br/>
           (e) Earth
           <br/>
           (f) The next generation
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Wild animals: Trees are the habitats as well as sources of food for the wild animals. Deforestation leads to the destruction of the natural habitats of wild animals.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) Environment: Deforestation increases the temperature and pollution level of the environment. With the increase in the carbon dioxide level and a decrease in the oxygen level, it gives rise to global warming. It also lowers the level of ground water. Moreover, deforestation decreases the soil fertility and so, increases the chances of natural calamities.
          </p>
<p>
           (c) Villages (Rural areas): The decline in rainfall, the decrease in soil fertility, and the chances of natural disaster affect the village life.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           (d) Cities (Urban areas): Deforestation result in global warming. It also results in the increase in the level of pollution. Hence, deforestation affects the life in cities.
          </p>
<p>
           (e) Earth: Deforestation decreases the fertility of soil. It changes the physical properties of soil. All these changes result in desertification.
          </p>
<p>
           (f) The next generation: Deforestation will majorly affect the life of next generation. The next generation will face problems at every step. Climatic conditions will be adversely affected. There will be scarcity of food and clean environment. Next generation won’t be able to see most of the animal species due to habitat loss.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           What will happen if
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            we go on cutting trees

           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Answer:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            The variety in life existing on the earth, their inter-relationships, and their relationships with the environment is referred to as biodiversity. We should conserve biodiversity so as to maintain the food chain. The disturbance in the food chain may affect the whole ecosystem.
           </li>
<li>
            Since capturing and killing of animals by poachers is still rampant in protected forests and areas, so they are not safe for wild animals.
           </li>
<li>
            Some tribes depend on the jungle for the fulfillment of their basic needs of life, such as food, medicine, clothing, shelter, etc.
           </li>
<li>
            The causes of deforestation may be the following:
            <ul>
<li>
              Natural causes like forest fires, droughts, etc.
             </li>
<li>
              Building factories and houses.
             </li>
<li>
              Procuring land for cultivation.
             </li>
<li>
              Making furniture and using wood as fuel.
              <br/>
              The consequences of deforestation are:
             </li>
<li>
              Natural calamities like floods, etc.
             </li>
<li>
              Increase in the temperature of the earth, i.e., global warming.
             </li>
<li>
              Change in the physical properties of soil.
             </li>
<li>
              A decrease in groundwater level.
             </li>
<li>
              Extinction of many flora and fauna.
             </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
            Red Data Book is a sourcebook which keeps records of all endangered plants and animals.
           </li>
<li>
            Migration means the movement of a species from its own habitat to some other place during a certain period in a year for breeding or to overcome some climatic conditions.

<p>
           Question 6.
           <br/>
           In order to meet the ever-increasing demand in factories and for shelter, trees are being continually cut. Is it justified to cut trees for such projects? Discuss and prepare a brief report.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           It’s not justified to cut trees just to fulfill our needs. Trees are known as ‘the lung of the earth’. They are the habitat of many living organisms, including animals. They give us oxygen, and maintain the O
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           -CO
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           balance as well. They firmly bind the soil and hence prevent soil erosion. They also reduce the chances of natural disasters like floods and droughts. They help conserve our rich biodiversity. The cutting of trees causes an increase in the carbon dioxide (CO
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           ) level, which results in global warming. Moreover, it causes soil erosion, floods, the greenhouse effect, etc. Hence, trees must be protected.

           <br/>
           How can you contribute to the maintenance of green wealth of your locality? Make a list of actions to be taken by you.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           By taking up the following actions, I can contribute to the maintenance of green wealth of my locality by:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Planting saplings and trees.
           </li>
<li>
            Not throwing the garbage on the streets.
           </li>
<li>
            Forbidding others to cut trees.
           </li>
<li>
            Making people aware of the significance of a clean and green environment.
           </li>
<li>
            Watering the plants regularly and taking proper care of them.
           </li>

</ul>
<p>
           Question 8.
           <br/>
           Explain how deforestation leads to reduced rainfall.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Trees give out a huge amount of water in the form of water vapour during transpiration. The reduction of water vapour affects cloud formation and thus, results in less rainfall.

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Why should paper be saved? Prepare a list of ways by which you can save paper.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A large number of trees can be saved by saving paper. This will also save water that is used to manufacture paper. Moreover, the harmful chemicals used in papermaking will show their least effects on human beings and other organisms.
           <br/>
           Some ways to save paper are the following:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            recycling of paper.
           </li>
<li>

           <br/>
           Solution:
           <br/>
           A zoo tends to provide suitable conditions for the animals to live in, similar to their natural habitat.
           <br/>
           Yes, animals can live in an artificial setting instead of their natural habitat, as they live in natural environment and stay protected*from people.
           <br/>
           As per my opinion, animals are safer in the zoo in comparison with their natural environment, because special care is taken for the animals in the zoo. But I think animals feel more comfortable to live in their natural habitat as no one wants to live in prison.

<p>
<span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer:
           </span>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
            If we go on cutting trees, rainfall and fertility of the soil will decrease. The chances of natural calamities such as floods and drought will increase. It will lead to decrease in the water holding capacity of the soil and movement of water from the soil surface into the ground. Animal life is also affected by deforestation.
           </li>
<li>
            If the habitat of an animal is disturbed, it endangers their existence. Survival of some animals becomes difficult because of the disturbances in their natural habitat.
           </li>
<li>
            Removal of the top layer of soil exposes the lower hard and rocky layers. This soil has less humus and it is less fertile. Gradually the fertile land can convert into deserts.

            Question 8.
           </span>
<br/>
           “Water is renewable but oil is not”. Explain.
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer:
           </span>
<br/>
           Water evaporates from forest and other vegetation and condenses in the upper layers of the atmosphere to form clouds and then it rains. The water goes down in the soil and is therefore, a renewable source.
           <br/>
           Oil is found below the earth in crude form. It is formed after millions of years. When the oil is used, it is lost. Therefore, it is not a renewable source.

           What is the difference in conservation of renewable and non-renewable resources ?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer:
           </span>
<br/>
           Conserving of renewable resources is to utilise them in such a way that nature is able to replenish them as fast as they are used. In the case of non-renewable resources it is not so. These resources take a long time in their formation and will get finished very soon. So, they should be used judiciously.

           “Conservation of resources means not only using the resources judiciously but also maintaining their quality”. Discuss.
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer:
           </span>
<br/>
           This statement is correct because if we have the resources of poor quality, it is of no use. We may have enough water, but if it is polluted it causes more harm than benefit. It causes many diseases in human beings and animals. Polluted air causes more harm in many cities as people get many diseases.

<br/>
           Why is managing of resources not very simple ?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer:
           </span>
<br/>
           Managing resources is not very simple because the problems are inter related. Solving one problem leads to another problem. Banning of insecticides will save wildlife but will lead to shortage of food due to destruction of crops by insects. So, we can say that banning of one thing leads to shortage of another thing.

<p>
<span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer:
           </span>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
            The roots of trees helps to find the soil and prevent soil erosion. Rows of trees planted along the edges of farms act as wind breakers and prevent erosion by wind.
           </li>
<li>
            Chemical fertilisers damage the porous structure of the soil and also kill soil organisms such as earthworms which add loose fertile soil to the fields.
