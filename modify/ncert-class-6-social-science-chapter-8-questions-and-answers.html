           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The national anthem, “Jana Gana Mana,” beautifully embodies the spirit of “unity in diversity” that defines India. While the lyrics themselves are written in Bengali, their translation captures the essence of a nation brimming with cultural richness, yet bound by a common thread of patriotism.
          </p>
<p>
           Celebrating Diversity: The anthem doesn’t shy away from showcasing India’s vibrant tapestry. Phrases like “Punjab Sindh Gujarat Maratha” and “Dravida Utkal Banga” paint a picture of a land where diverse regions and languages coexist. It mentions the majestic Himalayas, the life-giving rivers like the Ganga and the Yamuna, and the bountiful Indian Ocean, highlighting the geographical vastness and varied landscapes. This celebration of diversity fosters a sense of shared identity amongst all Indians, regardless of their background.
          </p>
<p>
           Unifying Threads: Despite the multitude of cultures and languages, the anthem emphasizes a sense of national unity. Words like “sindhu-sagar” (sea of Sindhu) and “Himachal-dravida” (Himalayas and Dravidian lands) create a sense of geographical and cultural integration.
          </p>
<p>
           The anthem addresses India as “bharat bhumi” (land of Bharat), a unifying term for the nation. Phrases like “jaya he” (victory to thee) and “jan-gana-mangal” (welfare of the whole people) evoke a collective spirit of patriotism and a shared aspiration for the nation’s progress.
          </p>
<p>
           In conclusion, the national anthem serves as a powerful symbol of India’s “unity in diversity.” It celebrates the rich tapestry of cultures and regions while simultaneously invoking a strong sense of belonging to one nation. The anthem serves as a reminder that India’s diversity is not a weakness, but a beautiful melody that creates a symphony of unity and national pride.

            Story: The Lion and the Mouse
           </li>
<li>
            Art Form: Sculpture
           </li>
<li>
            Description: One famous depiction of this story is the sculpture “The Lion and the Mouse” by Antonio Canova (1798). This sculpture shows a powerful lion with its paw resting gently on a tiny, frightened-looking mouse. The contrast in size highlights the stoijy’s theme of unexpected help coming from someone weak.
            <br/>
            Paintings: Many artists have portrayed this story in paintings. Popular examples include works by Etienne Delacroix (1842) and Ruth Gerson (1950s). These paintings often use dramatic lighting and contrasting sizes to convey the story’s essence.
           </li>
<li>
            Dance Performances: The story’s themes of power dynamics and unexpected assistance can be interpreted through dance. Modem dance or mime performances could use body language and movements to depict the lion’s initial anger and the mouse’s fear, culminating in a moment of understanding and cooperation.
            <br/>
            There are countless examples of fables and stories being depicted in art across different cultures.

           Question 6.
           <br/>
           Discuss in class the following quotation by India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, when he travelled to many parts of India before Independence:
           <br/>
           Everywhere I found a cultural background which had exerted a powerful influence on their lives. … The old epics of India, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata and other books, in pop-ular translations and paraphrases, were widely known among the masses, and every incident and story and moral in them was engraved on the popular mind and gave a richness and content to it. Illiterate villagers would know hundreds of verses by heart and their conversation would be full of references to them or to some story with a moral, enshrined in some old classic.”
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           This quote comes from his travels across India before independence and highlights a crucial facet of Indian society- the deep impact of its cultural heritage.
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Key Points: Widespread Cultural Impact: Nehru emphasizes that India’s cultural background significantly influenced the lives of people across the nation. This influence transcended social classes and locations.
           </li>
<li>
            Epics as Guiding Lights: He specifically mentions the Ramayana and Mahabharata, highlighting their popularity even in “illiterate villages.” These epics weren’t just stories; they were moral compasses with lessons deeply ingrained in people’s minds.
           </li>
<li>
            Enriched Lives: Nehru suggests that these epics provided “richness and content” to people’s lives, shaping their values and sense of identity.
           </li>
<li>
            Oral Traditions: He mentions the practice of memorizing verses and referencing them in everyday conversations. This highlights the importance of oral traditions in preserving and transmitting cultural knowledge.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           In conclusion, Jawaharlal Nehru’s insightful observation offers a glimpse into the enduring power of India’s cultural heritage. Epics like the Ramayana and Mahabharata, along with oral traditions, have profoundly shaped the values and identities of generations. By discussing this quote, we can gain a deeper appreciation for the rich tapestry of Indian culture and how it continues to influence the lives of people today.
