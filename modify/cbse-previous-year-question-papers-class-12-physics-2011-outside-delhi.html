           <br/>
           Define electric dipole moment. Write its S.I. unit. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           Electric dipole moment : Dipole moment is a measure of strength of electric dipole. It is vector quantity whose magnitude is equal to product of magnitude of charge and the distance between them.
           <br/>
           p = q x 2d
           <br/>
           SI unit of dipole moment is coulomb-metre (Cm).

<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Where on the surface of Earth is the angle of dip 90° ? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           Magnetic dip is the angle made by a compass needle with the horizontal point on earth’s surface. The angle of dip is 90° at the poles.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           A hollow metal sphere of radius 5 cm is charged such that the potential on its surface is 10 V. What is potential at the center of the sphere ? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           Potential inside the charged sphere is constant and equal to potential on the surface of the conductor. So, potential at the center of sphere is 10 V.

           Question 7.
           <br/>
           What happens to the width of depletion layer of a p-n junction when it is
           <br/>
           (i) forward biased,
           <br/>
           (ii) reverse biased ? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           (i) Forward biased : Potential drop across the junction decreases and diffusion of holes and electrons across the junction increases. It makes the width of the depletion layer smaller.
           <br/>
           (ii) Reverse biased : Potential drop across the junction increases and diffusion of holes and electrons across the junction decreases. It makes the width of the depletion layer larger.

           Question 8.
           <br/>
           Define the term ‘stopping potential’ in relation to photoelectric effect. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           Stopping potential is the minimum negative (retarding) potential of anode for which photo current stops or becomes zero. It is denoted by V
           <sub>
            s
           </sub>
           . The value of stopping potential is different for different metals but it is independent of the intensity of incident light and depends on the frequency of the incident light.

           Rectification : Rectification means conversion of ac into dc. A p-n diode acts as a rectifier because an ac changes polarity periodically and a p-n diode conducts only when it is forward biased; it does not conduct when it is reverse biased.
          </p>
<p>
           Working : The ac input voltage across secondary S
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           and S
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           changes polarity after each half cycle. Suppose during the first cycle of input ac signal, the terminal S
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           is positive relative to centre tap and S
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           is negative relative to it. Then diode D
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           is forward biased and D
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           is reverse biased. Therefore, diode D
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           conducts while D
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           does not. Thus, the current in load resistance R
           <sub>
            L
           </sub>
           is in the same direction for both half cycles of input ac signal and the output current is a continuous series of unidirectional pulses.
           <br/>
           In a full wave rectifier, if input frequency is f Hertz, then output frequency will be 2f Hertz because for each cycle of input, two positive half cycles of output are obtained.

           Question 24.
           <br/>
           (a) Using de-Broglie’s hypothesis, explain with the help of a suitable diagram, Bohr’s second postulate of quantization of energy levels in a hydrogen atom.
           <br/>
           (b) The ground state energy of hydrogen atom is -13.6 eV. What are the kinetic and potential energies of the electron in this state ? [3]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           (a) The second postulate of Bohr atom model says that angular momentum of electron orbiting around the nucleus is quantized, i.e.,
           <br/>
           \(m v r=\frac{n h}{2 \pi}, \text { where } n=1,2,3, \ldots . .\)
           <br/>
           According to de-Broglie, a stationary orbit is that which contains an integral number of de-Broglie waves associated with the revolving electron.

           Principle : Its working is based on the fact that when a current carrying coil is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque.
           <br/>
           Working : When current (I) is passed in the coil, torque t acts on the coil, given by
           <br/>
           T = NIAB sin θ
           <br/>
           where, θ = Angle between normal to plane of coil
           <br/>
           B = Magnetic field of strength
           <br/>
           N = No. of turns in a coil.
           <br/>
           For equilibrium,
           <br/>
           deflecting torque = restoring torque
           <br/>
           NIAB = Cθ
           <br/>
           \(\Rightarrow \quad \theta=\frac{\mathrm{NAB}}{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{I}\)
           <br/>
           where,  C = Torsional rigidity of the wire
           <br/>
           ⇒  θ ∝ I
           <br/>
           The deflection of coil is directly proportional to the current flowing in the coil.
           <br/>
           (b) Due to deflecting torque, the coil rotates and suspension wire gets twisted. A restoring torque is set up in the suspension wire.

<br/>
           It means voltage sensitivity is dependent on current sensitivity and resistance of galvanometer, R. If we increase current sensitivity and galvanometer resistance is high, then it is not certain that voltage sensitivity will be increased. Thus, the increase of current sensitivity does not imply the increase of voltage sensitivity.

<br/>
           Working : When a coil (armature) rotates inside a uniform magnetic field, magnetic flux linked with the coil changes w.r.t. time. This produces an e.m.f. according to Faraday’s law.
          </p>
<p>
           For first half of the rotation, the current will be from one end (first ring) to the other end (second ring). For second half of the rotation, it is in opposite sense.
          </p>

           To calculate the magnitude of e.m.f. induced, Suppose
           <br/>
           N = number of turns in the coil.

           be applied across a pure (zero resistance) coil of inductance L. As the current i in the coil grow continuously, an opposing emf is induced in the coil whose magnitude is \(\mathrm{L} \frac{d i}{d t}\) where \(\frac{d i}{d t}\)  is the rate of change of current. But this should be zero because there is no resistance in the current. Thus,

           Question 30.
           <br/>
           State the importance of coherent sources in the phenomenon of interference. In Young’s double slit experiment to produce interference pattern, obtain the conditions for constructive and destructive interference. Hence deduce the expression for the fringe width. How does the fringe width get affected, if the entire experimental apparatus of Young is immersed in water ? [5]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           Two sources of light which continuously emit light waves of same frequency with a zero or constant phase difference between them are called coherent sources. They are necessary to produce sustained interference pattern.
          </p>
<p>
           A thin film of oil spread over water shows beautiful colors due to interference of light. If coherent sources are not taken, the phase difference between the two interfering waves will change continuously and a sustained interference pattern will not be obtained.

<br/>
           Constructive interference: The intensity of light will be maximum at those places where the path difference between the interfering light waves is zero or an integral multiple of λ, i.e., λ , 2λ ,……….
           <br/>
           Hence for maximum intensity, we have

<br/>
           destructive interference.
           <br/>
           So fringe width is directly proportional to λ On immersing the apparatus in water, the wavelength of light decreases (λω = λ/n).
           <br/>
           Therefore, fringe width will decrease in water.

          </h3>
<p>
           Note : Except for the following questions, all the remaining questions have been asked in previous Set.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           A hollow metal sphere of radius 10 cm is charged such that the potential on its surface is 5 V. What is the potential at the centre of the sphere ? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           Potential inside the charged sphere is constant and equal to potential on the surface of conductor. Therefore, potential at the center of sphere is 5 V.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           How are X-rays produced ? 11]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           X-rays are produced when electron strike a metal target. The electrons are liberated from the heated filament and accelerated from the high voltage towards the metal target. X-rays are also produced when electrons collide with the atom and nuclei of metal target.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Where on the surface of Earth is the angle of dip zero ? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           At magnetic equator angle of dip is zero.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           State the principle of working of a transformer. Can a transformer be used to step up or step down a d.c. voltage ? Justify your answer. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           Transformer principle : It is a device which converts high voltage a.c. into low voltage a.c. and vice-versa.
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 Physics 2011 Outside Delhi 45" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-127745" height="162" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Physics-2011-Outside-Delhi-45.png" width="289"/>
<br/>
           It is based upon the principle of mutual induction. When alternating current is passed through a coil, an induced e.m.f. is set up in the neighboring coil.
          </p>
<p>
           Working: When an alternating current is passed through the primary, the magnetic flux through the iron core changes which does two things. It produces e.m.f. in the primary and an induced e.m.f. is also set up in the secondary. If we assume that the resistance of primary is negligible, the back e.m.f. will be equal to the voltage applied to the primary.
           <br/>

<br/>
           A transformer can not be used to step up or step down a d.c. voltage because d.c. can not produce a changing magnetic flux in the core of the transformer and no emf will be induced.

<p>
           Note : Except for the following questions, all the remaining questions have been asked in previous Set.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           A hollow metal sphere of radius 6 cm is charged such that the potential on its surface is 12 V. What is the potential at the centre of sphere ? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           Potential inside the charged sphere is constant and equal to potential on the surface of conductor. So therefore, potential at the centre of sphere is 12 V.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           How are microwaves produced ? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           Microwaves are electromagnetic waves with wavelength ranging from as long as meter to as short as one millimeter, or equivalently with frequencies between 300 MFz and 300 GHz. Microwaves are produced by vacuum tubes devices that operate on the ballistic motion of electron controlled by magnetic or electric fields. Some different kinds of microwaves emitters are the cavity magnetron, the klystron, the travelling wave tube (TWT), the gyrotron and all stars.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Mention various energy losses in transformer. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           Magnetic core losses are exaggerated with higher frequencies, eddy currents in the iron core, resistance of windings or copper loss, hysteresis loss and flux leakage are energy losses in transformers. Transformers energy losses tend to worsen with increasing frequency.
