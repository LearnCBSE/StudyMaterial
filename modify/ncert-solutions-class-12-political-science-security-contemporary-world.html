<span style="color: #339966;">
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
             Answer:
            </strong>
</span>
           The threats are different in the third world and first world peoples because their regions are changed, hence they face different security challenges.in the following manner:
           <br/>
           1. The newly independent countries faced the military conflicts even with their neighbouring states.
           <br/>
           2. These countries faced threats not only from outside their borders, mostly from neighbours, but also from within.
           <br/>
           3. Internally, new states worried about threats from separatist movements which wanted to form independent countries.
           <br/>
           4. Sometimes, the external and internal threats merged.
           <br/>
           5. For the new states, external wars with neighbours and internal wars posed a serious challenge to their security.
          </p>
<p>
<span style="color: #993366;">
<strong>
             5. Is terrorism a traditional or non- traditional threat to security?

<br/>
<span style="color: #339966;">
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
             Answer:
            </strong>
</span>
           Terrorism is a non-traditional threat to wound the peace and order in the country:
           <br/>
           1. Terrorism refers to political violence to target civilians deliberately and indiscriminately.
           <br/>
           2. Civilians are usually terrorised to be it as a weapon against national government and other parties in the conflict.
           <br/>
           3. Terrorism involves hijacking planes or planting bombs in trains, cafes, markets and other crowded places.
           <br/>
           4. After a terrorist attack on World Trade Centre on 11 September 2001, the other governments and public also are paying more attention to terrorism.

<strong>
             6. What are the choices available to a state when its security is threatened, according to traditional security perspective?
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #339966;">
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
             Answer:
            </strong>
</span>
           Traditional security perspective emphasises on compromises to limit the violence by giving following three choices to the state if its security is threatened:
           <br/>
           1. To surrender when actually confronted by war, but they will not advertise this as the policy of country.
           <br/>
           2. To prevent the other side from attacking by promising to raise the costs of war to an unacceptable level.
           <br/>
           3. To defend to protect itself when war actually breaks out so as to deny the attacking country its objectives and to turn back or to defeat the attacking forces altogether
           <br/>
           4. Hence, state’s security policy is to prevent war which is called deterrence and with limiting or heading war called defence.
          </p>

<strong>
             7. What is Balance of Power? How could a state achieve this?
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #339966;">
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
             Answer:
            </strong>
</span>
           ‘Balance of Power’ is a balance between bigger and smaller countries by cooperating with each other economically and technologically. A smaller country is always suspicious to break out a war from bigger or powerful country. Hence, they maintain a balance of power to build up one’s military power together with economic and technological power-to protect one’s own security.

<br/>
<span style="color: #339966;">
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
             Answer:
            </strong>
</span>
           Objectives:
           <br/>
           1. Alliance building is important component of traditional security to threats to deal between states and nations to deter or defend against military attacks.
           <br/>
           2. Alliances are formalised in written treaties and identification of who constitutes the threats.
           <br/>
           3. Alliances are formed to increase their effective power relative to another alliance.

</span>
           Yes, we agree with the statement because in some situations one country may have to disproportionately bear the brunt of a global problem i.e. environmental degradation causing a serious threat to security, for example, due to global warming, a sea level rise of 1.5-2.0 meters would flood 20% of Bangladesh, inundate most of Maldives and threaten nearly half the population of Thailand, Hence, international cooperation is vital due to global nature of these problems.

             Answer:
            </strong>
</span>
           Nuclear weapons have limited usage due to arms-control method of cooperation. One of the arms-control treaty was the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968 to regulate the acquisition of nuclear weapons. As per this treaty those countries that had fasted and manufactured nuclear weapons before 1967 were allowed to keep their weapons and those that had not done so were to give up the right to acquire them. The NPT did not abolish nuclear weapons rather it limited the number of countries that could have them.

             Answer:
            </strong>
</span>
           India has faced traditional (military) and non-traditional threats to its security that have emerged from within as well as outside its borders. Its security strategy has four broad components i e :
           <br/>
           1. To strengthen its military capabilities because:
           <br/>
           (a) India has been involved in conflict with its neighbours as Pakistan in 1947-48,1965,1971 and 1999 and China in 1962.
           <br/>
           (b) In South Asian Region, India is
           <br/>
           surrounded by nuclear armed countries. Hence India’s decision to conduct nuclear test in 1998 was justified to safeguard national security.
           <br/>
           (c) India first tested nuclear device in 1974.
           <br/>
           2. To strengthen international norms and international institutions:
           <br/>
           (a) India’s first Prime Minister J.L. Nehru supported Asian solidarity, disarmament, decolonisation and the UN as a forum to settle down international conflict.
           <br/>
           (b) India took initiatives to bring about a universal and non- discriminatory non-proliferation regime to enjoy some rights and obligations with respect to weapons of mass destruction.
           <br/>
           (c) It used non-alignment to help to carve out an area of peace outside the blocs.
           <br/>
           (d) India signed Kyoto Protocol in 1997 to be a part of roadmap for reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases to check global warming.
           <br/>
           3. To meet security challenges within the country:
           <br/>
           (a) Several militant groups from areas such as Nagaland, Mizoram, Punjab, Kashmir have sought to break away from India.
           <br/>
           (b) India makes efforts to preserve national unity by adopting a democratic political system by providing freedom of speech and expression alongwith the right to vote.
           <br/>
           4. To develop its economy:
           <br/>
           (a) India develops the way to lift vast mass of citizens out of poverty, misery and huge economic inequalities.
           <br/>
           (b) A democratically elected government is supposed to combine economic growth with human development without any demarcation between the rich and the poor.

             Answer:
            </strong>
</span>
           Four new sources of threats to security can be identified as follows:
           <br/>
           1. Terrorism is a war against democracy and a crime against humanity. It refers to political violence that targets civilians deliberately and discriminately to use it as a weapon against national government. It has become a global phenomena because even superpower is not free from terrorist attacks.
           <br/>
           2. Human rights are those basic conditions which an individual is supposed to enjoy as a human being. These rights include political rights, freedom of speech and expression, economic rights, social and civil rights and rights of indigenous people to lead as honourable and dignified life.
           <br/>
           3. Global poverty refers to low economic growth, low national income and low standard of living of developing or least developed countries.
           <br/>
           4. Health epidemics is a very serious threat to a country’s security because severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), HIV-AIDS, bird flue etc. diseases spread across countries through migration business, tourism and military operations.

<strong>
             Answer.:
            </strong>
</span>
           Global poverty refers to low economic growth, low national income and low standard of living of developing or least developed countries. It is a source of insecurity because:
           <br/>
           1. Half the world’s population growth occurs in just six countries- India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh and Indonesia, considered developing countries and even in poorest countries population is expected to triple in next 50 years.
           <br/>
           2. Globally, this disparity contributes to the gap between the northern and southern countries of the world.
           <br/>
           3. Poverty in south has also led a large migration to seek a better economic opportunities in the north.
           <br/>
           4. All these created international political friction as international law and norms make a distinction between migrants and refugees as they do not get ready to accept migrants.

             Answer:

</span>
           Disarmament requires all states to give up certain kinds of weapons i.e. the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) and 1992 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) banned the production and possession of these weapons. Despite the US and Soviet Union were not ready to give up the third type of weapons of mass-destruction namely nuclear weapons.

</span>
           The secure states are supposed to protect their people from individual in security also rather the territorial security only. Hence they are required to provide security from foreign attack hunger, diseases and natural disasters etc. because it destructs the people rather more than a war.

            The US and Soviet’Union signed a number of other arms control treaties including the Strategic Arms Limitations Treaty II (SALT II) and the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). The Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968 was an arms control treaty in the sense that it regulated the acquisition of nuclear weapons, those countries that had tested and manufactured nuclear weapons before 1967 were allowed to keep their weapons and those that had not done so were to give up the right to acquire them. The NPT did not abolish nuclear weapons; rather, it limited the number of countries that could have them.

            Global poverty is another source of insecurity. World population-now at 650 crore-will reach 700 to 800 crore within 25 years and many eventually level out at 900 to 1000 crore. Currently, half the world’s population growth occurs in just six countries — India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh and Indonesia. Among the world’s poorest countries, population is expected to triple in next 50 years whereas many rich countries will see population shrinkage in that period, high per capita income and low population growth make rich states or rich social groups get richer, whereas low incomes and high population growth reinforce each other to make poor states and poor groups get poorer. puui O ta tco CUJ.IL puux gi u upo get puui d.

<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
             Answer:
            </strong>
</span>
           At its most basic, security implies freedom from threats. Human existence and the life of a country are full of threats. We generally say that only those things that threaten ‘core values’ should be regarded as being of interest in discussions of security. Thus, security relates only to extremely dangerous threats — threats that could so endanger core values that those values would be damaged beyond repair if we did not do something to deal with the situation.
           <br/>
           India’s security strategy has four broad components which have been used in a varying combination from time to time: (i) The first component was strengthening its military capabilities because India has been involved in conflicts with its neighbours — Pakistan in 1947-48, 1965, 1971 and 1999 and China in 1962. Since it is surrounded by nuclear-armed countries in the South Asian region, India’s decision to conduct nuclear tests in 1998 was justified by the Indian government in terms of safeguarding national security.
           <br/>
           (ii) The second component of India’s
           <br/>
           security strategy has been to strengthen international norms and international institutions to protect its security interests.
           <br/>
           (iii) The third component of Indian security strategy is geared towards meeting security challenges within the country. Several militant groups from areas such as Nagaland, Mizoram, the Punjab and Kashmir among others have from time to time sought to break away from India. India has tried to preserve national unity by adopting a democratic political system.
           <br/>
           (iv) There has been an attempt in India to develop its economy in a way that the vast mass of citizens are lifted out of poverty and misery and huge economic inequalities are not allowed to exist.

           (ii) In South Asian Region, India is surrounded by nuclear armed countries. Hence, India’s decision to conduct nuclear test in 1990 was justified to safeguard national security.

           (iii) India’s first tested nuclear device in 1974.
           <br/>
           Though India has made efforts to develop its economy and an individual’s security from poverty but still it is lagging behind even now and we are supposed to make more efforts.

</span>
           India has faced traditional military and non-traditional threats to its security that have emerged from within as well as outside its borders. Its security strategy has four broad components i.e.:
           <br/>
           1. To Strengthen its Military Capa¬bilities:
           <br/>
           Because:
           <br/>
           (a) India has been involved in conflict with its neighbours, as Pakistan in 1947-48,1965,1971 and 1999 and China in 1962.
           <br/>
           (b) In South Asian Region, India is surrounded by nuclear armed countries. Hence, India’s decision to conduct nuclear test in 1990 was justified to safeguard national security.
           <br/>
           (c) India first tested nuclear device in 1974.
           <br/>
           2. To Strengthen International Norms and International Institu¬tions:
           <br/>
           (a) India’s first Prime Minister J.L. Nehru supported Asian solidarity, disarmament, decolonisation and the UN as a forum to settle down international conflict.
           <br/>
           (b) India took initiatives to bring about a universal and non- discriminatory non-proliferation regime to enjoy same rights and obligations with respect to weapons of mass destruction.
           <br/>
           (c) It used non-alignment to help to carve out an area of place outside the blocs.
           <br/>
           (d) India signed Kyoto Protocol in 1997 to be a part of roadmap for reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases to check global warming.
           <br/>
           3. To Meet Security Challenges
           <br/>
           within the Country:
           <br/>
           (a) Several militant groups from areas such as Nagaland, Mizoram, Punjab, Kashmir have sought to break away from India.
           <br/>
           (b) India makes efforts to preserve national unity by adopting a democratic political system by providing freedom of speech and expression alongwith the right to vote.
           <br/>
           4. To Develop its Economy:
           <br/>
           (a) India develops the way to lift vast mass of citizens out of poverty, misery and huge economic inequalities.
           <br/>
           (b) A democratically elected government is supposed to combine economic growth with human development without any demarcation between the rich and the poor.

</span>
           Non-traditional concept of security includes human and global security covering a wide range of threats affecting human existence:
           <br/>
           1. It does not cover only the states but
           <br/>
           also the individuals and communities also.
           <br/>
           2. It emphasises on security on nature of threat and right approach to deal with the threat.
           <br/>
           Its sources can be identified as follows:
           <br/>
           1. Terrorism refers to political violence to target civilians deliberately and discriminately to use it as a weapon against national government.
           <br/>
           2. Human Rights refer to basic conditions which an individual is supposed to enjoy as a human being as political rights, freedom of speech and expression, economic rights, social and civil rights to lead an honourable and dignified life.
           <br/>
           3. Global poverty refers to low economic growth, low national income and low standard of living of developing or least developed countries.
           <br/>
           4. Health epidemics is a very serious threat to country’s security because severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (ARS), HIV-AIDS, bird flue diseases spread across countries through migration, business, tourism and military operations.

</span>
           Arms control regulates the acquisition or development of weapons by adopting following measures:
           <br/>
           1. The Anti Ballistic Missiles Treaty in 1992 stopped the US and Soviet Union from using ballistic missiles to limit large scale production.
           <br/>
           2. Other arms control treaties were also signed i.e. Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty and Nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) to limit the weapons which many bring large scale destruction.
           <br/>
           3. NPT regulated the acquisition of nuclear weapons in 1968.
           <br/>
           4. NPT did not abolish nuclear weapons rather it limited number of countries that could have them.
