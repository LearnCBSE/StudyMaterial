<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           An electron and alpha particle have the same de-Broglie wavelength associated with them. How are their kinetic energies related to each other?
           <br/>
           (Delhi 2008)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
<img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 13 Nuclei Class 12 Important Questions 1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-114115" height="366" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-13-Nuclei-Class-12-Important-Questions-1.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-13-Nuclei-Class-12-Important-Questions-1.png 381w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-13-Nuclei-Class-12-Important-Questions-1-300x288.png 300w" width="381"/>

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           State the reason, why heavy water is generally used as a moderator in a nuclear reactor. (Delhi 2008)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Neutrons produced during fission get slowed if they collide with a nucleus of the same mass. As ordinary water contains hydrogen atoms (of mass nearly that of neutrons), so it can be used as a moderator. But it absorbs neutrons at a fast rate via reaction :
           <br/>
<img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 13 Nuclei Class 12 Important Questions 2" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-114116" height="22" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 156px) 100vw, 156px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-13-Nuclei-Class-12-Important-Questions-2.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-13-Nuclei-Class-12-Important-Questions-2.png 156w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-13-Nuclei-Class-12-Important-Questions-2-150x22.png 150w" width="156"/>
<br/>
           Here d is deutron. To overcome this difficulty, heavy water is used as a moderator which has negligible cross-section for neutron absorption.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Name the absorbing material used to control the reaction rate of neutrons in a nuclear reactor. (Delhi 2008)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Control rod or cadmium rod.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Nuclear forces are the strongest force in nature.
           <br/>
           (ii) They are saturated forces.
           <br/>
           (iii) They are charge independent.

           Two nuclei have mass numbers in the ratio 1: 2. What is the ratio of their nuclear densities? (Delhi 2009)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
<img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 13 Nuclei Class 12 Important Questions 3" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-114117" height="256" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-13-Nuclei-Class-12-Important-Questions-3.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-13-Nuclei-Class-12-Important-Questions-3.png 382w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-13-Nuclei-Class-12-Important-Questions-3-300x201.png 300w" width="382"/>

           Question 6.
           <br/>
           Two nuclei have mass number in the ratio 1 : 3. What is the ratio of their nuclear densities? (Delhi 2009)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Since nuclear density is independent of the mass number, the ratio of nuclear densities will be 1:1.

           Question 7.
           <br/>
           Two nuclei have mass numbers in the ratio 2 : 5. What is the ratio of their nuclear densities? (Delhi 2009)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Nuclear density is independent of mass number, so the ratio will be 1 : 1.

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           State the reason, why heavy water is generally used as a moderator in a nuclear reactor. (Delhi 2008)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Neutrons produced during fission get slowed if they collide with a nucleus of the same mass. As ordinary water contains hydrogen atoms (of mass nearly that of neutrons), so it can be used as a moderator. But it absorbs neutrons at a fast rate via reaction :

<br/>
           Here d is deutron. To overcome this difficulty, heavy water is used as a moderator which has negligible cross-section for neutron absorption.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           It is found experimentally difficult to detect neutrinos in nuclear P-decay, because of two reasons :
           <br/>
           (i) mass of neutrino is extremely small;
           <br/>
           (ii) its charge is negligibly small.

           Question 22.
           <br/>
           (a) The mass of a nucleus in its ground state is always less than the total mass of its constituents – neutrons and protons. Explain.
           <br/>
           (b) Plot a graph showing the variation of potential energy of a pair of nucleons as a function of their separation. (All India 2016)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) When nucleons approach each other to form a nucleus, they strongly attract each other. Their potential energy decreases and becomes negative. It is this potential energy which holds the nucleons together in the nucleus. The decrease in’ potential energy results in the decrease in the mass of the nucleons inside the nucleus.

           Question 23.
           <br/>
           A heavy nucleus X of mass number 240 and binding energy per nucleon 7.6 MeV is split into two fragments Y and Z of mass numbers 110 and 130. The binding energy of nucleons in Y and Z is 8.5 MeV per nucleon. Calculate the energy Q released per fission in MeV. (Delhi 2016)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
<img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 13 Nuclei Class 12 Important Questions 25" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-114139" height="21" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-13-Nuclei-Class-12-Important-Questions-25.png" width="208"/>
<br/>
           ∴ Gain in binding energy for nucleon = 8.5 – 7.6 = 0.9 MeV
           <br/>
           Hence total gain in binding energy per nucleus fission = 240 × 0.9 = 216 MeV
          </p>
<p>
           Question 24.
           <br/>
           Draw a plot of potential energy of a pair of nucleons as a function of their separation. Write two important conclusions which you can draw regarding the nature of nuclear forces. (All India 2016)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Two important conclusions :
           <br/>
           (i) Nuclear force between two nucleons falls rapidly to zero as their distance is more than a few femtometres. This explains constancy of the binding energy per nucleon for large-size nucleus.
           <br/>
<img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 13 Nuclei Class 12 Important Questions 26" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-114140" height="189" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-13-Nuclei-Class-12-Important-Questions-26.png" width="231"/>
<br/>
           (ii) Graph explains that force is attractive for distances larger than 0.8 fin and repulsive for distances less than 0.8 fm.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 25.
           <br/>
           Draw a plot of the binding energy per nucleon as a function of mass number for a large number of nuclei, 2 ≤ A ≤ 240. How do you explain the constancy of binding energy per nucleon in the range 30 &lt; A &lt; 170 using the property that nuclear force is short-ranged? (All India 2016)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) The constancy of the binding energy in the range 30 &lt; A &lt; 170 is a consequence of the fact that the nuclear force is short ranged.
           <br/>
           If a nucleon can have a maximum of p neighbours within the range of nuclear force, its binding energy would be proportional to p. Since most of the nucleons in a large nucleus reside inside it and not on the surface, the change in binding energy per nucleon would be small. The binding energy per nucleon is a constant and is approximately equal to pk. The property that a given nucleon influences only nucleons close to it, is referred to as saturation property of the nuclear force.

<img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 13 Nuclei Class 12 Important Questions 27" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-114141" height="181" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-13-Nuclei-Class-12-Important-Questions-27.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-13-Nuclei-Class-12-Important-Questions-27.png 325w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-13-Nuclei-Class-12-Important-Questions-27-300x167.png 300w" width="325"/>
</p>
<p>
           (b) Nuclear force is short-ranged for a sufficiently large nucleus. A nucleon is under the influence of only some of its neighbours, which come within the range of the nuclear force. If a nucleon can have maximum of P neighbours within the range of nuclear force, its binding energy would be proportional to ‘P’ Thus on increasing ‘A’ by adding nucleons binding energy will remain constant.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 26.
           <br/>
           Using the curve for the binding energy per nucleon as a function of mass number A, state clearly how the release of energy in the processes of nuclear fission and nuclear fusion can be explained. (All India 2011)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           1. Nuclear fission : Binding energy per nucleon is smaller for heavier nuclei than the middle ones i.e. heavier nuclei are less stable. When a heavier nucleus splits into the lighter nuclei, the B.E./nucleon changes (increases) from about 7.6 MeV to 8.4 MeV. Greater binding energy of the product nuclei results in the liberation of energy. This is what happens in nuclear fission which is the basis of the atom bomb.
           <br/>
<img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 13 Nuclei Class 12 Important Questions 40" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-114154" height="174" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-13-Nuclei-Class-12-Important-Questions-40.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-13-Nuclei-Class-12-Important-Questions-40.png 320w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-13-Nuclei-Class-12-Important-Questions-40-300x163.png 300w" width="320"/>
<br/>
           2. Nuclear fusion : The binding energy per nucleon is small for light nuclei, i.e., they are less stable. So when two light nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, the higher binding energy per nucleon of the latter results in the release of energy.

           Question 28.
           <br/>
           If both the number of protons and neutrons in a nuclear reaction is conserved, in what way is mass converted into energy (or vice verse)? Explain giving one example. (Comptt. Delhi 2011)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Explanation for release of energy in a nuclear reaction : Since proton number and neutron number are conserved in a nuclear reaction, the total rest mass of neutrons and protons is the same on either side of the nuclear reaction.
           <br/>
           But total binding energy of nuclei on the left side need not be the same as that on the right hand side. The difference in binding energy causes a release of energy in the reaction.

           Question 31.
           <br/>
           If both the number of protons and the number of neutrons are conserved in each nuclear reaction, in what way is mass converted into energy (or vice-versa) in a nuclear reaction? Explain. (Comptt. All India 2016)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The number of protons and neutrons in a nuclear reaction are conserved but the total mass is not conserved.
           <br/>
           The total mass of the free protons and neutrons is more than their total mass within the nucleus. The lost mass (= ∆m) known as ‘mass defect’, gets converted into energy as per the relation E = (∆m)c

           (b) Draw a plot of potential energy of a pair of nucleons as a function of their separation. (Comptt. All India 2017)

           Answer:
          </p>
<p>
           (a) Nuclear forces. The strong forces of attraction which hold together the nucleons (neutrons and protons) in the tiny nucleus of an atom are called nuclear forces.
           <br/>
           Important properties (characteristics):
           <br/>
           1. Nuclear forces are independent of charge (These act between a pair of neutrons, between a pair of protons and between a proton and a neutron).
           <br/>
           2. Nuclear forces are the strongest forces in nature.
           <br/>
           3. Nuclear forces are very short range forces.
           <br/>
           4. Nuclear forces are non-central forces.
           <br/>
           5. Nuclear forces are dependent on spin.
          </p>

           (b) A plot of the potential energy between two nucleons as a function of distance is shown in the diagram.

<br/>
           Important conclusions from the graph :
           <br/>
           (i) The nuclear force is much stronger than the Coulomb force acting between charges or the gravitational forces between masses. The nuclear binding force has to dominate over the Coulomb repulsive force between protons inside the nucleus. This happens only because the nuclear force is much stronger than the coulomb force. The gravitational force is much weaker than even Coulomb force.
           <br/>
           (ii) The nuclear force between two nucleons falls rapidly to zero as their distance is more than a few femtometers. This leads to saturation of forces in a medium or a large-sized nucleus, which is the reason for the constancy of the binding energy per nucleon.
           <br/>
           (iii) The nuclear force between neutron- neutron, proton-neutron and proton-proton is approximately the same. The nuclear force does not depend on the electric charge.

           Distinguish between nuclear fission and fusion. Explain how the energy is released in both the processes. (Comptt. All India 2017)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In nuclear fission a heavy nucleus breaks up into smaller nuclei accompanied by release of energy; whereas in nuclear fusion two light nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus accompanied by release of energy.
           <br/>
           In both the cases, some mass (= mass defect) gets converted into energy as per the relation :

           <br/>
           Draw a plot showing the variation of binding energy per nucleon versus the mass number (A). Explain with the help of this plot the release of energy in the processes of nuclear fission and fusion. (All India 2009)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           1. Nuclear fission : Binding energy per nucleon is smaller for heavier nuclei than the middle ones i.e. heavier nuclei are less stable. When a heavier nucleus splits into the lighter nuclei, the B.E./nucleon changes (increases) from about 7.6 MeV to 8.4 MeV. Greater binding energy of the product nuclei results in the liberation of energy. This is what happens in nuclear fission which is the basis of the atom bomb.

<p>
           2. Nuclear fusion : The binding energy per nucleon is small for light nuclei, i.e., they are less stable. So when two light nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, the higher binding energy per nucleon of the latter results in the release of energy.

           Question 43.
           <br/>
           Answer the following, giving reasons:
           <br/>
           (i) Why is the binding energy per nucleon found to be constant for nuclei in the range of mass number (A) lying between 30 and 170?
           <br/>
           (ii) When a heavy nucleus with mass number A = 240 breaks into two nuclei, A = 120, energy is released in’ the process.
           <br/>
           (iii) In β-decay, the experimental detection of neutrinos (or antineutrinos) is found to be extremely difficult. (Comptt. All India 2011)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Nuclear forces are short ranged. For a particular nucleon inside a sufficiently large nucleus will be under the influence of some of its neighbours which come within the range of the nuclear force. The property that a given nucleon influences only nucleons close to it is also referred to as saturation property of the nuclear force.
           <br/>
           (ii) The binding energy per nucleon of the parent nucleus is less than those of the two daughter nuclei. It is this increased binding energy that gets released in this process.
           <br/>
           (iii) Neutrinos are chargeless and massless particles, whose interaction with other particles is almost negligible. Hence, they can pass through very large quantity of matter with-out getting detected.

<img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 13 Nuclei Class 12 Important Questions 49" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-114163" height="29" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-13-Nuclei-Class-12-Important-Questions-49.png" width="260"/>
<br/>
           although number of nucleons is conserved, yet energy is released. How? Explain.
           <br/>
           (b) Show that nuclear density in a given nucleus is independent of mass number A. (Delhi 2011)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) In all types of nuclear reactions, the law of conservation of number of nucleons is followed. But during the reaction, the mass of the final product is found to be slightly less than the sum of the masses of the reactant components. This difference in mass of a nucleus and its constituents is called mass defect. So, as per mass energy relation E = (∆M)c
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
           , energy is released. In the given reaction the sum of the masses of two deutrons is more than the mass of helium and neutron. Energy equivalent of mass defect is released.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Radioactive decay law. It states that “the number of atoms disintegrated per second at any instant is directly proportional to the number of radioactive atoms actually present at that time.” Let N
           <sub>
            0
           </sub>
           be the total number of atoms present at time t = 0 (initially)
           <br/>
           and N be the total number of atoms present at time t, then
           <br/>
           According to radioactive decay law, the rate of disintegration at any time t is directly proportional to the number of atoms present at that time t.

           Question 53.
           <br/>
           (a) Write three characteristic properties of nuclear force.
           <br/>
           (b) Draw a plot of potential energy of a pair of nucleons as a function of their separation. Write two important conclusions that can be drawn from the graph. (All India 2015)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Nuclear forces. The strong forces of attraction which hold together the nucleons (neutrons and protons) in the tiny nucleus of an atom are called nuclear forces.
           <br/>
           Important properties (characteristics):
           <br/>
           1. Nuclear forces are independent of charge (These act between a pair of neutrons, between a pair of protons and between a proton and a neutron).
           <br/>
           2. Nuclear forces are the strongest forces in nature.
           <br/>
           3. Nuclear forces are very short range forces.
           <br/>
           4. Nuclear forces are non-central forces.
           <br/>
           5. Nuclear forces are dependent on spin.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) A plot of the potential energy between two nucleons as a function of distance is shown in the diagram.
           <br/>

<br/>
           Important conclusions from the graph :
           <br/>
           (i) The nuclear force is much stronger than the Coulomb force acting between charges or the gravitational forces between masses. The nuclear binding force has to dominate over the Coulomb repulsive force between protons inside the nucleus. This happens only because the nuclear force is much stronger than the coulomb force. The gravitational force is much weaker than even Coulomb force.
           <br/>
           (ii) The nuclear force between two nucleons falls rapidly to zero as their distance is more than a few femtometers. This leads to saturation of forces in a medium or a large-sized nucleus, which is the reason for the constancy of the binding energy per nucleon.
           <br/>
           (iii) The nuclear force between neutron- neutron, proton-neutron and proton-proton is approximately the same. The nuclear force does not depend on the electric charge.
          </p>

           It is found experimentally difficult to detect neutrinos in nuclear P-decay, because of two reasons :
           <br/>
           (i) mass of neutrino is extremely small;
           <br/>
           (ii) its charge is negligibly small.
           <br/>
           Also, neutrinos interact very weakly with matter.

           Question 56.
           <br/>
           Obtain the relation \(\mathbf{N}=\mathbf{N}_{0} e^{-\lambda t}\) for a sample of radioactive material having decay constant λ, where N is the number of nuclei present at constant λ. Hence obtain the relation between decay constant λ and half life \(\mathbf{T}_{\frac{1}{2}}\) of the sample. (Comptt. Delhi 2017)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i)
           <br/>
           (a) Radioactive decay law. It states that “the number of atoms disintegrated per second at any instant is directly proportional to the number of radioactive atoms actually present at that time.” Let N0 be the total number of atoms present at time t = 0 (initially)
           <br/>
           and N be the total number of atoms present at time t, then
           <br/>
           According to radioactive decay law, the rate of disintegration at any time t is directly proportional to the number of atoms present at that time t.
