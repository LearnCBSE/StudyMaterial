           (i) Calculation of Goodwill of the Firm
           <br/>
           Average profits = \(\frac{4,00,000+4,80,000+7,33,000-33,000+2,20,000}{5} = \frac{18,00,000}{5}\)
           <br/>
           = ₹ 3,60,000
           <br/>
           Goodwill = Average Profits  x  Number of Years’ Purchase = 3,60,000 x 2 = ₹ 7,20,000

           Question 18.
           <br/>
           Rashid and Komal are partners in a firm. Their capitals are: Rashid ₹ 30,000 and Komal ₹ 20,000. During the year ended 31st March, 2020, the firm earned a profit of ₹ 15,000. Assuming that the normal rate of return is 20%, calculate the value of goodwill of the firm of Rashid and Komal.
           <br/>
           (i) By capitalisation method; and
           <br/>
           (ii) By super profit method, if the goodwill is valued at 4 years’ purchase of super profit.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Capitalisation Method
           <br/>
           Total Capitalised Value of the Firm = \(\frac{\text { Average Profit } \times 100}{\text { Normal Rate of Return }}=\frac{15,000 \times 100}{20}\) = ₹ 75,000
          </p>
<p>
           Goodwill of the Firm = Total Capitalised Value of Business – Capital Employed
           <br/>
           = 75,000-50,000[ i.e., 30,000 (Rashid) +20,000 (Komal) ]= ₹ 25,000
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Super Profit Method
           <br/>
           Normal Profit = Capital Employed x Normal Rate of Return / 100 = 50,000 x \(\frac{20}{100}\) = ₹ 10,000
           <br/>
           Average Profit = ₹ 15,000
           <br/>
           Super Profit = Average Profit – Normal Profit = 15,000-10,000 = ₹ 5,000
           <br/>
           Goodwill of the Firm = Super Profit x Number of Years’ Purchase = 5,000 x 4 = ₹ 20,000

           1. Calculation of Interest on Capital
           <br/>
           A On 2,00,000=2,00,000 x \(\frac{6}{100}\) =₹ 12,000 ; On 50,000=50,000 x \(\frac{6}{100}\) x \(\frac{6}{12}\) = ₹ 1,500
           <br/>
           Total interest on A’s capital =12,000+1,500=₹ 13,500
           <br/>
           B On 1,00,000=1,00,000 x \(\frac{6}{100}\) = ₹ 6,000 ; On 20,000=20,000 x \(\frac{6}{100}\)  x \(\frac{3}{12}\) = ₹ 300
           <br/>
           Total interest on B’s capital =6,000+300=₹ 6,300

           Answer:
           <br/>
           Any two ratios
           <br/>
           (i) Debt to Equity Ratio = \(\frac{\text { Debt }^{\star}}{\text { Equity or Shareholders’ Funds }{ }^{\star}}=\frac{10,000}{35,000}\) = 0.286: 1
          </p>
<p>
           Debts =9 % Debentures = ₹ 10,000
           <br/>
           Shareholders’ Funds = Equity Share Capital + General Reserve + Balance of Statement of Profit and Loss
           <br/>
           = 25,000+2,500+7,500 = ₹ 35,000

<p>
           (ii) Working Capital Turnover Ratio = \(\frac{\text { Revenue from Operations (Net sales) }}{\text { Working Capital }^{\star}}=\frac{50,000}{2,500}\) = 20 times
           <br/>
           Working Capital = Current Assets – Current Liabilities =10,000-7,500=₹ 2,500
           <br/>
           Current Assets = Cash + Debtors =2,750+7,250=₹ 10,000
           <br/>
           Current Liabilities = Creditors =₹ 7,500

<br/>
           Profit before Interest and Tax =15,000+900 (Interest on Debentures) = ₹ 15,900
           <br/>
           **Capital Employed = Equity Share Capital + General Reserve + Balance of Statement of Profit and Loss
           <br/>
           =25,000+2,500+7,500+10,000=₹ 45,000 +9% Debentures.
