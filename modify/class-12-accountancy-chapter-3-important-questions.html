<p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Atul and Neera were partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio of 3 : 2. They admitted Mitali as a new partner. Goodwill of the firm was valued at â‚¹ 2,00,000. Mitali brings her share of goodwill premium of â‚¹ 20,000 in cash, which is entirely credited to Atulâ€™s capital account. Calculate the new profit sharing ratio. (Delhi 2019)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Firms goodwill = â‚¹ 2,00,000
           <br/>
           Premium for goodwill brought in by new partner Mitali = â‚¹ 20000
           <br/>
           So, Mitali s share = \(\frac { 20000 }{ 200000 }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ 10 }\)
           <br/>
           Premium for goodwill is entirely credited to Atulâ€™s capital account means only Atul sacrifice.
           <br/>
           So, Aridâ€™s sacrificing ratio = \(\frac { 1 }{ 10 }\)
           <br/>
           âˆ´ Atuls new share = \(\frac{3}{5}-\frac{1}{10}=\frac{6-1}{10}=\frac{5}{10}\)
           <br/>
           Neeraâ€™s new share = \(\frac{2}{5} \times \frac{2}{2}=\frac{4}{10}\)
           <br/>
           Mitaliâ€™s new share = \(\frac { 1 }{ 10 }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ 10 }\)
           <br/>
           New Ratio = 5 : 4 : 1

Chaman acquired \(\frac { 2 }{ 5 }\)th of his share from Amit. How much share did Chaman acquire from Beena? (CBSE 2018)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Chamanâ€™s share = \(\frac { 1 }{ 6 }\)
           <br/>
           Share acquired from Amit = \(\frac{2}{5} \times \frac{1}{6}=\frac{2}{30}\)
           <br/>
           Share acquired from Beena = Chamanâ€™s share â€“ Share acquired from Amit
           <br/>
           Share acquired from Beena = \(\frac{1}{6}-\frac{2}{30}=\frac{5-2}{30}=\frac{3}{30}\)

<p>
           (ii) Old ratio between Anita and Sunita = 3 : 2
           <br/>
           Vinita is admitted for \(\frac { 1 }{ 4}\)th share.

           Tanu is admitted for \(\frac { 1 }{ 5}\) th share
           <br/>
           Tanu acquired profit share from Sahil = \(\frac{1}{5} \times \frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{10}\)

           Question 22.
           <br/>
           Vinay and Naman are partners sharing profit in the ratio of 4 : 1. Their capitals were â‚¹ 90,000 and â‚¹ 70,000 respectively. They admitted Prateek for 1/3 share in the profits. Prateek brought â‚¹ 1,00,000 as his capital. Calculate the value of firmâ€™s goodwill. Compartment 2tn8
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Prateekâ€™s Capital for â€“ share = â‚¹ 1,00,000
           <br/>
           Firmâ€™s Total Capital = 1,00,000 Ã— 3 = â‚¹ 3,00,000
           <br/>
           On the basis of Prateekâ€™s Capital,
           <br/>
           Firm Actual Capital = 90000 + 70000 + 100000 = â‚¹ 2,60,000
           <br/>
           Firmâ€™s goodwill = 300000 â€“ 2,60000 = â‚¹ 40,000
          </p>
<p>
           Question 23.
           <br/>
           A, B, C and D were partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio of 4 : 3 : 2 : 1. On 1st January, 2015, they admitted E as a new partner for \(\frac { 1 }{ 10 }\)th share in the profits. E brought â‚¹ 10,000 for his share of goodwill premium which was correctly recorded in the books by the accountant. The accountant showed goodwill at â‚¹ 1,00,000 in the books. Was the accountant correct in doing so? Give reason in support of your answer. (Delhi 2015)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           No, the accountant is not correct because according to AS-26, internally generated goodwill shall not be recognised as an asset because it is not an identifiable resource controlled by the entity that can be measured reliably at cost.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 24.
           <br/>
           When the new partner brings cash for goodwill, the amount is credited to which account? (Delhi (C) 2015)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When the new partner brings cash for goodwill, the amount is credited to premium for goodwill account.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 25.
           <br/>
           Under what circumstances will the premium for goodwill paid by the incoming partner not be recorded in the books of accounts? (Delhi (C) 2014)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When the incoming partner pays his share of goodwill privately to the sacrificing partners, outside the business, then no entry is passed in the books of the firm.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 26.
           <br/>
           State the need for treatment of goodwill on admission of a partner. (Delhi 2010)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When a new partner is admitted, his share in future profits of the firm is equal to the sacrifice of profit by an existing partner or partners of the firm. The amount he pays to compensate this sacrifice, is in the form of goodwill. Therefore, it is important to treat goodwill at the time of admission of a partner.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 27.
           <br/>
           A, B, C and D were partners in a firm sharing profits and losses equally. E was admitted as a new partner for \(\frac { 1 }{ 3 }\)rd share in the profits of the firm which he acquires equally from C and 3 D. On Eâ€™s admission the goodwill of the firm was valued at â‚¹ 3,00,000. Calculate the new profit sharing ratio on Eâ€™s admission. Also pass necessary journal entry on Eâ€™s admission, assuming that he failed to bring his share of goodwill in cash. (All India 2019)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>

           The normal rate of return is 12% per annum. Average profit of the firm for the last four years was â‚¹ 30,000. Calculate Saurabhâ€™s share of goodwill. (comportment 2018)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Capital Employed = Amitâ€™s Capital + Kartikâ€™s Capital + Reserve = 90000 + 50000 + 20000 = â‚¹ 1,60,000
           <br/>
           2 12 f Normal Profit = Capital Employed x Normal Rate of Return = 100000 Ã— \(\frac { 12 }{ 100 }\) = â‚¹ 19,200
           <br/>
           Average Profit = â‚¹ 30,000
           <br/>
           Super Profit = Average Profit â€“ Normal Profit = 30000 â€“ 19200 = â‚¹ 10,800
           <br/>
           Firms Goodwill = Super Profit x Number of Years Purchase = 10000 x 4 = â‚¹ 43,200
           <br/>
           Saurabhâ€™s Share of Goodwill = 43200 x \(\frac { 1 }{ 3 }\) = â‚¹ 14,400

           <br/>
           Calculation of Sacrificing Ratio
           <br/>
           Sacrificing Ratio = Old Share â€“ New Share
           <br/>
           Anu = \(\frac{3}{4}-\frac{2}{5}=\frac{15-8}{20}=\frac{7}{20}\)
           <br/>
           Bhagwan = \(\frac{1}{4}-\frac{2}{5}=\frac{5-8}{20}=\left(\frac{3}{20}\right)\) gain
           <br/>
           Since Bhagwan is gaining, he will also compensate Anu proportionately.
           <br/>
           Bhagwan will compensate = 2,50,000 Ã— \(\frac { 3 }{ 20 }\) = â‚¹ 37,500

           1. Calculation of Ajayâ€™s Share of Goodwill
           <br/>
           (a) New firmâ€™s capital on the basis of Ajayâ€™s capital and his profit share = 5,00,000 x \(\frac { 5 }{ 1 }\) = â‚¹ 25,00,000

<p>
           Value of hidden goodwill (a â€“ b) = 25,00,000 â€“ 15,00,000 = â‚¹ 10,00,000
           <br/>
           Ajayâ€™s share = 10,00,000 x \(\frac { 1 }{ 5 }\) = â‚¹ 2,00,000
