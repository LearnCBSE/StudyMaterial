            Harmony of Objectives
           </strong>
           Most of the time it happens that the organisational objectives and individual objectives move in opposite directions. The person in charge of a team of workers should guide and instruct his team in such a manner that they realise the importance of both the objectives.
           <br/>
           (iii)
           <strong>
            Unity of Command
           </strong>
           This principle insists that a person in the organisation should receive instructions from one superior only. If instructions are received from more than one, it creates confusion, conflict and disorder in the organisation. Adherence to this principle ensures effective direction.
           <br/>
           (iv)
           <strong>
            Appropriateness of Direction Technique
           </strong>
           According to this principle, appropriate motivational and leadership technique should be used while directing the people based on subordinate needs, capabilities, attitudes
           <br/>
           etc, e.g., combination of both monetary and non-monetary incentives should be used to elicit the right response from the employees.
           <br/>
           (v)
           <strong>
            Managerial Communication
           </strong>
           Directing should convey clear instructions to create total understanding to subordinates. Through proper feed back the manager should ensure that subordinate understands his instructions clearly.
           <br/>
           (vi)
           <strong>
            Use of Informal Organisation
           </strong>
           Informal groups or organisations exist within every formal organisation and every manager should spot and make use of such organisations for effective directing.
           <br/>
           (vii)
           <strong>
            Leadership
           </strong>
           While directing the subordinates managers should exercise good leadership as it can influence the subordinates positively without causing dissatisfaction among them.
           <br/>
           (viii)
           <strong>
            Follow Through
           </strong>
           Mere giving of an order is not sufficient. Managers should follow it up by reviewing continuously whether orders are being implemented accordingly or any problems are being faced by the subordinates.
          </p>

           <br/>
           (v)
           <strong>

           <strong>
            Self Confidence
           </strong>
           A high level of self confidence is very important for any leader. He should not loose his confidence even in most difficult times. A person who is not himself confident will never be successful in providing confidence to his followers.

           </strong>
           A leader should be sociable and friendly with his colleagues and followers. He should understand people and maintain good human relations with them.
           <br/>
           Many times, the success of an organisation is attributed to the leader, but due credit is not given to the followers. Many followers related factors like their skills, knowledge, commitment, willingness to co-operate team spirit etc make a person an effective leader. It is said that followers make a person, a good leader by acceptance of leadership. Therefore both followers and leaders are playing an vital role in leadership process.

            Ans:
           </strong>
           Maslow’s need Hierarchy Theory of Motivation Motivation is a psychological term and the needs of an employee plays an important role in motivation. In order to study motivation various researchers developed theories on them. Among them Abraham Maslow’s need Hierarchy theory is considered of worth.

           <strong>
            Basic Physiological Needs
           </strong>
           These needs are most basic in the hierarchy and corresponds to primary needs. Food, clothing shelter are a few examples of this type of need. Basic salary helps to fulfill these needs.

            4. What are the common barriers to effective communication suggest measures to overcome them?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans:
           </strong>
           Common Barriers to Effective Communication Managers in all organisations face problems due to communication barriers. These barriers may prevent a communication or filter part of it or carry incorrect meaning due to which misunderstanding may be created. Therefore all managers should take some steps to overcome these barriers.
           <br/>
           There are broadly four groups of barriers
           <br/>
           (i)
           <strong>
            Semantic Barriers
           </strong>
           Semantic barriers are concerned with problems and obstructions in the process of encoding and decoding of message into words or impressions. Normally, such barriers result on account of use of wrong words, faulty translations, different interpretations etc. These are discussed below
           <br/>
           (a)
           <strong>
            Badly Expressed Message
           </strong>
           Sometimes the message is not communicated correctly by the manager because of inadequate vocabulary, usage of wrong words, omission of needed words etc.
           <br/>
           (b)
           <strong>
            Symbols with Different Meaning
           </strong>
           A word may have several meanings. Receiver has to perceive one such meaning for the word used by communicator.
           <br/>
           (c)
           <strong>
            Faulty Translations
           </strong>
           Sometimes while translating if incorrect translation is done due to poor command over both the languages then meaning of the message changes. This leads to cause different meanings to the communications.
           <br/>
           (d)
           <strong>
            Unclarified Assumptions
           </strong>
           Sometimes communication may have certain assumptions which are subject to different interpretations The one should always clear the meaning of what he is instructing the worker to do, so that the worker has no doubts in his mind.
           <br/>
           (e)
           <strong>
            Technical Jargon
           </strong>
           Sometimes specialists may use technical words in their communication by which the receiver is not aware.
           <br/>
           Therefore, they may not understand the complete conversation.
           <br/>
           (f)
           <strong>
            Body Language and Gesture Decoding
           </strong>
           The body movement and body gestures plays an important role in conveying the message.
           <br/>
           If there is no match between what is said and what is expressed in body movements, communications may be wrongly perceived.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii)
           <strong>
            Psychological Barriers
           </strong>
<br/>
           Emotional or psychological factors acts as barrier to communications e.g., a person who is worried cannot understand what is being told. Some of the psychological barriers are
           <br/>
           (a)
           <strong>
            Premature Evaluation
           </strong>
           Sometimes people evaluate the meaning of message before the sender completes his message. Such premature evaluation may be due to pre-conceived notions.
           <br/>
           (b)
           <strong>
            Lack of Attention
           </strong>
           If the mind is pre-occupied then the result is non-listening of message by receiver act as a major psychological barrier.
           <br/>
           (c)
           <strong>
            Lon by Transmission and Poor Retention
           </strong>
           When message passes through various levels, successive transmission of message results in loss of information. It happenes mostly with oral communication. Also people cannot retain the information for a long time if they are inattentive or not interested.
           <br/>
           (d)
           <strong>
            Distrust
           </strong>
           If the communicator and communicatee do not believe on each other, they can not understand each others message in its original sense as they are not giving importance to the information exchanged.

           (iii)
           <strong>
            Organisational Barriers
           </strong>
           The factors related to organisation structure, authority relationships, rules and regulations may sometimes act as barriers to effective communication some of these barriers are
           <br/>
           (a)
           <strong>
            Organisational Policy
           </strong>
           If the organisational policy is not supportive to free flow of communication, it may hamper effectiveness of communications.
           <br/>
           (b)
           <strong>
            Rules and Regulations
           </strong>
           Rigid rules and cumbersome procedures may be a hurdle to communication similarly, communication through prescribed channel may result in delays.
           <br/>
           (c)
           <strong>
            Status
           </strong>
           Status of superior may create psychological distance between him and his subordinates. The people working at higher level may not allow his subordinates to express their feelings freely.
           <br/>
           (d)
           <strong>
            Complex Organisational Structure
           </strong>
           In an organisation where there are number of managerial levels, communications gets delayed and distorted as number of filtering points are more.
           <br/>
           (e)
           <strong>
            Organisational Facilities
           </strong>
           For smooth clear and timely communication proper facilities are required like frequent meetings suggestion box, internet connection, inter-com facility. Lack or ineffectiveness of these facilities may create communication problems.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv)
           <strong>
            Personal Barriers
           </strong>
<br/>
           The personal factors of both sender and receiver may exert influence on effective communication. Some of the personal barriers are
           <br/>
           (a)
           <strong>
            Fear of Challenge to Authority
           </strong>
           If a superior feels that a particular communication may affect his authority negatively then he/she may not speak it out clearly and openly.
           <br/>
           (b)
           <strong>
            Lack of Confidence of Superior on his Subordinate
           </strong>
           If superiors do not have confidence on their subordinates, they may not seek their advice or opinions.
           <br/>
           (c)
           <strong>
            Unwillingness to Communicate
           </strong>
           Sometime subordinator may not be prepared to communicate with their superiors, if they think that it may adversely affect their interests.
           <br/>
           (d)
           <strong>
            Lack of Proper Incentives
           </strong>
           If there is no reward for communication then employees may not be motivated to communication, e.g., if there is no reward or appreciation for a good suggestion, the subordinate may not be willing to offer useful suggestions again.
           <br/>
           Some measures which can be adopted by organisations to improve communications are
           <br/>
           (i)
           <strong>
            Clarify the Ideas Before Communication
           </strong>
           The entire message to be communicated should be studied in depth, analysed and stated in such a manner that it is clearly conveyed to subordinates. The message should be encoded in simple language which is understandable.
           <br/>
           (ii)
           <strong>
            Communication According to the Needs of Receives
           </strong>
           All managers should be aware of the understanding level of his/her subordinates. He should adjust his communication and select the words according to the education and understanding levels of subordinates
           <br/>
           (iii)
           <strong>
            Consult Others Before Communicating
           </strong>
           Before communicating anything, others who are linked with it in some way or the other should be taken into confidence for developing a better plan.
           <br/>
           (iv)
           <strong>
            Beaware of Languages, Tone and Content of Message
           </strong>
<br/>
           The language used for communication should be understandable to the listener. The tone of the appropriate and the matter should not be offending to anyone.
           <br/>
           (v)
           <strong>
            Convey Things of Help and Value to Listener
           </strong>
<br/>

            Follow up Communication
           </strong>
<br/>
           There should be a regular follow up and review on the instructions given to subordinates. Such follow up measures help in removing hurdles if any in implementing the instructions.
           <br/>
           (viii)
           <strong>
            Be a Good Listener
           </strong>
<br/>
           Manager should be a good listener. Patient and attentive listening solves half of the problems. Managers should also give indications of their interest in listening to their subordinates

            5. Explain different financial and non-financial incentives used to motivate employees of a company.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans:
           </strong>
           Financial Incentives Financial incentives refer to incentives which are in direct monetary form or measurable in monetary term and serve to motivate people for better performance. The financial incentives used in organisations are listed below
           <br/>
           (i)
           <strong>
            Pay and Allowances
           </strong>
           For every employee, salary is the basic monetary incentive. It includes basic pay, DA and other allowances. Salary system consists of regular increments in the pay every year and enhancement of allowances from time to time.
           <br/>
           (ii)
           <strong>
            Productivity Linked Wage Incentives
           </strong>
           Several wage incentives aim at linking payment of wages to increase in productivity at individual or group level.
           <br/>
           (iii)
           <strong>
            Profit Sharing
           </strong>
           Profit sharing is meant to provide a share to employees in the profits of the organisation. This serves to motivate the employees to improves their performance and contribute to increase in profits.
           <br/>
           (v)
           <strong>
            Co-Partnership/Stock Option
           </strong>
           Under these incentives schemes, employees are offered company shares at a set price which is lower than market price. The allotment of shares creates a peeling of ownership to the employees and makes them to contribute more for the growth of the organisation.
           <br/>
           (vi)
           <strong>
            Retirement Benefits
           </strong>
           Several retirement benefits such as provident fund, pension and gratuity provide financial security to employees after their retirement. This act as an incentive when they are in service in the organisation.
           <br/>
           (vii)
           <strong>
            Perquisites
           </strong>
<br/>
           In many companies perquisites and fringe benefits are offered such as car allowance, housing, medical aid, and education etc over and above the salary. These measures help to provide motivation to the employees/managers.
           <br/>
<strong>
            Non-financial Incentives
           </strong>
<br/>
