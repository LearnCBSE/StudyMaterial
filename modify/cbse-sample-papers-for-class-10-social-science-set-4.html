           Question 28.
           <br/>
           “Democratic Governments in practice are accountable.” Support the statement with arguments. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Democratic Governments in practice are accountable because:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            It is right to expect democracy to form a government that follows procedures and is accountable to the people.
           </li>
<li>
            It is also expected that the Democratic Government develops mechanisms for citizens to take part in decision-making whenever they think it is fit.
           </li>
<li>
            The Democratic Government is accountable to the people. If it ignores the will of the people, they will not elect their Rule,r in the next General Election.
           </li>
<li>
            The procedures and decision-making process should be transparent for the Democratic Government to be accountable to the people.
           </li>
</ul>

           A remarkable fact about India is that while there has been a change in the share of the three sectors in GDP, a similar shift has not taken place in employment. Why didn’t a similar shift out of primary sector happen in case of employment? Substantiate your answer.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A substantial shift in employment in primary sector hasnt happened because of the following reasons
           <br/>
           Insufficient job creation in the secondary and tertiary sectors The primary reason for the limited shift in employment from the primacy sector is the failure to generate an adequate number of jobs in the secondary (industrial) and tertiary (service) sectors.
          </p>
<p>
           The growth of industrial output and service sector production has been significant, but the corresponding increase in employment opportunities has been comparatively lower.
          </p>
<p>
           Underemployment ¡n the agricultural sector The primary section. particularly agriculture, suffers from underemployment, with more people engaged in farming than necessary. Even if a few individuals are moved out of agriculture, it does not significantly
           <br/>
           affect production. This indicates that workers in the agricultural sector are not fully utilised, leading to a lower productivity level.

           Question 30.
           <br/>
           “Nationalism no longer retained its idealistic liberal democratic sentiment by the last quarter of the nineteenth century in Europe.”
           <br/>
           Analyse the statement with examples. [5]
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           ” Nationalism spreads when people begin to believe that they are all part of the same nation”. Justify the statement
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Sentiment of Nationalism in the later half of the 19th century:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Towards the last quarter of the 19th century, nationalism could not retain its idealistic liberal-democratic sentiments of the first half of the century but became a narrow belief with inadequate ends.
           </li>
<li>
            Nationalist groups became increasingly intolerant, which led to war.
           </li>
<li>
            Major European powers manipulated the nationalist aspirations to further their own imperialist aims.
           </li>
<li>
            Source of nationalist tension in Europe was the area called Balkans.
           </li>
<li>
            Idea of romantic nationalism in the Balkan together with the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire made this region very explosive.
           </li>
<li>
            One by one, European nationalists broke away from its control and declared independence.
           </li>
<li>
            The Balkan people based their claims for independence or political rights on nationality to prove that they were once independent but were subjugated by a foreign power.
           </li>
<li>
            Slavic nationalities struggled to define their identity and independence. Hence, the Balkan area became an area of intense conflict.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           OR
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            The romanticism and cultural movements focused on emotions, Intuitions and mystical feelings to create a sense of a shared collective heritage, a common cultural past of a nation.
           </li>
<li>
            Folk songs, folk poetry and folk dances are true cultural spirits of a nation and these are essential to bind the people in a bond.
           </li>
<li>
            Importance of vernacular language also bind the people into a nation so that they can collectively think for their Nation
           </li>
<li>
            Music also helps to light up the feeling of nationalism-connection to one nation
           </li>
<li>
            The collection of local folklore was not just only to recover the national spirit, but also spread the message of nationalism among the illiterate people.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Question 31.
           <br/>
           How would you evaluate Napoleon as an administrator who created a more rational and efficient system? Elucidate
           <br/>
           with suitable examples.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Analyze the decisions taken by the conservatives at the Congress of Vienna in the year 1815. (5)
           <br/>
           Answer:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Napoleon was an administrator who created a more rational and efficient system This statement can be justified by the following reason
           </li>
<li>
            The Civil Code of 1804 usually known as the Napoleonic Code, secured the property right, established equality before the law, and removed all privileges based on birth.
           </li>
<li>
            The Napoleonic Code was followed by the regions under French control.
           </li>
<li>
            New businessmen, artisans, peasants and workers enjoyed a new-found freedom. in territories under French control such as Italy, Germany, Switzerland, and Dutch Republic, peasants were freed from manorial dues, peasants were freed from serfdom, feudal system was abolished, administrative divisions were simplified
           </li>
<li>
            Guild restrictions were removed in towns.
           </li>
<li>
            There were improvements in communication and transport systems.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           To facilitate the movement and exchange of goods and capital from one region to another, small-scale producers of goods and businessmen began to realise that common national currency. standardized measures and weights. and uniform laws were of
           <br/>
           great help.
          </p>
<p>
           Or
           <br/>
           The representatives of the four great European powers – Britain, Russia, Prussia, and Austria who had collectively defeated Napoleon, met at Vienna to draw up a settlement for Europe. The Congress was hosted by the Austrian Chancellor Duke Metternich. The result was the Treaty of Vienna of 1815.
          </p>
<p>
           Its object was to undo the changes that had come about in Europe during the Napoleonic wars and to restore the monarchies that had been overthrown by Napoleon, and create a new conservative order in Europe.
          </p>
<p>
           The Bourbon dynasty, (deposed during the French Revolution) was restored to power. France lost the territories it had annexed under Napoleon.
          </p>
<p>
           A series of states were set up on the boundaries of France to prevent it from expanding in the future. E.g., kingdom of the Netherlands, which included Belgium, was set up in the North.
          </p>
<p>
           Genoa was added to Piedmont in the South. Prussia was given territories on its Western frontiers. Austria was given control of Northern Italy.
          </p>
<p>
           The German confederation of 39 states set up by Napoleon was left untouched in the East, Russia was given part of Poland while Prussia was given a portion of Saxony.
          </p>
<p>
           Thus, conservative regimes set up in 1815 were autocratic. They did not tolerate criticism and dissent. They curbed activities that questioned the ‘legitimacy of autocratic governments.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 32.
           <br/>
           The focus on caste in politics can sometimes give an impression that elections are all about caste and nothing else. Do you agree with the given statement? Explain. [5]
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           Assess the influences of politics on the caste system.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           No, I do not agree with this statement. This is far from the truth because:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            No parliamentary constituency in the country has a dear majority of one single caste. So, every candidate and party needs to win the confidence of more than one caste and community to win elections.
           </li>
<li>
            No party wins the votes of all the voters of a caste or community. When people say that a caste is a ‘vote bank’ of one party, it usually means that a large proportion of the voters from the caste vote for the party.
           </li>
<li>
            Many political parties may put up candidates from the same caste (if that caste is believed to dominate the electorate in a particular constituency). Some voters have more than one candidate from their caste, while many voters have no candidates from their caste.
           </li>
<li>
            The Ruling Party of the sitting MP or MLA frequently loses elections in our country. That could not have happened if all castes or communities were frozen in their political preferences.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           OR
          </p>
<p>
           Influence of politics on caste :
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Each caste group tries to become bigger by incorporating within its sub-castes.
           </li>
<li>
            Various caste groups are required to enter into a coalition with other castes or communities.
           </li>
<li>
            New kinds of caste groups have entered politics like ‘backward’ and ‘forward’ castes.
           </li>
<li>
            Politics in caste has allowed many disadvantaged caste groups to demand their share of power.
           </li>
<li>
            Caste politics has helped the Dalits and OBCs to gain better access to decision-making.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Question 33.
           <br/>
           A farmer has borrowed money from a money-lender at a high rate of interest, and as he could not pay the interest, he was forced to
           <br/>
           borrow from another landlord to settle the amount for the interest borrowed from the money-lender. State the consequences he may face in this situation.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           “Self Help Groups eliminate poverty and empower women”. Substantiate with a suitable answer. (5)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The farmer has fallen into a debt trap. He is in a situation where he will not be able to repay the debt incurred because the informal sector was the source of credit opted by the farmer, where the rate of interest is high, no proper documentation is sought no set of rules and regulations will be followed.
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            He may face the following consequences
           </li>
<li>
            The farmer may face ongoing harassment and physical harm from the men sent by the money lender.
           </li>
<li>
            He will not be able to make regular interest payments or repay the full amount borrowed.
           </li>
<li>
            This could lead to significant stress and anxiety, as well as potential physical injuries.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Borrowing from another landlord to repay the original loan may create a cycle of debt for the farmer particularly if the interest rates on the second loan are also high.
          </p>
<p>
           The farmer may experience personal consequences, such as mental stress. anxiety and depression due to the constant pressure 01 repayments and harassment from the lenders.
          </p>
<p>
           Or
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Self-help groups eliminate poverty and empower women due to the following features
           </li>
<li>
            They avail the facilities of loans from formal sources like banks at low rate of interest.
           </li>
<li>
            They do not demand collateral so it is easy to access The poor.
           </li>
<li>
            Self-help groups are exclusively meant for rural women to make them economically independent through self-employment opportunities.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           It helps to improve other development factors such as literacy levels, improved healthcare and better family planning. SHGs provide women with a platform to save and access credit at affordable rates, which enables them to start and expand small businesses. Thus, improving the standard of living.

           Question 34.
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow: [4]
           <br/>
           Globalization expands and accelerates the movement and exchange of ideas and commodities over vast distances. Globalisation has created more competitive environment in India. In the past two to three decades, more and more MNCs have been looking for locations around the world which would be cheap for their production. Foreign investment by MNCs in these countries has been rising. At the same time, foreign trade between countries has been rising rapidly. A large part of the foreign trade is also controlled by MNCs.
          </p>
<p>
           The result of greater foreign investment and greater foreign trade has been greater integration of production and markets across countries. Globalisation is this process of rapid integration or interconnection between countries. MNCs are playing a major role in the globalisation process. More and more goods and services, investments and technology are moving between countries. Besides the movements of goods, services, investments and technology, there is one more way in which the countries can be connected. This is through the movement of people between countries. People usually move from one country to another in search of better income, better jobs or better education.
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Rapid improvement in technology has been one major factor that has stimulated the Globalisation process. Even more remarkable have been the developments in information and communication technology. Globalisation and greater competition among producers – both local and foreign producers – has been of advantage to consumers, particularly the well-off sections in the urban areas. There is greater choice before these consumers who now enjoy improved quality and lower prices for several products. As a result, these people today, enjoy much higher standards of living than was possible earlier. Globalisation has also created new opportunities for companies providing services, particularly those involving IT.
           </li>
<li>
            34.1 How has globalisation led to higher standards of living ? [1]
            <br/>
            Answer:
            <br/>
            Globalisation has led to higher standards of living of well-off customers. There is greater choice before these consumers who now enjoy improved quality and lower prices for several products.

<li>
            34.2 Name one major factor which has stimulated the globalisation process. [1]
            <br/>
            Answer:
            <br/>
            Rapid improvement in technology has been one major factor that has stimulated the Globalisation process.
           </li>
<li>
            34.3 For whom has globalization posed a major challenge? [2]
            <br/>
            Answer:
            <br/>
            Globalisation has posed a major challenge to the small scale producers having low capital investment and poor strategies to develop. They have been hit hard due to severe competition. Several units have been shut down rendering many workers jobless.

<p>
           Question 35.
           <br/>
           Read the source given below and answer the questions that follow.
           <br/>
           Maharashtra is a state located in Western India, with a population of over 110 million people. The state is home to several large
           <br/>
           cities, including Mumbai, and has a significant agricultural sector. However, the state is facing a severe water crisis, with its water
           <br/>
           resources coming under increasing pressure due to climate change, industrialisation, and urbanisation. The main challenges faced by water resource management in Maharashtra are:
           <br/>
           Overexploitation of groundwater Maharashtra is one of the most groundwater-stressed states in India, with the demand for water exceeding the supply. Overexploitation of groundwater for agriculture and urban usc has led to a decline in water levels, which has severe implications for the sustainability of water resources.
          </p>
<p>
           Pollution of surface water Industrialisation and urbanisation have led to the pollution of surface water bodies such as rivers and lakes. The pollution has led to water quality degradation, which poses risks to human health and the environment.
          </p>
<p>
           Inefficient irrigation practices The agricultural sector is the largest user of water in Maharashtra, accounting for around 80% of total water use. However, traditional irrigation practices such as flood irrigation are inefficient and lead to the wastage of water.
          </p>
<p>
           (i) Mention any two reasons for the water crisis faced by the state of Maharashtra.
           <br/>
           (ii) Despite being the second highest rainfall-receiving state of the country, Maharashtra still faces water crisis. Substantiate this statement in 40 words.
           <br/>
           (iii) Propose any one solution to mitigate the water crisis faced by Maharashtra state. (4)

           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Two reasons for Maharashtra facing a water crisis are overexploitation of groundwater and pollution of surface water bodies due to industrialisation and urbanisation.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Despite receiving the second-highest rainfall in thern country. traditional irrigation practices like flood irrigation leading to water shortages in Maharashtra. This is because flood irrigation involves excessive water use, and the water gets lost due to runoff. leading to less water available for other uses.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) To mitigate the water crisis in Maharashtra, one solution could be to promote the adoption of more efficient irrigation practices, such as drip irrigation and sprinkler systems. that use less water and are more targeted in their delivery. The state can also use rainwater harvesting system to improve groundwater levels along the Western side of the Western Ghats which receives maximum rainfall. This will increase the efficiency of water use in the state of Maharashtra.

           Question 36.
           <br/>
           Read the extract given below and answer the questions that follow: [4]
           <br/>
           Before the age of machine industries, silk and cotton goods from India dominated the international market in textiles. Coarser cotton was produced in many countries, but the finer varieties often came from India. Armenian and Persian merchants took the goods from Punjab to Afghanistan, Eastern Persia and Central Asia. Bales of fine textiles were carried on camelback via the northwest frontier, through mountain passes, and across deserts.
          </p>
<p>
           A vibrant sea trade operated through the main pre-colonial ports. Surat on the Gujarat coast connected India to the Gulf and Red Sea Ports; Masulipatnam on the Coromandel Coast and Hooghly in Bengal had trade links with Southeast Asian Ports. Bengal had trade links with Southeast Asian Ports. A variety of Indian merchants and bankers were involved in the network of export trade — financing production, carrying goods, and supplying exporters.
          </p>
<p>
           Supply merchants linked the port towns to the inland regions. They gave advances to weavers, procured the woven cloth from weaving villages, and carried the supply to the ports. At the port, the big shippers and export merchants had brokers who negotiated the price and bought goods from the supply merchants operating inland. By the 1750s this network, controlled by Indian merchants, was breaking down. The European companies gradually gained power—first securing a variety of concessions from local courts, then the monopoly rights to trade.
          </p>
<p>
           This resulted in a decline of the old ports of Surat and Hoogly through which local merchants had operated. Exports from these ports fell dramatically, the credit that had financed the earlier trade began drying up, and the local bankers slowly went bankrupt. In the last years of the seventeenth century, the gross value of trade that passed through Surat had been Rs. 16 million. By the 1740’s it had slumped to Rs 3 million.
          </p>
<p>
