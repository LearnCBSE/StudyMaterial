           Management of joint injuries :
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Cold compression should be used immediately. The application of ice or cold water should not be used for more than 40 minutes persistently.
           </li>
<li>
            The cold compression should be performed 5 to 6 times daily.
           </li>
<li>
            If there is more swelling at the sight of contusion, the anti-inflammatory medicine should be given.
           </li>
<li>
            If the swelling persists, consult the doctor immediately.
           </li>

           <br/>
           Mention all calculations and steps involved to draw a Knock-out fixture of 19 teams, where 4 teams are to be seeded. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Knock-out tournaments : In knock-out tournaments, the teams which get eliminated get out automatically from the tournament. Only the winners continue in the competition. It is the fastest method to know about the winner team in the tournament.
          </p>
<p>
           Seeding a Team : The sorting of the teams and fitting them in the fixtures , so that the stronger teams do not meet each other in earlier rounds is known as seedings.
           <br/>

          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            These are less expensive.
           </li>

           </li>
<li>
            It requires less time to complete the tournament.
           </li>
<li>
            Minimum number of officials are required. Total number of rounds played in tournament depends upon number of teams participating in tournament.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Drawing a Knock-out fixtures of 19 Teams :
           <br/>
           Number of Teams—19

           Question 22.
           <br/>
           What are the types of motor development ? Describe any six factors affecting motor development in children. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Motor Development : It refers to the development of general body control, fine motor skills and large muscle movements. There are three stages of motor development in children- infancy or infancyhood, early childhood and later childhood.
           <br/>
           It is of two types :
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Gross Motor development : It involves the development of large muscles in the child’s body such as sitting, walking, running etc.
           </li>
<li>
            Fine Motor development : It involves the development of small muscles of the body, especially during the small movements of the fingers and hands, Example : holding of Javelin, discus and pole, catching a cricket ball etc.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Factors affecting Motor Developments :
           <br/>
           (i) Nutrition : Nutritious food promotes good motor development. Sensory motor development is dependent upon nutrition that the child gets to a good extent. Children get stronger if they get nutritious food.
           <br/>
           (ii) Immunisation : If mother and child both are immunised at proper time, it leads to a good sensory motor development.
           <br/>
           (iii) Environment : Encouragement, love and security help the child to take risk to explore fearlessly and to know more about environment which leads to a better sensory development. Some of other factors affecting Motor development :
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Sleep
           </li>

           Question 24.
           <br/>
           Write in detail about the physiological changes taking place due to ageing. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The physiological changes, due to ageing, which take place are mentioned herein :
           <br/>
           (i) Changes in Nervous System : The reaction time and movement time slow down with increase of age. The brain waits, the size of its network and its blood flow decreases with age.
           <br/>
           (ii) Change in Gastrointestinal System: With an increase in age, there is a reduction in the production of Hydrochloric acid, digestive enzymes and saliva. These changes may result in delayed emptying of the stomach, impaired swallowing. The breakdown and absorption of food may also be impaired. The liver becomes less efficient in metabolising drugs and repairing damages liver cells.
           <br/>
           (iii) Changes in Urinal system: With an increas¬ing age the mass of the kidney decreases, which leads to reduction in blood filtration by the kidneys. The capacity of the bladders decreases and there is an increase in residual urine. This
           <br/>
           increases the chance of urinal infections.
           <br/>
           (iv) Changes in Senses : With an advance in age, the senses such as vision, hearing, taste, smell and touch may become less active. Vision and hearing are affected the most by ageing. The taste buds are reduced with age. So, they loose interest in food.
           <br/>
           (v) Change in Respiratory System : Pulmonary function is impaired with advancing age. The airways and lung tissues become less elastic and less efficient. There is decrease in the oxygen uptake and oxygen exchange.
           <br/>
           (vi) Change in Fitness : The elasticity of tendons, ligaments and joint capsules decrease with ageing. The range of the movements is restricted and muscle mass decreases as the age increases. This leads a decrease in flexibility, endurance, strength and speed along with a shortness of breath, blood flow, enzymes etc.
