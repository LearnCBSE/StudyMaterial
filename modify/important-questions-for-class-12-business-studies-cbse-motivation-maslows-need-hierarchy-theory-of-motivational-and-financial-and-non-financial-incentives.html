<strong>
            (i) Changes negative attitude to positive attitude
           </strong>

           <br/>
<strong>
            (ii) Improves efficiency

           </strong>
           Malow’s Hierarchy of Need refers to the systematic arrangement of human needs. It is considered fundamental to understanding of motivation. Motivation has a direct link with needs. People have wide range of needs.
           <br/>
           Maslow classified human needs into five categories in order of priority:
           <br/>
<strong>
            (i) Physiological needs
           </strong>
           These needs include the needs for food, water, clothing, and shelter. These are also called the basic needs and are common to all individuals. The fulfillment of these need is necessary for the survival of human beings
           <br/>
<strong>
            (ii) Safety and security needs
           </strong>
           These needs provide security and protection from emotional and physical harm, e.g. job security, stability of income, pension plans, etc.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (iii) Affiliation/Belonging needs
           </strong>
           These needs refer to affection, sense of belongingness, acceptance and friendship.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (iv) Esteem needs
           </strong>
           These needs concern with the desire to prove one’s worth in the eyes of others, e.g. self-respect, self-confidence, etc.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (v) Self-actualisation needs
           </strong>
           This need is related to the development of one’s potential to fullest possible extent.
           <br/>
           A manager must understand the needs and wants of people in order to motivate them to work. A satisfied need can no longer persuade/motivate a person. It is only the next higher level need that can motivate a person. For satisfaction of these needs, management must offer different incentives, financial or non-financial. e.g.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (i) Physiological needs
           </strong>
           For this, they offer monetary incentives, e.g. good salary/wages and comfortable working conditions.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (ii) Safety and security needs
           </strong>
           For these needs, they offer job security , pension, insurance, etc.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (iii) Social Needs
           </strong>
           For satisfaction of these needs, they encourage team-building and provides workers, the opportunity to interact socially.

<strong>
            Types of non-financial incentives
           </strong>
<br/>

           It is one of the most important motivator. It helps in improving the attitudes of employees and at the same time, motivates them to put their best efforts. Efficiency and innovations of the workers should be recognised and praised. Recognition can be given by appreciating the work, installing awards and certificates, display of achievements on the notice board, etc.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (iv) Job enrichment
           </strong>
           Assignment of challenging Jobs is a significant non-financial incentive.Assignment of challenging work to subordinates provide opportunities for maximum development ‘ and helps them to reach upto the point of self-realisation.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (v) Status
           </strong>
           In the organisation context, status means ranking of positions in the organisation. The status of a person is reflected in his authority, responsibility, pre-requisites and recognition. Psychological, social and esteem needs of an individual are satisfied by status.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (vi)Organisation climate
           </strong>
           Organisational climate refers to the sum total of characteristics like individual autonomy, reward orientation, consideration to employees, risk-taking, etc. A positive climate serves as an incentive, supportive relationships, knowledge of work done, healthy competition for superior performance, etc are motivating factors.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (vii) Career advancement opportunity
           </strong>
           Most of the employees want to explore in their career. An organisation can motivate its employees by providing them opportunities for in-service training and promotion. In other words, if the employees are provided the opportunity for their advancement and growth and to develop their potentiality, they feel very much satisfied and become more committed towards the organisation goals.
