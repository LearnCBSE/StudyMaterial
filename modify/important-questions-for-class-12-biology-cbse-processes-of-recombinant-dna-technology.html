             Biotechnology: Principles and ProcessesÂ Important Questions for CBSE Class 12 Biology Processes of Recombinant DNA Technology
            </strong>
</span>
</h2>
<p>
<strong>
            1. Recombinant DNA Technology
           </strong>
           involves the following steps in sequence:
           <br/>
           (i) Isolation of the genetic material (DNA) is carried out in the following steps:
           <br/>
           (a) DNA is enclosed within the membranes. To release DNA along with other macromolecules such as RNA, proteins, polysaccharides and lipids, bacterial cells/plant or animal tissue are treated with enzymes such as lysozyme (bacteria),
           <strong>
            cellulase
           </strong>
           (plant cells),
           <strong>
            chitinase
           </strong>
           (fungus).
           <br/>
           (b) RNA can be removed by treatment with ribonuclease.
           <br/>
           (c) Proteins can be removed by treatment with protease.
           <br/>
           (d) Other molecules can be removed by appropriate treatments and purified DNA ultimately precipitates out as fine threads in the suspension after the addition of chilled ethanol
           <br/>
<strong>
            (ii) Cutting of DNA at specific locations
           </strong>
           is done by using restriction enzymes. The purified DNA is incubated with the specific restriction enzyme at conditions optimum for the enzyme to act.
           <br/>

<strong>
            (iii) Isolation of desired DNA fragment
           </strong>
           is carried out using agarose gel electrophoresis (as discussed earlier).
           <br/>
<strong>
            (iv) Amplification of gene of interest using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
           </strong>
           is a reaction in which multiple copies of specific DNA (gene of interest) sequence are made (amplification) in vitro. The technique was developed by Kary Mullis in 1985 who received Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1993.
           <br/>
           (a) PCR technique requires
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
             A DNA template
            </strong>
            which is a double stranded DNA that needs to be amplified.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Primers
            </strong>
            are small chemically made oligonucleotides of about 10-18 nucleotides that are complementary to a region of template DNA.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Enzymes
            </strong>
            used are DNA Taq polymerase (from a bacterium, Thermus aquaticus).
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           (b) Steps in PCR
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
             Denaturation
            </strong>
            of double stranded DNA is carried out by applying high temperature of 95Â°C for 15 seconds. Each separated single strand acts as a template for DNA synthesis.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Annealing
            </strong>
            is carried out by two sets of primers, which are added in the reaction. They anneal to the 3â² end of each separated strand. Primers act as initiator of replication.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Extension
            </strong>
            is done by DNA polymerase by adding nucleotides complementary to the template in the reaction.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
            * A thermostable
           </strong>
           DNA polymerase (Taq polymerase) is used in the reaction, which can tolerate the high temperature of the reaction.
           <br/>
<img alt="important-questions-for-class-12-biology-cbse-processes-of-recombinant-dna-technology-tp2-img 2jpg_Page1" class="aligncenter" height="363" loading="lazy" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5716/23332692911_3d1aea21d2_o.jpg" width="503"/>
           (c) These steps are repeated many times to obtain several copies of the desired DNA.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (v) Ligation of DNA fragment into a vector
           </strong>
           requires a vector DNA and source DNA.
           <br/>
           (a) These are cut with the same endonuclease to obtain sticky ends.
           <br/>
           (b) Both are then ligated by mixing vector DNA, gene of interest and enzyme DNA ligase to form recombinant DNA.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (vi) Insertion of recombinant DNA into the host cell/organism
           </strong>
           occurs by several methods, before which the recipient cells are made competent to receive the DNA.
           <br/>
           (a) If recombinant DNA carrying antibiotic resistance gene (e.g. ampicillin), is
           <br/>
           transferred into E. coli cells, the host cell is transformed into ampicillin resistant cells.
           <br/>
           (b) The ampicillin resistant gene can be called a selectable marker.
           <br/>
           (c) When transformed cells are grown on agar plates containing ampicillin, only transformants will grow and others will die.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (vii) Culturing the host cells
           </strong>
           The cell containing the foreign gene is cultured on an appropriate medium at optimal conditions. The DNA gets multiplied.
           <br/>
           (viii) Extraction of desired gene product is carried out in the following steps:
           <br/>
           (a) A protein encoding gene expressed in a heterologous host is called recombinant protein.
           <br/>
           (b) Cells having genes of interest can be grown on a small or on a large scale.
           <br/>
           (c) In small scale, cells are grown on cultures and then expressed protein is extracted and purified by various separation methods.
           <br/>
           (d) In large scale, cells are grown in a continuous culture system in which fresh medium is added from one side to maintain cells growth phase and the desired protein is collected from the other side.

<strong>
            2. Bioreactors
           </strong>
           are the large volume (100-1000 L) vessels in which raw materials are biologically converted into specific products, individual enzymes, etc, using microbial plant, animal or human cells.
           <br/>
           (i) It provides the optimal conditions for achieving the desired product by providing optimal growth conditions like temperature,
           <strong>
            pH
           </strong>
           , substrate, salt, vitamins andÂ oxygen.
           <br/>
           (ii)The most commonly used bioreactors are of stirring type:
           <br/>
<img alt="important-questions-for-class-12-biology-cbse-processes-of-recombinant-dna-technology-tp2-img 3jpg_Page1" class="aligncenter" height="268" loading="lazy" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5681/23415263935_f2bbd073ed_o.jpg" width="565"/>
           (iii) The stirred-tank reactor is usually cylindrical or with a curved base to facilitate the mixing of the reactor contents.
           <br/>
           (vi) The stirrer facilitates mixing and oxygen availability throughout the bioreactor.
           <br/>
           (v) In the spar ged stirred tank bioreactor, sterile air bubbles are sparged, to increase the surface area foi oxygen transfer.
           <br/>
           (vi) The co mpo.nor.its of a bioreactox are:
           <br/>
           (a) An agitator systemÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (b) An oxygen delivery system
           <br/>
           (c) A foam control system Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â (d)4 temperature control system
           <br/>
           (e) pH control system
           <br/>
           (f ) Sampling ports to withdraw small volumes of culture periodically
          </p>
<p>
           3. Downstream processing After the product formation in bioreactions, they are
           <br/>
           subjected to a series of processes, collectivelv referred to as downstream processing.
           <br/>
           Tb ese include:
           <br/>
           (i) Â Separation of desired product.
           <br/>
           (ii) Purification of products.
           <br/>
           (iii) formulated with preservatives. .
           <br/>
           Finally, these products undergo strict quality control testing before being marketed
           <br/>
           as a finished products.

           Since, DNA is negatively charged molecule so, they can be forced to separate out according to their size towards anode under an electric field through a medium or matrix (commonly used is agarose). Shorter molecule moves faster and migrate further than the lohger one.

           The products obtained through this technique can be utilised as follows:
           <br/>
           (i) Construction of recombinant DNA by joining with cloning vectors.
           <br/>
           (ii) Used in making multiple copies of same DNA by using PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction).

            2. How can the following be made possible for biotechnology experiments?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            (i) Isolation of DNA from bacterial cell.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            (ii) Reintroduction of the recombinant DNA into a bacterial cell.
           </strong>

           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           (i) Isolation of DNA from bacterial cell can be done by:
           <br/>
           (a) treating the bacterial cells with enzymes such as lysozyme to remove cell wall.
           <br/>
           (b) the RNA associated with DNA can be removed by treatment with ribonuclease, whereasÂ protein can be removed by treatment with protease. Similarly other molecules (if any) are removed by appropriate treatment.
           <br/>
           (ii) Reintroduction of the recombinant DNA into bacterial cell can be done by the following methods:
           <br/>
           (a) The recipient bacterial cell is made âcompetentâ to take up the recombinant DNA by treatment with a specific increase in concentration of calcium ions.
           <br/>
           (b) the recombinant DNA is forced into the cells by heat shock treatment, i.e. by incubating theÂ cells with rDNA followed by placing them at 42Â°C (heat shock) and then putting them back on ice. This enables bacteria to take up rDNA.
          </p>

</strong>
<strong>
            (ii) Write the term given to A and C and why?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            (iii) Expand PCR. Mention its importance in biotechnology. [Delhi 2011]
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           (i) (a) A is recognition or restriction site (AATTC), which is recognised by restriction enzyme Eco
           <br/>
           (b) B is rop gene protein involved in the replication of plasmid coded by this gene.
           <br/>
           (ii) A and C are called palindromes. These are sequence of base pairs that reads same on the two strands of DNA, when orientation of reading is kept same.
           <br/>
           (iii) PCR is polymerase chain reaction, multiple copies of the gene of interest can be synthesised in vitro by this technique. Thus, PCR can be utilised to amplify a single gene or fragment into thousands of copies to be used in cloning experiments.
