<strong>
            Answer the following questions.
           </strong>
<br/>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Question 1:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Why was the king advised to go to the magicians?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Some of the wise men thought that in order to decide right time for doing something, one must look into the future and only magicians were able to do that. So, they advised the king to go to the magicians.
          </p>
<p>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Question 2:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           In answer to the second question, whose advice did the people say would be important to the king?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           In answer to the second question some people, suggested to seek advice of councillors, the priest or the doctors or the soldiers.
          </p>
<p>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Question 3:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           What suggestions were made in answer to the third question?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           For the third question some people said science was the most important business while there were others who believed it was fighting and then there were those who believed religious worship should take the first place.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Question 4:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Did the wise men win the reward? If not, why not?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           No, the wise men didn’t win the reward because their answers were so different from each other and king was not satisfied with their answers.
          </p>
<p>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Question 5:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           How did the king and the hermit help the wounded man?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           The king washed the wound and covered the wound of the man with his handkerchief and kept on dressing it until the bleeding stopped completely.
           <br/>
           The king also offered the wounded man water to drink. The hermit helped the king to bring the wounded man inside his hut and allowed the man to spend his night in the hut.
          </p>
<p>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Question 6:
            </strong>
</span>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
            Who was the bearded man?
           </li>
<li>
            Why did he ask for the king’s forgiveness?
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
            The bearded man was an enemy of the king. He wanted to take revenge of his brother’s death by killing the king and taking away all his property.
           </li>
<li>
            The bearded man asked for the king’s forgiveness because he wanted to kill the king but the king has saved his life. He was grateful to the king now.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Question 7:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           The king forgave the bearded man. What did he do to show his forgiveness?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           The king showed his forgiveness by promising the man that he will send his doctor and servants to look after him and also promised to return him all his property.
          </p>

<p>
<span style="color: #eb4924;">
<strong>
             Question 8:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           What were the hermit’s answers to the three questions? Write each answer separately. Which answers do you like the most and why?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           The most important time, the hermit said, is our present because it is the only moment when we have the power to act. The most important person at a moment is we ourselves because the future is unknown and we don’t know whether we will meet anyone in the future or not.
           <br/>
           So, we should listen to ourselves.
           <br/>
           The most important business is to be kind and good to others because we have been sent in this world to serve this noble cause.
           <br/>
           I liked the third answer the most because helping someone in need is like serving God. It makes us a good person and brings a sense of satisfaction and contentment.
          </p>

            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Imagine you are the king. Narrate the incident of your meeting with the hermit. Begin like this: The wise men answered my questions, but I was not satisfied with their answers. One day I decided to go and meet the hermit….
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           I knew the hermit used to help only ordinary men, so I left behind my servants and bodyguards. I went to meet him wearing simple clothes. The hermit was an old man and used to live in a hut amidst the woods. He was digging the ground in front of his hut when I arrived there. He greeted me and continued his work. I informed him the purpose of my visit, but still he continued digging the ground. He looked tired so I offered my help. He agreed, so I took the spade from him and started digging the ground.
           <br/>
           After digging for many hours I again repeated my questions, but the hermit did not answer.
           <br/>
           Evening was approaching and now I thought of returning. Suddenly, the hermit showed me a bearded man who was running towards us.
          </p>

</span>
<br/>
           Imagine you are the hermit. Write briefly the incident of your meeting the king. Begin like this:
           <br/>
           One day I was digging in my garden. A man in ordinary clothes came to see me. I knew it was the king….
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           but still pretended to be unaware of his identity. He told me that he has come to me to get answers for his three questions.
           <br/>
           I greeted him and continued digging the ground. I was tired digging the ground; the king noticed this and offered his help. I agreed and gave my spade to him.
           <br/>
           After digging two beds in the ground the king repeated his questions, I ignored him again and rather asked him if he was tired and would like me to dig the ground. But he refused to do so and continued the task.
           <br/>
           Evening was approaching and it seemed that he was ready to leave, at that very moment we saw a man running towards us.

<strong>
             Question 1:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Do you think we should help people in need? Why so?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
             Solution:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           We should always help people in need. We have been sent to this world to do good to others. If we are good and kind towards other, people will respect us for our kindness.

             Question 2:
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           The king helped the hermit in digging the beds. He even slept on the floor of the hut and lived like a simple man in the hermit’s hut. What lesson we learn from this?
           <br/>
<strong>
<span style="color: #008000;">
             Solution:
            </span>
</strong>
<br/>
           The king found the old hermit tired digging the beds so he offered his help to the man. He was accustomed of comfort and lavishness in his palace still at hermit’s home he slept on the floor. At our homes we get all the luxuries but if one day there comes a situation where we have to live without them we should be prepared for that.
           <br/>
           In life we might become very rich and affluent one day still we should be simple from heart and must not be ashamed of embracing it at any moment
