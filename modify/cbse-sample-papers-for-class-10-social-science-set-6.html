<ul>
<li>
            Spanish conquerors won America with not a conventional military weapon but with germs like smallpox which spread deep into the continent before any European could reach there.
           </li>
<li>
            America’s original inhabitants had no immunity against these diseases that came from Europe. This disease erased the whole community, leading to conquest. This biological warfare in the mid-sixteenth century made it easy for Spanish to overpower the Americans.

           The Indian constitution provides three lists to distribute the legislative power. State any two subjects that are included in the union list. In which list the subject 11 Education” is included and why? [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) The Indian Constitution has a three-fold distribution of legislative power, which contains three lists: The Union List, the State List, and the Concurrent List. The subjects that are included in the Union List are those that are under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Union Government.
          </p>

           “Water scarcity may’ be an outcome of a large and growing population in India. Analyze the statement.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Yes, I agree that rooftop rainwater harvesting is quite beneficial for urban people. The rainwater harvesting system is one of the best methods, practiced and followed to support the conservation of water.
           <br/>
           The benefits of the rainwater harvesting system are listed below
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Helps in reducing the water bill,

</ul>
<p>
           Or
           <br/>
           Water scarcity may be an outcome of large and growing population in India. It can be analysed through the following points
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Post-independent India witnessed intensive industrialization and urbanisation. This situation increased water demand.
           </li>
<li>
            The growing demand of water by the growing population leads the over-exploitation of water resources for various purposes.
           </li>
<li>
            For example, for drinking, domestic uses, agriculture, electricity generation, and so on.
           </li>
<li>
            Increasing urban centers with large and dense populations and urban lifestyles have not only added to water and energy requirements but have further aggravated the prob’em of water scarcity.
           </li>

           (A) Analyze the impact of mining activities on the local environment and the health of the surrounding communities. [5]
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           (B) “Non-conventional resources are the best option to conserve natural resources” Substantiate this statement with examples.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (A)
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            The miners are prone to inhaling the dust and noxious fumes that make them vulnerable to pulmonary diseases. There is also a risk of mine roofs collapsing.
           </li>
<li>
            The miners are at a constant risk of inundation and fires in coal mines.
           </li>
<li>
            Mining hurts the environment as it produces a lot of waste.
           </li>
<li>
            Mining disrupts the local flora and fauna and contaminates the local water sources.
           </li>
<li>
            It can also require the removal of the topsoil, leading to soil erosion.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           OR
           <br/>
           (B)
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Non-conventional resources are also known as renewable sources of energy. Examples of non-conventional sources of energy include solar energy. bioenergy, tidal energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, natural gas, etc.
           </li>
<li>
            They are inexhaustible and renewable. They are also considered as clean sources of energy.
           </li>
<li>
            Optimal use of resources of energy minimizes environmental impact and non-conventional resources produce minimum secondary waste compared to conventional sources.
           </li>
<li>
            The growing consumption of energy has resulted in the country becoming increasingly dependent on fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas. Rising prices of oil and gas and their potential shortages have raised uncertainties about the security of energy supply in the future, which in turn, has serious repercussions on the growth of the national economy.
           </li>
<li>
            Natural gas is considered an environment-friendly fuel because of low carbon emissions. It does not cause air pollution or environmental degradation. Thus, it is the fuel for the present century.
           </li>
<li>
            Renewable energy resources provide an excellent opportunity for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and reducing global warming through substituting conventional energy sources.

           Question 31.
           <br/>
           Explain the limited participation of Dalits in the Civil Disobedience Movement. (5)
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Discuss the Salt March and make clear why it was an effective symbol of resistance against colonialism. (5)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Dalit participation was limited in the Civil Disobedience Movement, This can be explained in the following ways
           <br/>
           Dalit or untouchables belong to the lower strata of our society. The Congress Party ignored the Dalits for fear of offending the conservative high-caste Hindus i.e. sanatanis. Gandhiji first realised that Swaraj would not come for a hundred years if untouchability was not eliminated, But, many Dalit leaders believed in a different political solution to the problem of their
           <br/>
           community.
          </p>
<p>
           Dalits thought that only political empowerment would resolve their problem of social disabilities.
          </p>
<p>
           Dr. Ambedkar demanded a separate electorate for Dalits. which was denied by Gandhiji Oahts began organising themselves, demanding reserve seats in educational institutions and a separate electorate that would choose the Dalit members for legislative councils.
          </p>
<p>
           Dalit Movement continued to be apprehensive of the Congress-led national movement. Due to these above reasons. Datit’s their participation was limited in the Civil Disobedience Movement.
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Gandhi reached Dandi on 6th April, 1930 and violated Salt law by manufacturing salt from seawater, Breaking the Salt law was an apparent defiance of British authority and was a direct challenge to British rule in India.
          </p>
<p>
           people were not only asked to refuse cooperation with the British. but to break the unjustified colonial laws, Thousands of people from different parts of the country broke the Salt law, manufactured it, and demonstrated in front of government salt factories. With the spread of the movement. foreign cloth was boycotted, liquor shops were picketed, peasants refused to pay revenue, chaukidari taxes, village officials resigned, forest people violated forest laws by collecting wood and grading their cattle in the forest. Sali March inspired people from different segments of our society and became our effective tool of resistance against the colonial power.
          </p>
<p>
           Salt March was an effective symbol or tod of resistance against colonialism because All classes could identify with salt as it was an essential food item. Tax on salt and the monopoly over its manufacturing was a sign of the oppression of British rule.

           Question 33.
           <br/>
           Evaluate the term communa1 politics’. Also, explain the idea behind communal politics. (1+4)
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Is it correct to state that it is not politics that gets caste-ridden, but it is the caste that gets politicized? If yes, explain.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The use of religion in politics, where one religion is shown as superior to other religions is called communal politics. Here, one religious group is against the other religious group and the demands of one religious group are against the demands of the other religious group.
          </p>
<p>
           The idea behind communal politics is
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Communal politics is based on the idea that religion is the only basis of forming a community.
           </li>
<li>
            It believes that followers of one religion belong to the same community. Their interests, ideas, and opinions are the same.
           </li>
<li>
            Communal politics follows that people belonging to different religions cannot be a part of the same community. Their ideas and demands are bound to be different.
           </li>
<li>
            In an extreme case of communalism, communal politics follows that people from different religions are not equal citizens and cannot live together within one nation, which leads to partition of that country.
           </li>
<li>
            Communal politics is a belief that a particular community has same voice is fundamentally wrong. People of one religion do not have the same interests and aspirations in every context. All voices inside a community have a right to be heard.
            <br/>
            Or
            <br/>
            Yes, it is correct to say that it is riot politics that gets caste-ridden, but it is the caste that gets politicised.
           </li>
<li>
            Caste can take various forms in politics as Each caste group tries to become bigger by incorporating within it neighboring castes or sub-castes which were earlier excluded from it.
           </li>
<li>
            Various caste groups are required to enter a coalition with other castes or communities and thus enter a dialogue and negotiation.
           </li>
<li>
            New kinds of caste groups have come up in the political arena like ‘backward’ and ‘forward’ caste groups.
           </li>
<li>
            Caste plays different kinds of roles in politics In some cases, politics gives many disadvantaged communities, the opportunity to demand their share of power.

           Question 34.
           <br/>
           Read the source given below and answer the questions that follow:
           <br/>
           It is said that “passive resistance” is the weapon of the weak, but the power which is the subject of this article can be used only by the strong. This power is not passive resistance; indeed, it calls for intense activity. The movement in South Africa was not passive but active ‘Satyagraha is not physical force. Satyagraha does not inflict pain on the adversary; he does not seek his destruction … In the use of satyagraha, there is no ill will whatever. ‘Satyagraha is pure soul force.
          </p>
<p>
           Truth is the very substance of the soul. That is why this force is called satyagraha. The soul is informed with knowledge. In it burns the flame of love. … Nonviolence is the supreme dharma …‘ It is certain that India cannot rival Britain or Europe in force of arms. The British worship the war god and they can all of them become, as they are becoming, bearers of arms. The hundreds of millions in India can never carry arms. They have made the religion of non-violence their own.
          </p>
<p>
           In his famous book Hind Swaraj (1909) Mahatma Gandhi declared that British rule was established in India, with the cooperation of Indians, and had survived only because of this cooperation. If Indians refused to cooperate, British rule would collapse within a year.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 34.1.
           <br/>
           Why did Gandhiji say that passive resistance is not the weapon of the weak? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Passive resistance calls for intensive activity which can only be used by the strong. This is why Gandhiji said that passive resistance is not the weapon of the weak.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 34.2.
           <br/>
           “Satyagraha is pure soul force.” Substantiate this statement in 20 words. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Satyagraha uses the force of truth which itself is the substance of the soul that is informed with knowledge. This is why satyagraha is pure soul-force.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 34.3.
           <br/>
           What according to Mahatma Gandhi is the best weapon to use to collapse British rule in India?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In his book Hind Swaraj, Gandhiji declared that non-cooperation would be the best weapon to collapse British rule in India. It was only because of the Indian cooperation that the British were able to set their rule here.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 35.
           <br/>
           Read the given extract and answer the following questions.
           <br/>
           Decaying plants in swamps produce peat which has a low carbon and high moisture content and low beating capacity. Lignite is
           <br/>
           low-grade brown coal, which is soft with high moisture content. The principal lignite reserves are in Neyveli in Tamil Nadu and are used for generation of electricity. Coal that has been buried deep and subjected to increased temperatures is bituminous. h is the most popular coal in commercial use. Metallurgical coal is high-grade bituminous coal which has a special value for smelting iron in blast furnaces. Anthracite is the highest quality hard coal.
          </p>
<p>
           In India, coal occurs in rock series of two main geological ages, namely Gondwana, a little over 200 million years in age and in
           <br/>
           tertiary deposits which are only about 55 million years old. The major resources of Gondwana coal, which are metallurgical coal, are located in Damodar Valley (West Bengal, Jharkhand). Jharia, Raniganj, Bokaro are important coalfields. The Godavari, Mahanadi, Son, and Wardha valleys also contain coal deposits. Tertiary coals occur in the North-Eastern states of
           <br/>
           Meghalaya, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland.
           <br/>
           (i) Which reserves in Tamil Nadu is an important source of lignite in India? (1)
           <br/>
           (ii) What is bituminous coal? Also, evaluate its any one property. (2)
           <br/>
           (iii) State the reason due to why coal is associated with geological ages. (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Neyveh reserves in Tamil Nadu are important lignite reserves in India,

           (ii) Bituminous coal is a high-grade coal and thus, is a metallurgical coal. This type of coal has a special value for smelting iron in blast furnaces. An important property of bituminous coal is that it is buried deep under the Earth’s surface and is subjected to increased temperature.
           <br/>
           (iii) Coal is associated with geological ages because coal is formed due to compression of plant material and takes millions of years to come into existence.

           Question 36.
           <br/>
           Read the source given below and answer the questions that follow:
           <br/>
           For comparing countries, their income is considered to be one of the most important attributes. Countries with higher income are more developed than others with less income. This is based on the understanding that more income means more of all things that human being need. Whatever people like, and should have, they will be able to get with greater income. So, greater income itself is considered to be one important goal. Now, what is the income of a country? Intuitively, the income of the country is the income of all the residents of the country. This gives us the total income of the country. However, for comparison between countries, total income is not such a useful measure. Since, countries have different populations, comparing total income will not tell us what an average person is likely to earn. Are people in one country better off than others in a different country? Hence, we compare the average income which is the total income of the country divided by its total population.
          </p>
<p>
           The average income is also called per capita income. In World Development Reports, brought out by the World Bank, this criterion is used in classifying countries. Countries with per capita income of US$ 49,300 per annum and above in 2019, are called high-income or rich income or rich countries and those with per capita income of 125$ 2,500 or less are called low-income countries. The rich countries, excluding countries of the Middle East and certain other small countries are generally called development countries.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 36.1.
           <br/>
           Explain the significance of per capita income.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Per capita income enables comparisons between countries and provides insights into the relative economic performance and living standards across different nations. It also serves as an important indicator of the standard of living in a country.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 36.2
           <br/>
           What are the classifications of countries based on per capita income, and which entity is responsible for determining these classifications? [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The countries are classified into high-income or rich countries and low-income countries based on their per capita income. If the per capita income is US$ 49,300 per annum, it will be classified as a rich country and if the per capita income is US$ 2500 per annum, it will be called a poor country The World Bank determines these classifications.
