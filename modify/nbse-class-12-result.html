<h3>
           About Nagaland Board (NBSE)
          </h3>
<p>
           NBSE was set up through an Act by the Nagaland Legislative Assembly and received the assent of the Governor on the 15th of November 1973.
          </p>
<p>
           It started functioning from the 1st October 1974, and in March 1975, the Board held its first High School Leaving Certificate Examination at 6 (six) centers, for 2008 (two thousand and eight) candidates.  In trying to emerge with her own identity, a series of workshops, seminars, training, study tour were organized. Subsequently, the state level curriculum committee held its first meeting on the 30th March 1978 which led to a series of workshops to bring out our independent curriculum.
          </p>
<p>
           The new curriculum, shaped after the needs of the state, was approved by the Government on the 12th April 1979. Textbooks are written or selected in accordance with the newly framed curriculum were put into use for classes 9 and 10 from 1981 and 1982 respectively.
          </p>
<p>
           In 1986, a significant development marked the HSLC examination process with the introduction of centrally coded answer books for centralized evaluation. In 1988, the existing HSLC course was semesterised and bifurcated into two examinations, i.e. the Class 9 (Promotion) Examination, and the HSLC examination. With the onset of semesterisation, the supplementary examination was done away with.  From 1987 the system of conducting the supplementary examination in the middle of the year and immediately after the main examination was abolished.
          </p>
<p>
           The NBSE conducted the HSLC Examination 1988 on the new syllabus based on the national core curriculum.  The first Class-9 (Promotion) examination was held in 1988 at all the recognized schools. Classes-8 and 9 examinations were decentralized where the Board sets and supplies the question papers and the schools evaluate and declare the results as per the criteria laid down.
          </p>
<p>
           The 1994 batch of students of Class 8 and 9 were allotted registration numbers consequent upon their success at these examinations. The 1995 batch of students of Class 8 and 9 were issued pass certificates with registration numbers. This move made it easier for the Board to keep a track record of each student.
          </p>
<p>
           The NBSE ( Amendment ) Act 1990 empowers the Board to conduct the higher secondary school leaving certificate examination under the three streams- science, arts, and commerce.
