           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the following passage.
          </p>
<p>
           1. I saw ‘Jaws’, the popular shark movie, the summer it came out, in 1975 and became paranoid about sharks. Though I kept swimming after Jaws, it was always with the vague fear that a shark’s teeth could tug on my leg at any moment. Never mind that there’d been only two shark bites since 1900 on the Connecticut coast, where I lived.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           2. So, when I got this assignment for the National Geographic magazine, I decided to accept and do what I’d never wanted to do: swim with the sharks. I had to go to a place in the Bahamas known as Tiger Beach and dive with tiger sharks, the species responsible for more recorded attacks on humans than any shark except the great white. It was to be my first dive after getting certified-which meant it would be my first dive anywhere other than a swimming pool or a quarry-and without a diver’s cage. Most people who got wind of this plan thought I was either very brave or very stupid.
          </p>
<p>
           3. But I just wanted to puncture an illusion. The people who know sharks intimately tend to be the least afraid of them, and no one gets closer to sharks than divers. The divers who run operations at Tiger Beach speak lovingly of the tiger sharks the way people talk about their children or their pets. In their eyes, these sharks aren’t man-eaters any more than dogs are.
          </p>
<p>
           4. The business of puncturing illusions is never just black and white. My fellow divers had hundreds of dives under their belt and on the two-hour boat ride to the site in the morning of our first dive, they kept saying things like, ‘Seriously, I really can’t believe this is your first dive.’ All this was okay with me until I reached the bottom and immediately had to fend off the first tiger shark, I had ever laid eyes on. However, when I watched the other divers feeding them fish and steering them gently, it became easy to see the sharks in a very benign light.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           5. I think it would be unfair not to mention that though tiger sharks are apex predators. They act as a crucial balancing force in ocean ecosystems, constraining the numbers of animals like sea turtles and limit their behaviour by preventing them from overgrazing the sea grass beds. Furthermore, tiger sharks love warm water, they eat almost anything, have a huge litter and are the hardiest shark species. If the planet and its oceans continue to warm, some species will be winners and others will be losers and tiger sharks are likely to be winners. (443 words)

</p>
<p>
           Answer the following questions, based on the passage above:
          </p>
<p>
           (i) What does the use of the phrase ‘benign light’ suggest in the context of the writer’s viewpoint about the tiger sharks? (1)
           <br/>
           (a) Friendly nature of sharks
           <br/>
           (b) Baseless fear of sharks
           <br/>
           (c) Incorrect quality associated with sharks
           <br/>
           (d) All of these
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (d) All of these
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Cite a point in evidence, from the text, to suggest that the writer’s post-Jaws fear was not justified. (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The writer’s fear of sharks, after watching the movie Jaws, was a bit irrational and somewhat not justified as it is stated in the text that there were only two shark attacks reported from 1900 till after 1975. So, it was highly unlikely that he had to fear Sharks.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           (iii) People thought the writer was ‘either brave or very stupid’. Why did some people think that he was’very stupid’? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Some people thought that the author was very stupid because he side-lined the popular notion that tiger sharks are dangerous and was risking his life. He was walking into obvious danger without the required expertise and could be bitten by the sharks.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) Which one of the following traits of the writer is evident from lines 5-10? (1)
           <br/>
           (a) Bold
           <br/>
           (b) Adventurous
           <br/>
           (c) Experimental
           <br/>
           (d) All of these
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (d) All of these
          </p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
           (v) Why does the writer say that people who know sharks intimately tend to be least afraid of them? (2)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The writer says that the people who know sharks intimately tend to be least afraid of them because they find them to be harmless. They found that the sharks feed on the food they offer and seem to be as docile as pets.
          </p>
<p>
           (vi) Substitute the underlined word/phrase in the sentence with a word/phrase from the passage which means the same. (1)
           <br/>
           Some academicians think that reward, as a form of discipline, is a simple right or wrong issue.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Black and white
          </p>
<p>
           (vii) What do the tiger sharks love?
           <br/>
           (a) Eating turtles
           <br/>
           (b) Harming people who bother them
           <br/>
           (c) Warm water
           <br/>
           (d) Sea grass
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (c) Warm water
          </p>
<p>
           (viii) Complete the sentence appropriately. (1)
           <br/>
           The author of the given passage, wants the reader to …………………….
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           not fear sharks and understand the ecosystem
          </p>
<p>
           (ix) Complete the sentence appropriately. (1)
           <br/>
           The writer decides to swim with the sharks because ………………….
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           he wanted to puncture the illusion that sharks are vicious man-eating animals.
          </p>
<p>
           (x) State whether the given assertion is True or False. (1)
           <br/>
           Tiger sharks can be called apex predators because tiger sharks restrict the number of sea turtles by feeding on them and act as a balancing force in the ecosystem.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           True
          </p>

<p>
           Respectfully, I would like to inform you that I am Gaurav Sinha, a student of Class X-B in your school. I request you to change my section from B to A. The reason for this request is that all of my old friends are in another section and I am facing adjustment problems with my new classmates. Also, I do not feel comfortable in this section.
          </p>
<p>
           I hope you will consider my request as soon as possible.

           Question 4.
           <br/>
           You recently visited an art gallery and were extremely mesmerized by a piece of art. Describe that piece of art, the artist, and their artistic style in not more than 100 words. [4]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           My recent visit to an art gallery left me entranced by a captivating piece entitled “Ethereal Reverie” by the artist Isabella Kline. The artwork, a large canvas bathed in vivid hues of blues and purples, depicted a dreamlike landscape. Abstract yet evocative, it featured swirling, ethereal forms that seemed to dance across the canvas. Isabella Kline’s artistic style is a fusion of abstract expressionism and surrealism, creating a harmonious blend of emotion and imagination. “Ethereal Reverie” transported me to a realm of enchantment, where colors and shapes coalesced into a mesmerizing symphony of the artist’s boundless creativity.

           Sir/Ma’am
          </p>
<p>
           Through the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I want to highlight the fact that the need to reduce air pollution along with the availability of new advanced batteries has allowed Electric Vehicles (EVs) to appear as a clean alternative to internal combustion vehicles. Electric drive systems are virtually non-polluting and extremely energy efficient. While internal combustion vehicles can convert about 20% of the chemical energy in gasoline into useful work, 75% or more of the energy from a battery has productive power in an electric vehicle.
          </p>
<p>
           Numerous vehicles including three-wheelers, cars, and scooters on the road contribute to heavy air and noise pollution. The use of electric vehicles can also help us in saving foreign exchange worth crores and will also substantially reduce healthcare costs.
          </p>
<p>
           Therefore, people should try to use electricity-run vehicles which are energy efficient and environment friendly.

           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Title: Embracing Failure: A Stepping Stone to Personal Growth -by Shikha, English Teacher
           <br/>
           As we journey through life, the path to success is often paved with stumbling blocks and setbacks. It’s essential for us, as learners, to recognise that these obstacles are not roadblocks but rather stepping stones to personal growth. Failure, though daunting, holds a profound lesson in resilience and self-improvement.
           <br/>
           When we fear failure, we limit ourselves, often avoiding risks that might lead to great accomplishments. Mistakes, however, provide invaluable learning opportunities. Each stumble offers insights that pave the way for progress and innovation. Just as a caterpillar transforms into a butterfly through a process of struggle, we too transform and develop by confronting our shortcomings.
           <br/>
           Embracing failure fosters resilience and determination. It teaches us that setbacks are temporary, while the lessons learned endure. When we persevere through failures, we build character, courage, and a mindset that welcomes challenges with open arms.
           <br/>
           So, dear students, let’s change our perspective on failure. It’s not a mark of defeat but rather a badge of courage. Embracing mistakes empowers us to dream big, to learn, and to grow. Let’s not be afraid to stumble; let’s be proud of the lessons we glean from them. Remember, success is not about avoiding failure but about rising stronger every time we fall.

           (b) Earth Day Celebrations -By Akshika
           <br/>
           Earth Day, celebrated on April 22nd, is not merely a date on the calendar; it is a reminder of our duty to protect the planet we call home. At Brightland Public School, we believe that Earth Day should be celebrated everywhere because environmental issues affect us all, transcending borders and boundaries. In recent years, we’ve witnessed disasters like wildfires, floods,and hurricanes that have devastated our planet. These events are stark reminders of the consequences of our unsustainable actions.
           <br/>
           To promote Earth Day, our school initiated various eco-friendly campaigns. We organized tree-planting drives, encouraging students to become stewards of nature. We also conducted awareness sessions on reducing plastic usage, emphasizing the importance of recycling.
           <br/>
           Participating in these campaigns had a profound impact on me. I realized that small actions can create a big change. Earth Day isn’t just about one day of action; it’s about instilling a lifelong commitment to protect our environment.
           <br/>
           As we celebrate Earth Day, let’s remember that the preservation of our planet is everyone’s responsibility, and together, we can make a significant difference.

           Read the given excerpts and answer the questions briefly, for ANY TWO excerpts, of the three, given. 4+4=8
           <br/>
           (A) “Other creatures loathed his voice
           <br/>
           But, alas, they had no choice
           <br/>
           And the crass cacophony
           <br/>
           Blared out front the sumac tree.”
           <br/>
           (The Frog and The Nightingale)
           <br/>
           (i) What was the reaction of other creatures to the character’s voice, and why did they have no choice but to endure it? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Other creatures reacted to the character’s voice with a sense of loathing and dislike. Despite their distaste for the sound, they were compelled to tolerate it because they had no alternative option to escape from its presence.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Describe the nature of the sound that came from the sumac tree and its impact on the surroundings. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The sound emanating from the sumac tree was described as a “crass cacophony,” indicating that it was a harsh and jarring noise. This noise had a disruptive effect on the surroundings, disturbing the peaceful atmosphere and likely causing discomfort for any nearby creatures.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) In what manner did the creatures feel about the character’s voice, and how did their lack of options affect their situation? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Thecreatures heldanegativeopinionofthecharacter’s voice, viewing it with disdain. Unfortunately, they found themselves in a situation where they couldn’t avoid the unpleasantness of the sound because they lacked any other choice or alternative.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) Explain the role of the sumac tree in generating the disruptive noise and how it affected both the character and the environment. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The sumac tree played a significant role as the source of the disturbing noise that filled the environment. The blaring sound coming from the tree had a disruptive impact on both the character and the ecosystem, creating an atmosphere of discomfort and discord rather than tranquillity.
          </p>
<p>

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A reporter from a newspaper
          </p>
<p>
           (C) ‘Gainst death and all obvious enmity
           <br/>
           Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find a room,
           <br/>
           Even in the eyes of all posterity
           <br/>
           That wears this world out to the ending doom.
           <br/>
           (Not Marble, nor the Gilded Monuments)
           <br/>
           (i) What will the speaker continue to do despite facing death and enmity? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The speaker will continue to exist and be remembered despite facing death and enmity. The use of the word “pace forth” suggests that the speaker’s legacy will endure or move forward, even in the face of mortality and hostility.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Where will the speaker’s praise continue to be acknowledged? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The speaker’s praise will continue to be acknowledged “in the eyes of all posterity.” In other words, future generations will recognize and celebrate the speaker’s accomplishments and virtues.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Whose eyes will acknowledge the speaker’s praise according to the excerpt? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The speaker’s praise will be acknowledged by “all posterity.” This means that the recognition and admiration will come from people who come after the speaker’s time, the generations that follow.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) Until when will the speaker’s praise endure, as mentioned in the excerpt? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The speaker’s praise will endure to the ending doom suggesting that the speaker’s legacy will last until the very end of the world or the end of time itself, emphasising the timelessness of their praise and reputation.

          </p>
<p>
           (iv) Why did the albatross follow the ship and how did the sailors treat it? (The Rime of the Ancient Mariner) (2)

           Answer:
           <br/>
           Decius was more successful than Calpurnia in persuading Caesar as he appealed to Caesar’s vanity by telling him that the senators want to crown him. In contrast, Calpurnia only talks about her dreams. It seems that Caesar did not believe in superstitions and his vanity overcomes all persuasions by Calpurnia.

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Answer ANY ONE of the following two questions in about 150 words. [8]
           <br/>
           (A) In Stanley Houghton’s play ‘The Dear Departed,’ how does the author employ satire and irony to critique societal values and family dynamics surrounding death and inheritance? Provide specific examples from the play to support your answer.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           (B) Imagine that Patol Babu read about the boys, Nicola and Jacopo from ‘Two Gentlemen of Verona ‘ and feels inspired by their experiences and transformations in life. He is inspired to share his own story and offer advice to them.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (A) Stanley Houghton employs satire and irony in “The Dear Departed” to critique societal values and family dynamics linked to death and inheritance. The play comically exposes the family’s materialism and hypocrisy following the supposed passing of Mr. Abel Merry Weather. When they believe he’s dead, the family members outwardly mourn, yet their true motivations surface when they discover he’s alive. For instance, Mrs. Jordan expresses grief but swiftly switches to calculating her potential gains from his death. This satirizes the insincerity of their mourning.
           <br/>
           The family’s eagerness to claim Mr. Merry Weather’s possessions further highlights their self-centeredness. Despite their claims of unity, their hidden conflicts and self-interest become apparent as they scramble to secure the inheritance. The play’s irony lies in the title itself – “The Dear Departed” initially implies genuine affection, but the characters are “dear” to each other solely in terms of financial gain. Such instances of satire and irony not only provide comic relief but also offer a sharp critique of society’s materialistic values and the erosion of genuine familial bonds in the face of inheritance.
          </p>
<p>
           OR
          </p>
<p>
           (B) Dear Nicola and Jacopo,
           <br/>
           I hope this letter finds you well. I recently had the pleasure of reading about your adventures and transformations in ‘Two Gentlemen of Verona,’ and I couldn’t help but be inspired by your journey. Life often presents us with unexpected challenges and opportunities, and your story reminded me of my own experience.
           <br/>
           In my own life, I too faced unexpected turns and challenges. At a certain time, I found myself unexpectedly cast in a film role with just one dialogue. While it seemed insignificant at first, I realized that every opportunity, no matter how small, can be a chance for personal growth. I embraced the role with dedication and passion, and it turned out to be a truly rewarding experience.
           <br/>
           My advice to you both is this: embrace every challenge and opportunity that comes your way. Life has a way of surprising us, and it is in those moments that we discover our true potential. Keep an open heart and a positive attitude, and you will find that even the smallest roles in life can lead to great transformations.
           <br/>
           Wishing you both the best in your future adventures.
           <br/>
           Warm regards
           <br/>
           Patol Babu
          </p>
