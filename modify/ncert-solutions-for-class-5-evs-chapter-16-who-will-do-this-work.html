<span style="color: #993366;">
<strong>
             1.What kinds of work or jobs do people not want to do? Why?
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #339966;">
<strong>
             Ans.
            </strong>
</span>
           People do not want to do those works which are not challenging and which do not require much of mental ability. All the menial jobs like cleaning, sweeping, etc. come Under such category of jobs. People want to do a job which is challenging and well paying. People also want to earn respect in society.
          </p>
<p>
           2.So, who does this kind of work? Why do people do this kind of work that others do not want to do?
           <br/>
<span style="color: #339966;">
<strong>
             Ans.
            </strong>
</span>
           Poor and uneducated people do this kind of work. The poverty does not allow them to study beyond certain grades. Lack of education makes them unfit for doing most of the jobs. That is why these people have to do menial jobs.

<strong>
            Imagine
           </strong>
<br/>
<span style="color: #993366;">
<strong>
             1.What would happen if nobody did this work? If nobody cleared the garbage lying outside your school or your house for one week, then what would happen?
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #339966;">
<strong>
             Ans.
            </strong>
</span>
           If nobody would do this work then it will create problems for us. The garbage will get collected outside our school and houses. It will start giving bad smell due to the process of rotting. It could create epidemics also. The place, fqll of garbage, will look very ugly.
           <br/>
           Some other ways for cleaning, so that people would not have to do this work, are:
           <br/>
           Crane: Cranes can be used to lift huge amount of garbage. This also eliminates the need of garbage handling by hand.Dalao: The big dustbin in which garbage is collected is called Dalao. The garbage truck lifts the whole Dalao and takes it to the garbage dumping site.

           He always takes initiative to solve any problem faced by the people of my colony. For example; if the drains are clogged, he leads a team of like minder people to clear the drain.

           No, there are people who look differently at different kinds of work. Some people have yet to change their mindset.
           <br/>
           – It is important to bring change because of several reasons. Every work is
           <br/>
           important for the society. A simple job does not mean that it is useless. Every person has self-respect and people should learn to pay respect to others no matter which kind of work they are doing.

<br/>
<span style="color: #339966;">
<strong>
             Ans.

</span>
           The meaning of these lines is as follows:
           <br/>
           An ideal person is one who understands the pain of others. An ideal person is willing to bear insult to remove sorrow from other person’s life. While doing all this, an ideal person should not have an iota of ego in his mind.

            What We Have Learnt

<strong>
             1.Gandhiji used to say that every person should do every kind of work. What do you feel about this? If everyone followed this, what are the things that would change? What are some changes that will happen in your own house?
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #339966;">
<strong>
             Ans.
            </strong>
</span>
           I think, Gandhiji was right that every person should do every kind of work. By doing a work we can understand the importance of that work and can also understand all the effort required for that work. If everyone followed this, then people will start showing more respect to others. We will understand that everyone is important for the society. In my house, I think everyone will start gaining the same amount of self respect.
