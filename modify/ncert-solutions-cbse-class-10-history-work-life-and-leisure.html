<strong>
            Q.1. Give three reasons why the population of London expanded from the middle of the eighteenth century.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            [CBSE 2008 ID). Sept. 2010. 2011]
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
            <br/>
</strong>
           By 1750, the population of London was about 675,000. Its population, however, continued to expand. Between 1810 and 1880 it increased from 1 million to about 4 million. ”
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
<strong>
            The reasons for this increase were as given below :
           </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
             Migrant populations:
            </strong>
            London was a powerful magnet for migrant populations. Even though it did not have large factories. Historian Gareth Stedman Jones says, “Nineteenth-century London was a city of clerks and shopkeepers, of small masters and skilled artisans, of a growing number of semi-skilled and sweated out workers, of soldiers and servants, of casual labourers, street sellers and beggars”.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Dockyards and industries:
            </strong>
            Apart from the London dockyards, there were five major industries – clothing and footwear, wood and furniture, metals and engineering, printing and stationery, and precision products such as surgical instruments, watches, and objects of precious metal. These industries attracted large number of people.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             World War I:
            </strong>
            During the First World War (1914-18) London began manufacturing motor cars and electrical goods. The number of large factories increased and ultimately they accounted for nearly one-third of all jobs in the city.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
            Q.2. What were the changes in the kind of work available to women in London between the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries? Explain the factors which led to this change.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
            <br/>
</strong>
           (i) Employment in Factories: In the 18th and the 19th centuries, a large number of women were employed in the factories because, during that period, most of the production activities were carried with the help of the family.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Technological Developments and loss of jobs: But with technological advancement, women gradually lost their industrial jobs and were forced to do household work. They also tried to increase the family income by activities like tailoring, washing or matchbox making.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           (iii) Employment during War: However, in the 20th century, women again started getting employed in wartime industries and offices because most of the male citizens were fighting at the front.

            Q.3. How does the existence of a large urban population affect each of the following? Illustrate with historical examples.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            (a) A private landlord.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            (b) A Police Superintendent in charge of law and order.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            (c) A leader of a political party.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
            <br/>
</strong>
<strong>
            (a) A private landlord:
           </strong>
           The existence of a large urban population enables a private landlord to earn more and more money. For example, after the Industrial Revolution, the increase in the migrant population in London led to housing problems. Factory owners did not house the migrant workers. Under such conditions, private landlords took advantage of the situation. They put up cheap and usually unsafe tenements for the new arrivals to earn money quickly. A tenement was run-down and often overcrowded apartment house, especially in a poor section of a large city.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
<strong>
            (b) A Police Superintendent in charge of law and order:
           </strong>
           The existence of a large urban population creates law and order problems for a Police Superintendent. For example, the population of London increased from 675,000 in 1750 to four million in 1880. At that time i.e., in the 1870s, there were about 20,000 criminals in the city. It was a great problem and the police was worried about this. Crime had become an object of widespread concern. Philanthropists were anxious about public morality, and industrialists wanted a hardworking and orderly labour force. In such a situation the job of the Police Superintendent incharge of law and order was tough.
          </p>
<p>
           Thus in order to control the situation, the population of criminals was counted. Their activities were watched, and their ways of life were investigated. Not only criminals, children of poor families too became thieves because crime was more profitable than labouring in small underpaid or low paid factories. Poor adults also resorted to petty thieving. Thus, the existence of large urban population creates many problems for a Superintendent of Police incharge of law and order and he has to work hard to control the situation.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            (c) A leader of a political party:
           </strong>
           A large population affects a leader of a political party., because he is representative of the people and is supposed to protect their interests. A large 5 population means more problems and more and more involvement of leader in those problems. It is both a threat and an opportunity. It may lead to strikes and riots as had happened in London i in 1886 and 1888. Political leaders in the government or outside the government support or oppose the mass agitations in their own interest or in the interest of the people. The leaders have to see and save the interests of the people cautiously in order to remain popular among the population/voters of the constituency.
          </p>

<strong>
            Q.4. Give explanations for the following :
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            (a) Why did the well off Londoners support the need to build housing for the poor in the nineteenth century?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            (b) Why were a number of Bombay films about the lives of migrants?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            (c) What led to the major expansion of Bombay’s population in the mid-nineteenth century?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans
           </strong>
           .
           <br/>
<strong>
            (a) Well-off Londoners supported the need to build housing for the poor in the nineteenth century due to the following reasons :
           </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
             Threat to public health:
            </strong>
            The poor were living in one-room houses which were over¬crowded. These houses were badly ventilated and lacked sanitation. Thus, these houses were a threat to public health.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Fire hazards:
            </strong>
            There were worries about fire hazards created by poor housing. In case of a fire, it was difficult to control it due to overcrowding of the area.
           </li>
<li>
<strong>
             Social order:
            </strong>
            There was fear of social disorder among the poor, especially after the Russian Revolution in 1917. Many of the criminals were in fact poor people who met their needs
            <br/>
            by stealing and other methods. As the areas of one-room houses of the poor were overcrowded, it was easy for the criminals or petty thieves to commit the crimes.
            <br/>
            Thus, under these circumstances, the need to build houses for the poor was supported by the well-off Londoners in the nineteenth century.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           (b) A number of Bombay films were about the lives of migrants because most of the people in the film industry were themselves migrants who came from cities like Lahore, Calcutta and Madras. They contributed to the national character of the industry. Those who came from Lahore, then in Punjab, were especially important for the development of the Hindi film industry. Many famous writers like Ismat Chughtai and Saadat Hasan Manto, were associated with Hindi cinema. These migrants knew the problems of people coming to Bombay and tried to highlight the same in the films that dealt with their encounters with the real pressures of daily life as well as contradictory aspects of the city. For example, in the film CID (1956) the hero sings, ‘Ai dil hai muskil jeena yahan; zara hatke zara bachke, ye hai Bombay merijaan.’ It means ‘My heart, it is difficult to live here! Move over a little, take care of yourself! This is Bombay my love!’

          </p>
<p>
           (iii) The city of London attracted people from all walks of life like clerks, shopkeepers, soldiers, servants, labourers, beggars, etc.
          </p>
<p>
           (iv) The living conditions in London changed dramatically when people started migrating from the countryside to the city in search of jobs. This was largely because accommodation was not provided to the labourers by the factory owners.

           (vi) Poverty was clearly visible in the city. In 1887, Charles Booth conducted a survey, and concluded that about one million landowners were very poor, and were expected to live only upto an average age of 29. These people were more likely to die in a workhouse, hospital or a lunatic asylum. Meanwhile, the city had extended beyond the range where people could walk to work. So the planners realised the need for a means of transport.
          </p>
<p>

Some said that the city of Paris had been monstrously transformed. Some lamented the passing of an earlier way of life and the development of upper-class culture.
