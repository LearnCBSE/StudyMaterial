<p>
           Question 2.(i)
           <br/>
           What do you understand by population composition?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           People of any country are diverse in many respects. Each person is unique in his own way. People can be distinguished by their age, sex and their place of residence. The entire gamut of people residing in a particular place along with their growth, distribution and variety may be termed as its population composition.

</div>
<p>
           Question 2.(ii)
           <br/>
           What is the significance of age-structure?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Age structure represents the number of people of different age groups. This is an important indicator of population composition, since a large size of population in the age group of 15-59 indicates a large working population. A greater proportion of population above 60 years represents an ageing population which requires more expenditure on health care facilities. Similarly high proportion of young population would mean that the region has a high birth rate and the population is youthful.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 2(iii)
           <br/>
           How is sex ratio measured?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Sex ratio in the world is calculated as number of males per thousand of females in a population.
           <br/>
           Sex ratio = (No. of males)/(No. of females) × lOOO
           <br/>
           In countries like India sex ratio is calculated as number of females per thousand of males.
           <br/>
           Sex ratio = (No. of females)/ (No. of males) × 1000
          </p>
<p>
           3. Answer the following questions in not more than 150 words:
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           Question 3.(i)
           <br/>
           Describe the rural-urban composition of the population.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The division of population into rural and urban is based on the residence. This division is necessary because rural and urban life styles differ from each other in terms of livelihood and social conditions. The age-sex-occupational structure, density of population and level of development vary between rural and urban population is also dependent on the state of development of a countiy.
          </p>
<p>
           The more progressed a country is with respect to its development, more number of people are engaged in non-primary activities, thus leading to shift from rural areas to urban areas. Moreover, industrialization also makes headway into the rural countryside, constructing new towns in hitherto traditionally agrarian areas, and therefore the population that was originally rural, becomes urban now. The criterion for classifying settlement as rural or urban varies from country to country. In general terms in rural areas more people are engaged in primary activities whereas in urban areas majority of population is associated with secondary or tertiary sectors.
          </p>
<p>
           The sex composition of rural and urban settlements varies between developed and developing countries. In the developed countries like the Western European nation due to security and availability of jobs women move out to urban areas. Farming is mostly mechanized there hence men tend to stay in rural areas and look after farming activities. Whereas a completely contrary picture can be seen in developing countries like India where due to lack of security, housing, job opportunities females tend to stay back in rural areas and look after farming whereas male members move out to urban areas in search of working opportunities,
          </p>
<p>
           Question 3.(iii)
           <br/>
           Discuss the factors responsible for imbalances in the sex-age found in different parts of the world and occupational structure.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The factors responsible for imbalances in the sex-age found in different parts of the world with focus on occupational structure are as follows:
          </p>
<p>
           The working population (in the age group of 15-59) takes part in various occupations ranging from agriculture, forestry, fishing, manufacturing, construction, commercial transport, services, communication and other unclassified services, being employed in the four sectors of the economy.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           That work force is a clear indicator of the level of development, particularly economic and social development. This is because only a developed economy with industries and infrastructure can accommodate more workers in the secondary, tertiary and quaternary sector. If the economy is still in the primitive stages, then the proportion of people engaged in primary activities would be high as it involves extraction of natural resources. Moreover, the age structure of a country also is an indicator of the level of development. A large working population shows the progress of a nation, and a large dependent population of children and retired citizens show a burden on the economy of the country, dragging its developmental processes down. A higher participation of women in the secondary, tertiary and quaternary sectors also is a strong indicator of the progress of a nation.
          </p>

           The sex composition of rural and urban settlements varies between developed and developing countries. In the developed countries like the Western European nation due to security and availability of jobs women move out to urban areas. Farming there is mostly mechanized hence men tend to stay in rural areas and look after farming activities. Whereas a completely contrary picture can be seen in developing countries like India where due to lack of security, housing, job opportunities, females tend to stay back in rural areas and look after farming whereas male members move out to urban areas in search of working opportunities.

           Question 1.
           <br/>
           What does the literacy rate of a country indicate?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Proportion of literate population of a country is an indicator of its socio¬economic development as it reveals the standard of living, social status of females, availability of educational facilities and policies of government. Level of economic development is both a cause and consequence of literacy.

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Why is unfavorable female sex ratio found in India and other South Asian countries?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In India and South Asian countries, female sex ratio is low due to:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Widespread gender discrimination
           </li>
<li>
            High mortality rate of female child during birth.
           </li>
<li>
            Lower social-economic status of women.
           </li>
<li>
            High female infant mortality due to negligence and lack of medical facilities.
           </li>
<li>
            Preference to male child which results in high female foeticide and female infanticide.

           <br/>
           What do you mean by natural advantage and social disadvantage?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Females have a biological advantage over males as they tend to be more resilient than males. This is called Natural Advantage. Social disadvantage is that women are not preferred as a child in the society and people have a preference for a male child. The natural advantage is cancelled by the social disadvantage and discrimination against women.

<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           How does sex ratio give important information about status of women in a country?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In regions where gender discrimination is rampant, the sex ratio is bound to be unfavorable to women. Such areas are those where the practice of female foeticide, female infanticide and domestic violence against women are prevalent. One of the reasons could be lower social-economic status of women in these areas. You must remember that more women in the population does not mean they have a better status. It could be that the men might have migrated to other areas for employment.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Describe the world pattern of sex ratio.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           On an average, the world population reflects a sex ratio of 102 males per 100 females. The highest sex ratio in the world has been recorded in Latvia where there are 85 males per 100 females. In contrast, in Qatar there are 311 males per 100 females. The world pattern of sex ratio does not exhibit variations in the developed regions of the world. The sex ratio is favorable for females in 139 countries of the world and unfavorable for them in the remaining 72 countries listed by the United Nations. In general, Asia has a low sex ratio. Countries like China, India, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Afghanistan have a lower sex ratio.
           <br/>
           On the other extreme is greater part of Europe (including Russia) where males are in minority. A deficit of males in the populations of many European countries is attributed to better status of women, and an excessive male-dominated out-migration to different parts of the world in the past.

<p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           How is occupational structure a good indicator of levels of economic development of a nation?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The working population (i.e. women and men of the age group – 15 to 59) take part in various occupations ranging from agriculture, forestry, fishing, manufacturing construction, commercial transport, services, communication and other unclassified services. Agriculture, forestry, fishing and mining are classified as primary activities manufacturing as secondary, transport, communication and other services as tertiary and the jobs related to research and developing ideas as quaternary activities.
          </p>
<p>
           The proportion of working population engaged in these four sectors is a good indicator of the levels of economic development of a nation. This is because only a developed economy with industries and infrastructure can accommodate more workers in the secondary, tertiary and quaternary sector. If the economy is still in the primitive stages, then the proportion of people engaged in primary activities world be high as it involves extraction of natural resources.

<br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The above figure shows rural urban sex composition of selected countries. The rural and urban differences in sex ratio in Canada and West European countries like Finland are just the opposite of those in African and Asian countries like Zimbabwe and Nepal respectively. In Western countries, males outnumber females in rural areas and females outnumber the males in urban areas.
          </p>
<p>
           In countries like Nepal, Pakistan and India the case is reverse. The excess of females in urban areas of U.S.A., Canada and Europe is the result of influx of females from rural areas to avail of the vast job opportunities. Farming in these developed countries is also highly mechanized and remains largely a male occupation. By contrast the sex ratio in Asian urban areas remains male dominated due to the predominance of male migration. It is also worth noting that in countries like India, female participation in farming activity in rural area is fairly high. Shortage of housing, high cost of living, paucity of job opportunities and lack of security in cities, discourage women to migrate from rural to urban areas.

           Describe the main characteristics each of the major groups of human occupations in the world. (CBSE 2006, 2007, 2011)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The working population of a country (between age group 15-59 years), who take part in various occupations ranging from agriculture, forestry, fishing, manufacturing, commercial activities, transport services etc. is called occupational structure. Four major group of occupations are:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Primary occupation: Depends fully on nature. Example; agriculture, forestry, fishing, and mining etc.
           </li>
<li>
            Secondary occupation: People engaged in manufacturing. Example; industries.
           </li>
<li>
            Service sectors: Transport and communication. Example; trade and commerce, teaching etc.
           </li>
<li>
            Quaternary occupation: Job related to research and developing ideas etc. Example; computing, consultancy, etc. The proportion of working population engaged in these four sectors is a poor indicator of the levels of economic development of a nation.
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           What is the impact of rural-urban migration on the age and sex structure on the place of origin and destination? (CBSE 2018)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Migration leads to redistribution of population within a country. Rural-urban migration is one of the important factors contributing to the population growth of cities. Age and skill selective out migration from rural areas have adverse effect on rural demographic structure. High out migration results in serious imbalance in age-sex composition. Male population within the working age group migrate out of rural areas leaving females, children and old aged people, which increases the share of dependent population in rural areas.
          </p>
<p>
           The situation is especially difficult for females because they have to look after both domestic and economic work in the villages, leading to higher participation of women in agriculture without decrease in their household workload. Also it leads to loss of human resource from the rural areas, leaving them with unskilled people thus reducing the total productivity and hence hampering the development of rural areas.
           <br/>
           Urban areas receive heavy in migration of working age male population, causing sex ratio to be highly unfavourable for females, which gives rise to crimes against women and increases their vulnerability.
