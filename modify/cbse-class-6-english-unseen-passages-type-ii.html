            Passage 1
           </strong>
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           1 Soon the drum made of tamarind wood was ready. The courtiers as¬sembled outside the king’s door and the royal musician began to play. But instead of the thum thum thum that everyone expected, the Tamarind drum intoned, The raja has horns on his head. The raja has horns on his head.’ The court burst out laughing and the king cried with rage.
          </p>
<p>
           2 ‘I won’t stay in the palace a moment longer,’ he shouted. ‘I’ll go to the forest and live by myself.’ He tore the nightcap off his head and ran out of the palace, seizing the Tamarind drum on his way out.
          </p>
<p>
           3 The king lived for several years in the forest. He gradually learnt about the beauty of the world around him. He learnt to care for creatures smaller than himself. He grew strong and wise and selfless. His only companion was the Tamarind drum, and the drum, when he beat it, gave him all the advice and experience of the old tree. He learnt to play it so beautifully that even the spirits of the trees were charmed and they went to meet the god who had given him the horns.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           4 ‘Forgive him’, they begged. ‘He has changed. Remove his horns and give him back his kingdom.
           <br/>
           5 The god waved his hands and the horns disappeared
          </p>
<p>
           6 Next morning the king went down to a forest pool to drink water. While cupping his hands he saw his reflection, and his lean sun-tanned face looked back at him—without any horns! And, as he sat up in surprise, several horse-riders burst into the clearing, and he saw his courtiers. They knelt before him. ‘Your majesty, forgive us and come back. The kingdom needs you.’
          </p>
<p>
           7 The king went back to his kingdom. He kept his Tamarind drum beside him always and he ruled wisely. And yes, the barber kept his head, but lost his job !

            Passage 2
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           1 The unique attempt was made on 28 July 1992. ‘My fight’, said Janaki, ‘in the course of the swim was against nature. The Channel waters were so cold that I needed much more energy than usual to keep my arms moving. Then I had the problem of my legs moving to the left or to the right, whichever way the waves were moving. So I really needed a lot of energy. The water was very salty, and when it entered my mouth I felt sick. And then there were the seaweeds and jelly fish. These fish kept sticking to my body and I felt very uncomfortable. ’
          </p>
<p>
           2 However, despite these problems, Janaki successfully completed her share of the relay : She swam for about two hours and helped the relay team cross the 36 km Channel in 14 hours and 45 minutes.
          </p>
<p>
           3 Janaki’s parents, Mr Nagappa and Mrs Indiramma, had anxiously stood on the Dover beach, wondering how things would turn out. ‘We could not eat a morsel,’ said Mr Nagappa. ‘How could we when our daughter was doing something so dangerous? For us old people it was really veiy ago¬nizing.’ But their daughter did triumph, becoming the first handicapped swimmer to part-swim the English Channel.
          </p>
<p>
           4 After her success Janaki said, ‘Although I couldn’t swim solo, I’m nev-ertheless happy that I was part of a relay team that helped me fulfil my dream of swimming the English Channel. I would now like to start train¬ing for the Paraplegic Olympics.’
          </p>
<p>
           5 Janaki, who is a bank officer in Bangalore, has a simple philosophy: ‘I have always wanted to do something worthwhile in life. I strongly believe that the word “Impossible” is applied to something that has not been tried. I wanted to prove that to be handicapped is no bar to success. One can overcome all obstacles by hard work, determination, courage, and self-reliance. Self-reliance is very important. God helps those who help themselves. Lastly, there is one more thing I would like to say : there is really no short-cut to success !’

            Passage 3
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           1 Mayuri’s success encouraged him to dub the film in Tamil and Malayalam and remake it in Hindi as NacheMayuri, and Sudha Chandran made her debut—as a film star. She has since acted in many films in several languages, and has produced a Kannada film, Kcdabhimani, based on the true life of Balanna, a deaf artiste who went on to become a great character actor. (Balanna, 74, has 400 Kannada films to his credit.)
          </p>
<p>
           2 Sudha’s success was followed by invitations for shows from all over the world. She has danced in several European countries, Canada, and the Middle East. A few years ago she went to the United States on an eight-performance tour around the country. She remembers a young girl who, after the Washington concert, struggled through the crowds around the dancer, and with tears streaming down her .face, silently handed her a card that read, ‘Congratulations. You have made it!’
          </p>
<p>
           3 Did the audience know her story everywhere ? ‘No, not everywhere. In fact, at some of the performances, people learned about it only during the interval and after that there would be a wonderful, heartwarming response. But then they have had their heroes too. Did any of them ac¬cept defeat ? Like them, I have also believed in asking, “What next ?’’ rather than “Why me ?” If Helen Keller could overcome her handicap, so can I. That is what I have always told myself.’
          </p>
<p>
           4 That, Sudha remarks, is what she replied to her Indian fans, thousands of whom wrote to her after the release of her films. ‘People wrote to say that they were inspired by my story and that it had given them new hope. I do feel thrilled that my message has got across.’
          </p>
<p>
           5 And what is that message ?
           <br/>
           6 The seed of achievement lies in the human mind. When this realiza¬tion comes, there is no looking back. Once I decided that my handicap was not going to stop me from dancing, that was it.’

            Passage 4
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           1 If the elephant was doing nothing when Karim’s wife had water to fetch, or dinner to cook, either she or Karim would draw a circle in the dust in front of the tethered animal, and put the baby into it.
          </p>
<p>
           2 ‘Keep him inside that, O Lord of Elephants,’ they would order the big tusker, who gently stopped the child if he tried to crawl away.
          </p>
<p>
           3 One afternoon when they were camped near the Rapti River, Karim’s wife took a big earthen jar and went off towards the river to fill it. After a while, when she failed to return, Karim shouted in the direction she had taken. But there was no reply.
          </p>
<p>
           4 Quite suddenly Karim, with his heel, marked a circle in front of the elephant and put the baby in it.
           <br/>
           5 ‘Look after him, Gajpati !’
           <br/>
           6 He ran to see what had happened to his wife.
          </p>
<p>
           7 Under Gajpati’s trunk, next to his immense toenails, the baby lay and laughed up at the elephant. The infant could do as he liked, But each time he tried to crawl out of the circle he was picked up and put back in again. Gajpati scooped up some dust with his trunk and blew it over him. Sometimes he flicked a little dirt over the baby to discourage flies. And sometimes drops of green spit fell from Gajpati’s pointed underlip onto the baby’s tummy and tickled him. They were perfectly content to¬gether, these two.
          </p>
<p>
           8 Suddenly the sun was gone, drawing over it a sky of velvet and dia¬monds. Immediately, the air was colder, and the baby began to ciy. Jackals howled in the dusk, and there came the whoop of an eagle owl.
          </p>
<p>
           9 Not far away, in the rough grassland, a male hyena emerged from his burrow and stood silently sniffing the night air for news of food. He was a scavenger of dead flesh and an eater of skeletons. He would also pick up any small, helpless creature he might find. In India, hyenas carry away human children every year.

            Passage 5
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           1 About thirty years ago, while travelling and teaching in Turkey, Nepal and Iran, Bonnie Bergin noticed self-sufficient handicapped people going about their unremarkable daily business, often using burros and donkeys to hold pots, pans and other wares to be sold. She later returned to the United States to begin work on a Master’s Degree in Special Education.
          </p>
<p>
           2 “I thought hard about what can be done to get people out ‘of institutions and onto the streets, getting jobs, and it came to me—dogs,” says Bergin, who today has a Doctorate in Education and is founder of the Assistance Dog Institute and originator of the service-dog concept.
          </p>
<p>
           3 She ran into fierce resistance from academics and professionals at first. Dogs spread disease. Dogs are stupid. The disabled can’t take care of dogs, how can dogs take care of them ? But the long list of negative reactions didn’t stop her. Her first trainee was Abdul, a golden retriever puppy someone had given her.
          </p>
<p>
           4 Her first dog-assistance client was Kerry Knaus, a soft-spoken 19-year- old woman who had a neuromuscular disorder that had left her unable to move her legs and much of her arms. Bergin and Knaus concentrated not on physical gestures but on verbal cues such as “sit” or “stay”, using variations in tone of voice and facial expressions to get Abdul to help Knaus.
          </p>
<p>
           5 By the end of the training the dog could push Knaus up from her in¬chair falls, open doors, turn on lights, retrieve food and push levers to help her operate the chair and also lift it to her van. Most important, Knaus had to develop a trusting emotional bond with Abdul simply by spending time with him, much in the way humans get to know one an¬other and develop a relationship based on mutual understanding.

            Passage 6
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           1 “A scrubbing pail, ” She said vexed. “A Mother’s Day gift of a scrubbing pail.” Her voice almost broke.
           <br/>
           2 Tears sprang to Nick’s eyes. Without a word he picked up the scrub¬bing pail and mop and blindly trudged down the stairs. I put the comb in my pocket and ran after him. He was crying and I felt so bad I began to cry, too. On the way down we met Father. Nick could not talk, so I ex¬plained.
           <br/>
           3 “I will take it back,” sobbed Nick.
           <br/>
           4 “No,” said Father firmly, taking the pail. “It is a fine gift. A wonderful gift. I should have thought of it myself. Women sometimes don’t see how to escape their burdens. They escape in pretty baubles rather than lighter work.”
           <br/>
           5 We all went upstairs again, Nick climbing very reluctantly. Inside the kitchen, Mother was still scrubbing, but not vigorously. Slowly, sadly.
           <br/>
           6 Without a word Father soaked the puddle of dirty water up with the mop and using the foot wringer on the bucket, neatly squeezed it dry.
           <br/>
           7 “You did not let Nick finish,” he said sternly.
           <br/>
           8 “Part of his gift was that he was going to wash the floor from now on.” He looked at Nick. “Isn’t that so, Nick ?”
           <br/>
           9 With a flush of shame Nick understood the lesson. “Yes, oh, yes,” he said in a low, eager tone.
           <br/>
           10 Quickly, repentantly, Mother said, “It is too heavy work for a fourteen- year-old boy.”
           <br/>
           11 It was then I realised how smart Father was. “Ah,” he said cunningly. “Not with this wonderful wringer and scrub pail. It’s much easier. Your hands stay clean, and your knees don’t hurt.” Again Father demonstrated quickly.
           <br/>
           12 Mother said, looking sadly at Nick, “Ah, a woman can become so stu¬pid.” She kissed Nick and he felt better. Then they turned to me.
           <br/>
           13 “Where is your gift?” asked Father. Nick looked at me and paled. I felt the comb in my pocket. It would make the scrubbing pail again a scrub¬bing pail compared with a comb with shining stones just like diamonds.
           <br/>
           14 “Half the scrubbing pail,” I said mournfully, and Nick looked at me with love in his eyes.

            Passage 7
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           1 The grand fare was set before the friend and Moti Lai waited in agonis¬ing silence. Today surely, his friend would not say that it did not com¬pare with the feasts of his village. With the great variety of food served, dinner took a long time.
          </p>
<p>
           2 At last the friend spoke, “Today, your food, dear Moti, was fit for the table of a king. But still, it cannot compare with the feasts I have at home.’’
          </p>
<p>
           3 Moti Lai nearly dropped down in disappointment. What were the feasts of his friend’s village like ? How lavish were they that the rich fare of his valley could not even compare with them ?
          </p>
<p>
           4 At lunch the next day, the food was so delicious that passers-by stopped and licked their lips at just the smell of it. Moti Lai bit his lips nervously. Yet once again Kisan Lai’s response was, “I would really have said that the food today was incomparable had I not tasted the feasts at home.”
          </p>
<p>
           5 Moti Lai silently acknowledged defeat and for the rest of Kisan Lai’s stay, though he always had the best of food served, he no longer tried to compete with the food Kisan ate in his village. Eventually, Kisan Lai went away.
          </p>
<p>
           6 The years rolled by. One winter. Moti Lai decided to leave his snow¬bound land for a while to enjoy the warmer climate of the plains. He decided to visit his friend. It would be a good opportunity, he felt, to taste the famous feasts of Kisan’s village and their feasts had never really left Moti Lai’s thoughts.
          </p>
<p>
           7 Kisan Lai was delighted to see his friend after so many years. “Do stay and rest here awhile”, he said and Moti Lai willingly accepted.
          </p>
<p>
           8 That evening Moti Lai spent the hours in great expectation. Dinner was served. A servant brought in two plates. Rotis, a bowl of curd, salad, dal and a plate of vegetables was all that had been served. Then the servant departed. Moti Lai waited expectantly. The servant did not reappear. His friend turned to him and said, “Please start your meal.” Moti Lai gulped down the food without a word. He told himself to be patient. Surely, tomorrow the delicacies of the village would be served to him, he thought.

            Passage 8
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           1 ‘We continued on our way, when the tiger again came out into the nullah; and this time, as it stood and looked at us, it was growling and twitching its tail. We again stood quite still, and after a time the tiger quietened down and left the nullah. A little later a number of jungle fowl rose cack¬ling out of the dense scrub, evidently disturbed by the tiger, and one of – them came and sat on a tree right in front of us. As the bird alighted on a branch in full view of us, Har Singh said he would shoot it and so avoid going home empty-handed. He added that the shot would frighten away the tiger, and before I could stop him he had fired.’
          </p>
<p>
           2 ‘Next second there was a terrifying roar as the tiger came towards us crashing through broken branches. At this spot there were some rani trees growing on the edge of the nullah, and I dashed towards one while Har Singh dashed towards another. My tree was nearer the tiger, but before it arrived I had climbed out of reach. Har Singh had not learnt to climb trees when he was a boy, as I had. He was still standing on the ground, reaching up and trying to grasp a branch, when the tiger, after leaving me, sprang at him. Har Singh was screaming and the tiger was roaring. I had taken my gun into the tree with me, so now I fired the gun off into the air. On hearing the shot so close to it, the tiger bounded away, and Har Singh collapsed at the foot of the tree.’
          </p>
<p>
           3 ‘When the tiger had been gone some time, I climbed down very silently, and went to Har Singh. I found that one of the tiger’s claws had entered his stomach and torn the lining from his navel to within a few fingers’ breadth of the backbone, and that all his insides had fallen out. I was in great trouble. I could not run away and leave Har Singh. I did not know what to do with his intestines, not having any experience in these mat¬ters. Har Singh told me to put them back into his stomach. I stuffed them all back, including the dry leaves and grass and twigs that were sticking to them. After I had done that I wound my pugree round his stomach, knotting it tight to keep everything from falling out again. Then we set out on the seven-mile walk to our village, myself in front, carrying the two guns, while Har Singh walked behind.’

            Passage 9
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           1 The rate at which forests are disappearing on the Himalayan range is so rapid that this flourishing mountain chain could be reduced to a stark, denuded landscape by the first half of the next century. The Kulu valley, once bedecked by deodars, some 150 feet in height and 10 feet or more in girth, has almost been stripped bare. Much of central and western India, formerly criss-crossed by flowing rivers and lakes, bears an eerie resemblance to a lunar landscape. And Cherapunji, the wettest spot on earth, where dense subtropical forests once stood sentinel, is today gaunt and scarred.
          </p>
<p>
           2 Does this sound like a nightmare ? Indeed, one wishes it were so! Un-fortunately, the truth is that 6 million hectares of agricultural land in the world is being lost each year to the desert and another 21 million hec¬tares is reduced to a state of near complete uselessness, threatening the livelihoods of 1.2 billion people worldwide.
          </p>
<p>
           3 Right now in India itself, 53 percent of the total land area is heading towards devastation. The implications are horrifying.
          </p>
<p>
           4 The main reason behind this ugly disfigurement of fertile land is not poor rainfall but human error. In the name of progress, trees have been cut down for housing, for heating and cooking, to produce paper, and to make way for more agricultural land. Vast tracts of thick luxuriant forests have been destroyed, together with their root systems which hold the soil together and retain, its precious moisture. In the rainy season, water spills down the slopes as there are no roots left in the soil to absorb it. It washes away tonnes of fertile topsoil. The rivers turn muddy and the level of their beds rise, creating floods which cause destruction of property and human life. It is the erosion of Himalayan topsoil that is creating a new island in the Bay of Bengal !

            Passage 10
           </strong>
</p>
<p>
           1 I straightened my shoulders and followed Rahul’s dad wishing for the hundredth time that my dad was more like him.
           <br/>
           2 “Sorry,” said the Ranger, “regulations, you know. Have to kill the tiger without our elephants. Don’t want a man-eater here, do we ?”
           <br/>
           3 Back at the ravine we searched for the tiger’s pugmarks. The jungle was quiet, too quiet. Even the shrill twanging of the cicadas had stopped. Goose pimples formed on my arms. I could feel an odd prickling in the nape of my neck as if someone was following me stealthily. I looked over my left shoulder, there was nothing.
           <br/>
           4 “Blood”, said a tracker, “Look ! The grass is flattened. Tiger’s been sitting here. Can’t be far off now.”
           <br/>
           5 Something rustled in the undergrowth. I jumped, my heart thudding and thumping.
           <br/>
           6 ‘Tiger”, whispered Rahul sidling up to his dad.
           <br/>
           7 We started shouting, clapping, prodding with sticks to flush the tiger out. But it was only a frightened buffalo.
           <br/>
           8 ‘Tigers can travel very fast even when wounded. He could be miles away by now. I suggest we go back and tell the Ranger we can’t find the tiger. Besides, it’s too dangerous with the boys around.” said Dad.
           <br/>
           9 That was just like Dad; never wanting action.
           <br/>
           10 The sua was, low over the hohmre Startled, I looked around nervously. Two bright eyes stared at me from the thicket. I stood absolutely still, my heart banging against my ribs. The eyes did a little jig. I took a deep breath; they were just fireflies.
           <br/>
           11 I looked longingly at the nearby forest track wishing a jeep would sud¬denly materialise like in a magic show. So we wouldn’t have to walk back. I blinked. My heart started beating crazingly like a drum. My stomach somersaulted ; sweat poured down my face. A voice that didn’t sound like mine screamed. “The tiger! The tiger !”
           <br/>
           12 The tiger was charging straight at me. Out of the comer of my eye I saw the gun shaking in Mr Mullick’s hands. The tiger took a great big leap. Bang! Something whistled past my right ear. The tiger dropped in its track, dead.
           <br/>
           13 “My God, man ! I don’t know how you did it”, Rahul’s dad kept saying to my dad.
