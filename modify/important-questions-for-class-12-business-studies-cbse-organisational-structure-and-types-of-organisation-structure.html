<strong>
            Functional structure
           </strong>
           Under functional structure, an organisation is divided into different departments or units on the basis of major functions performed. All departments report to a coordinating head, e.g. in a manufacturing concern the key functions will include production, purchasing, marketing, personnel, etc. This structure tries to achieve high level of specialisation by grouping similar jobs together.

           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Ans.
           </strong>
           I would suggest the functional organisational structure as all these major functions could be performed well under separate departments.
           <br/>
           It offers following advantages
           <br/>
           (i) A functional structure leads to occupational specialisation since emphasis is placed on specific functions.
           <br/>
           (ii) It promotes control and coordination within the department.
           <br/>
           (iii) It helps in increasing managerial and operational efficiency.
           <br/>
           (iv) It leads to minimal duplication of effort. Hence, it is economical.

            Functional structure
           </strong>
           Under functional structure, an organisation is divided into different departments or units on the basis of major functions performed. All departments report to a coordinating head, e.g. in a manufacturing concern the key functions will include production, purchasing, marketing, personnel, etc. This structure tries to achieve high level of specialisation by grouping similar jobs together.
           <br/>
           ” Disadvantages of functional structure are:
           <br/>
           (i) Specialists working in different departments may not be able to see the perspective of the organisation as a whole, e.g. the production department may get involved in producing a quality product without regard to the fact it might not sell at a high price. As a result, it becomes difficult to achieve the objectives of the organisation.
           <br/>
           (ii) It becomes difficult to hold a particular department responsible for any problem, e.g. when sales are declining, who is responsible? It is difficult to determine whether the marketing department or the production department is responsible for not producing a quality product.
           <br/>
           (iii) Functional heads do not obtain experience required for top management positions. Specialised skills and narrow perspective may lead to inflexibility.
           <br/>
           (iv) Conflict often arises when the interests of two or more departments are not compatible.

           Advantages of functional structure are as follows:
           <br/>
           (i) A functional structure provides occupational specialisation, since, emphasis is placed on specific functions.
           <br/>
           (ii) It promotes control and coordination within a department because of similarity in the task being performed.
           <br/>
           (iii) It increases managerial and operational efficiency and this results in higher profit.
           <br/>
           (iv) It makes training of employees easier as it focuses on a limited range of skills.
           <br/>
           (v)  It ensures the performance of all activities necessary for achieving organisational objectives. Due attention can also be given to different functions.

<strong>
            Ans.

<strong>
            Divisional structure
           </strong>
           Under the divisional structure, an organisation is divided into different divisions or units on the basis of products or geographical area. Each division is a self contained, semi-autonomous business unit. Each unit has a divisional manager responsible for performance and who has authority over the unit. There are certain matters, which are determined at the apex level only, viz goal determination and policy formation.
           <br/>
           It is suitable for those enterprises where:
           <br/>
           (i) A large variety of products are manufactured.
           <br/>
           (ii) An organisation grows and needs more employees, more departments.
           <br/>
           Advantages of divisional structure are as follows:
           <br/>
           (i) Product specialisation helps in the development of varied skills.
           <br/>
           (ii) It helps in the fixation of responsibility as divisional heads are accountable for profits, revenues and costs related to their departments.                                                                                                                                                  «
           <br/>
           (iii) It promotes flexibility and initiative because each division functions as an autonomous unit which leads to faster decision-making.
           <br/>
           (iv) It facilitates expansion and growth as a new division can be added without interrupting the existing -operations.

<strong>
            Divisional structure

           <br/>
           Advantages of divisional structure are as follows:
           <br/>
           (i) Product specialisation helps in the development of varied skills.

           <br/>
           Limitations of divisional structure are as follows :
           <br/>
<strong>
            (i) Expensive
           </strong>
           Such a structure involves heavy financial costs due to the duplication of supporting functional units for the divisions. It also requires adequate number of capable managers to take charge of their respective divisions.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (ii) May ignore organisational interests
           </strong>
           All the divisions work as autonomous units. Divisional heads may gain power and ignores organisational interests.
