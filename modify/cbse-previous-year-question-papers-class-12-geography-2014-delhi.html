           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Components of population change in the world are :
           <br/>
           (i) Higher birth rate
           <br/>
           (ii) Lower death rate

           (iii) Migration.
          </p>
<p>
           Impact:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            In developing countries like India the levels of maternal and infant mortality are very high. Repeated childbirths are seen as an insurance against multiple infant and child deaths. Vast numbers of people cannot avail of the services provided by government sponsored family planning programmes even when they are available, due to problems of knowledge and its access.
           </li>
<li>
            As the population grows, the pressure on natural resources will increase.
           </li>
<li>
            Population pressure will reduce the per capita availability of land for farming, which will affect availability of food grain, drinking water etc.
           </li>
<li>
            Pressure on basic amenities also increases due to change in population.

           </li>
<li>
            It is practiced on permanent ranches.
           </li>
<li>
            Parcels are fenced to regulate the grazing.
           </li>
<li>
            The number of animals in a pasture is kept according to the carrying capacity of the pasture.
           </li>

           Question 23.
           <br/>
           Differentiate between Bilateral trade and Multilateral trade. Explain how ports are helpful in trade. [2 + 3 = 5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Bilateral Trade : It is the exchange of goods between two countries. Bilateral trade agreements give preference to certain countries in commercial relationships, facilitating trade and investment between the home country and the foreign country by reducing or eliminating tariffs, import quotas, export restraints and other trade barriers. Bilateral trade agreements can also help minimize trade deficits.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Multilateral Trade : A trading system that facilitates the exchange of financial instruments between multiple countries. Multilateral trading allows eligible contract participants to gather and transfer a variety of securities, especially instruments that may not have an official market. These facilities are often electronic systems controlled by approved market operators or larger investment banks. Traders will usually submit orders electronically, where a matching software engine is used to pair buyers with sellers.
          </p>
<p>
           Ports are backbone of world trade, and play a key role in inward and outward movement of goods, and countries, which built good ports with excellent infrastructure became competitive manufacturing centers/hubs. Good quality port infrastructure is essential for the growth of trade and competitiveness of the manufacturing sector. For example, port sector plays an important role in the growth of Indian economy. Ninety percent of trade by volume and seventy percent of trade by value is carried out by maritime transportation, which involves handling through port. Trade or manufacturing based economy cannot grow without sufficient high quality port infrastructure.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           On the basis of forms of shapes, the five patterns of rural settlements in the world are :
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Linear Pattern – In such settlements, houses are located along a road, railway fine, river or a canal edge.
           </li>
<li>
            Rectangular Pattern — In such pattern, roads cut each other at right angle. These patterns can be seen in plain areas.
           </li>
<li>
            Circular Pattern – Such patterns develop around lakes, tanks or likewise places.
           </li>
<li>
            Star like Pattern — In the pattern, several roads converge star shaped settlements developed by houses built along the roads.
           </li>
<li>
            T-shaped Pattern – Such pattern develops at tri-junction of roads.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Question 25.
           <br/>
           “The decades 1921-51 are referred to as the period of steady growth of population whereas the decades 1951-1981 are referred to as the period of population explosion in India.” Explain giving reasons. [21/2 + 21/2 = 5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           1921-51 are considered to be period of steady growth because :
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            During this period the population increased from 251 million to 361 million.
           </li>
<li>
            The mortality rate started to decline due to improvement in general health and sanitation conditions.
           </li>
<li>
            The crude birth rate remained high the combined effect of these factors was that the population started increasing steadily.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           1951-81 Period of Population Explosion :
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            After 1951, there was a steady pace in the mortality rate.
           </li>
<li>
            The fertility rate remained high.
           </li>
<li>
            This unprecedented growth rate was due to the improvement in wealth facilities, living condition. Death rate declined much faster than the birth rates. This resulted in high natural increase. Thus their period is called the period of population explosion.
           </li>
</ol>

           <br/>
           What is the role of ‘World Trade Organization’ as an International Organization ? Why has the World Trade Organization been criticized by some countries ? Explain. [2 + 3 = 5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The World Trade Organization (WTO) is the only global international organization dealing with the rules of trade between nations. At its heart are the WTO agreements, negotiated and signed by the bulk of the world’s trading nations and ratified in their parliaments. The goal is to help producers of goods and services, exporters, and importers to conduct their business. Role of WTO are :
           <br/>
           (i) Trade Negotiation : The WTO regulates agreements over goods, services and intellectual property. They spell out the principles of liberalization, and the permitted exceptions. They include individual countries’ commitments to lower customs tariff and other trade barriers, and to keep open services markets.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Implementation and Monitoring : All WTO members must undergo periodic scrutiny of their trade policies and practices, each review containing reports by the country concerned and the WTO Secretariat.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Dispute Settlement : The WTO’s procedure for resolving trade quarrels under the Dispute Settlement understanding is vital for enforcing the rules and therefore for ensuring that trade flows smoothly.
          </p>
<p>
           Various countries claim that the issues of labour and environment are stead fastly ignored. The absence of proper environmental regulation and resource management, increased trade might cause so much adverse damage that the gains from trade would be less than the environmental costs. The “Green room” discussion in the WTO as unrepresentative and non-inclusive; more active participants, representing more diverse interests and objectives, have complicated WTO decision-making.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 25.
           <br/>
           Define the term ‘migration’. Explain the social and environmental consequences of migration in India. [1 + 2 + 2 = 5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Migration is the movement by people from one place to another with the intention of settling in the new location. The movement is typically over long distances and from one country to another, but internal migration is also possible. Migration may be by individuals, family units or large groups.
          </p>
<p>
           In India internal migration often involves longer working hours, poor living and working conditions, social isolation and poor access to basic amenities. Most migrant labourers in India are employed in the unorganised sector, where the lack of regulation compounds their vulnerability; they are largely ignored by government and NGO programmes. The social effects of migration vary widely. Sending areas may experience both gains and losses in the short-term but may stand to gain over the longer- term. For receiving areas temporary worker programs help to address skill shortages but may decrease domestic wages and add to public welfare burden. The social effects of migration for both sending and receiving areas may also vary depending on who is moving. Most migrants and refugees do not have the financial means to travel long distance. They seek a safe heaven in another region in their own or in a neighbouring country. The economically weakest countries are therefore most severely affected by migration and refugee problems.
          </p>
<p>
           Migration also has a demonstrable impact, both positive and negative, impact on the environment and territory in both the countries of origin and destination. Both phenomena are in reversible, proportional correlation and figure more apparently just before during the shortly after upon the undesirable environmental changes, depending on their expansion and cross-border territorial involvement in human and material sources.

           Question 18.
           <br/>
           Explain with examples, how the industries are responsible for polluting water resources in India. [3 × 1 = 3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The dumping of industrial waste into rivers leads to water pollution. Industries generate ordinary domestic sewage that can be treated by municipal facilities but those industries that generate waste water with high concentrations of conventional pollutants (eg., oil and grease), toxic pollutants (eg., heavy metals, volatile organic compounds) or other non-conventional pollutants such as ammonia are highly responsible for polluting the water resources. When these enter the water resources from industries deteriorate the quality of water and render it unfit for human use. This in turn, limits the availability of usable water resources. Most industries in India do not follow the norms and let the waste water go into the rivers without the process of detoxification. For example—The Yamuna River is the most polluted river in the country between Delhi and Etawah. This is just because industries between these two cities do not detoxify their waste water. Other severely polluted river is the Sabarmati river at Ahmedabad.

           Question 21.
           <br/>
           Give the meaning of ‘human development’. Explain the four pillars of human development. [1 + 4 = 5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Human development is defined as the process of enlarging people’s freedoms and opportunities and improving their well-being. Human development is about the real freedom ordinary people have to decide who to be, what to do, and how to live.
          </p>
<p>
           Human development shares a common vision with human rights. The goal is human freedom. Therefore, human development is interconnected with human rights and human freedom because in well-managed prisons life expectancy and literacy as measured by the Human Development Index could be quite high and in pursuing capabilities and realizing rights, this freedom is vital. People must be free to exercise their choices and to participate in decision-making that affects their lives. The four pillars of human development are as follows :
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Equity: Equity is the idea of fairness for every person, between men and women; we each have the right to an education and health care.
           </li>
<li>
            Sustainability : Sustainability is the view that we all have the right to earn a living that can sustain our lives and have access to a more even distribution of goods.
           </li>
<li>
            Productivity : Productivity states the full participation of people in the process of income generation.
           </li>
<li>
            Empowerment: Empowerment is the freedom of the people to influence development and decision that affect their lives.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Question 25.
           <br/>
           Explain why Kerala has a higher level of human development than other States of India. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Freedom from hunger, poverty, servitude, bondage, ignorance, illiteracy and any other form of domination is the key to human development.
          </p>
<p>
           Kerala with the composite index value of 0.638 is placed at the top rank on Human Development Index (India)-2001.
          </p>
<p>
           There are several socio-political, economic and historical reasons for such a state of affairs. Kerala is able to record the highest value in the HDI largely due to its impressive performance in achieving almost hundred percent literacy (90.92 per cent) in 2001. Apart from the educational attainment, the levels of economic development too has significant impacts on HDI. Efforts to institutionalize the balanced development with its main focus on social distributive justice, has been made by the State.
          </p>
<p>
           Kerala has made significant achievements in most of the fields of Human Development like free from illness and ailment and living a reasonably long life span and indicative of a healthy life. Availability of pre and post natal health care facilities in order to reduce infant mortality and post-delivery deaths among mothers, old age healthcare, adequate nutrition and safety of individual are some important measures of a healthy and reasonably long life. Kerala has done reasonably well in these areas.
