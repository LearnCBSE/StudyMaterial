             Answer:
            </strong>
</span>
           (i) “STABILITY” is what the entrepreneur is looking for in the beginning as stability strategy is less risky, easier and comfortable, unconsciously pursued, defensive and satisfactory and also enhances functional efficiencies.
           <br/>
           A firm is said to follow stability/consolidation strategy if:
           <br/>
           (a) It decides to serve the same markets with the same products.
           <br/>
           (b) It continues to pursue the same objectives.
           <br/>
           (c) It concentrates its resources in a narrow product-market sphere for developing a meaningful competitive advantage.
           <br/>
           (ii) An expansion strategy is a strategy that a firm pursues when—
           <br/>
           (1) Additional Product: It serves the public in additional product or service or adds markets of functions to its definitions.
           <br/>
           (2) Growth: The growth is fast in the market in which their products are sold.
           <br/>
           (3) More profit margin: They tend to have larger than average profit margins.
           <br/>
           (4) Stretch: A stretch rather than a fit strategy is pursued.
           <br/>
           (5) New users etc: New markets, new products, new processes and new usage for old products are regularly developed.
           <br/>
           (6) Expansion: Internal expansions, mergers and acquisitions are used to achieve expansion.
           <br/>
           (7) Globalisation: Shifting from local to global markets is an expansion sign.
           <br/>
           (iii) Diversification means adding new lines of business. These new lines of business may be related to the current business or may be quite unrelated. If the new lines added, make use of the firm’s existing technology, production facilities or distribution channels or it amounts to backward or forward integration, it may regarded as related diversification. For example, Wipro which is in the business of edible oils and soaps, has also diversified its business segments in information technology, etc.

             Answer:
            </strong>
</span>
<strong>
            (i) It is desirous for a firm to grow and expand because of the following reasons:
           </strong>
<br/>
           (a)
           <strong>
            Natural desire:

           (b)
           <strong>
            Survival:
           </strong>
           Growth is essential for survival because if a firm does not grow when competitor firms are growing, then it might lose its competitiveness.
           <br/>
           (c)

           <br/>
           (d)
           <strong>
            Market leader:
           </strong>
           Market leadership is an objective of growth for several companies and they want to dominate the other firms.
           <br/>
           (e)

            Avoidance of risks:
           </strong>
           A company needs to diversify its business to minimize risks. By it profit earned by one product can be used for compensating for the losses of other product.
           <br/>
           (f)
           <strong>
            Full utilization:
           </strong>
           Growth becomes essential for full utilization of the existing
           <br/>
           resources of the company. Profit can only be maximized in the presence of full utilization of resources.
           <br/>
           (g)

           </strong>
           People working in the organisation will be motivated only if there are challenges, opportunities and growth in the enterprise. More job satisfaction is obtained in this way.
           <br/>

           </strong>
<br/>
           (a) Penetration Strategies
           <br/>
           (b) Market Development Strategy
           <br/>
           (c) Product Development Strategies.
           <br/>
           A profit market expansion can assume following forms:
           <br/>
           Penetration Strategies: This is a strategy to grow by encouraging existing customers to buy more of the firm’s existing product. Here, the enterprise tries and attempts to increase the sale of the current products in the current markets by following approaches:
           <br/>
           (a) Encourage frequency of use of the product.
           <br/>
           (b) Attract new clientele using sales promotion techniques like Advertising, Personal selling, Discounts, Coupons, etc.
           <br/>

           <br/>
           (ii) Two firms are available to an entrepreneur to go in for integrative expansion, they are Vertical Expansion and Horizontal Integration.
           <br/>
           (a) Vertical expansion refers to any of the activities or functions, previously performed by the firm right from sourcing of raw material to supply of finished goods, through external agencies will now be performed by the firm itself. It is done through:
           <br/>
           1. Backward Integration: It is a step back on the value-added chain towards the raw materials, by which the producer also becomes a raw materials wholesaler. For example: For manufacturing of ‘Nirma’ detergent an important raw material used ‘Linear Alkaline Benzyne’ (LAB) which was earlier purchased is now manufactured by Nirma itself.
           <br/>
           2. Forward Integration: It refers to taking a step forward on the value added chain towards the customers by which the firm also becomes a finished goods wholesaler.
           <br/>
           (b) Horizontal integration occurs at the same level of the value added chain but . involves a complementary, value added chain. It may involve acquisition of one
           <br/>
           or more competitors at the same level of business.
           <br/>
           For example: Hindustan Lever Ltd. has ensured for itself a presence in all segments using new brand launches and by strategic moves such as the acquisition of TOMCO.
           <br/>
           The acquisition of TOMCO enhanced HLL’s market share like it bought Hamam, 501, Moti, Jai and OK into HLL’s brands, with already having Lifebuoy, Liril, Lux, Rexona, Dove, LeSancy as its powerful line extensions.
           <br/>
           (iii) Market development strategies refers to selling the firm’s existing products to new groups of customers, i.e. exploring new markets for the existing product at national as well as at international level.
           <br/>
           (a) New Demographic Market: By studying demographic characteristics like Income, Marital status, Standard of living, Education, Age and sex of the customers enterprise can offer the same product to a different demographic group.
           <br/>
           For example: Tata Nano caters to a segment of middle income group.
           <br/>
           (b) New Product use: Entrepreneur can find out that people use its product in a way that was not expected. This new knowledge of product use provides insight into how the product may be valuable to a new group of buyers. For example: Aspirin, a pain killer, has been found good for heart too.
           <br/>
           (c) New Geographical Market: This means selling the existing products in the new locations and new markets. This has the potential of increasing sales of the product by offering the product to customers who have not previously had the chance to purchase its products. This is based on Customers’ preferences, Language, Legal requirements, etc.

           Raymond’s, in early eighties, launched some ready to wear trousers called ‘Double Barrels’. The product received a low response. Aggressive advertising, naming the same now as Raymond’s Leg wear with caption “no hassles with tailors” and the promise of a “great fit” too failed. The company, realized through research that by and large Indians were attracted to a foreign label consequently, the company decided to market their readymade garments under a new brand name — PARK AVENUE which conveyed a ‘Western’ image to fit in for perfect stylish and a completely Western image from top to bottom. Park Avenue extended wallets, belts and kerchiefs under one roof. With ease company sailed through the critical stages.
