           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Define the term ‘mobility’ of charge carriers in a conductor, write its S.I. unit. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           Mobility of charge carriers in a conductor is defined as the magnitude of their drift velocity per unit applied electric field.
           <br/>
           Mobility, μ = Drift of electric field
           <br/>
           \(\mu=\frac{v_{d}}{\mathrm{E}}\)
           <br/>
           S.I. unit of mobility is m

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           The carrier wave is given by C(t) = 2 sin (8πt) volt.

           Question 3.
           <br/>
           For any charge configuration, equipotential surface through a point is normal to the electric field. Justify. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           If the electric field were not normal ‘ to equipotential surface, it would have non zero component along the surface. To move a charge against this component, work would have to be done. But no work is needed to move a test charge on an equipotential surface. Hence electric field must be normal to the equipotential Surface at every point.

           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Two spherical bobs, one metallic and the other of glass, of the same size are allowed to fall freely from the same height above the ground. Which of the two would reach earlier and why ? [1]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           Glass bob will reach the ground earlier than the metallic bob. As the metallic bob falls, it intercepts earth’s magnetic field and induced currents are set up in it which oppose its downward motion. But no such currents are induced in the glass bob.

           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Show variation of resistivity of copper as a function of temperature in a graph. [1]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           The variation of resistivity of copper with temperature is parabolic in nature. This is shown in the following graph :

           Question 6.
           <br/>
           A convex lens is placed in contact with a plane mirror. A point object at a distance of 20 cm on the axis of this combination has its image coinciding with it self. What is the focal length of the lens ? [2]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           The figure shows a convex lens L placed in contact with a plane mirror M. P is the point object, kept in front of
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 Physics 2014 Delhi 3" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-127344" height="113" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Physics-2014-Delhi-3.png" width="164"/>
<br/>
           this combination at a distance of 20 cm, from it. As the image coincides with itself, the rays from the object, after refraction from lens, should fall normally on the mirror M, so that they retrace their path. For this, the rays from P, after refraction from the lens must form a parallel beam perpendicular to M. For clarity, M has been shown at a small distance from L (in diagram). As the rays from P, form a parallel beam after refraction, P must be at the focus of the lens. Hence, the focal length of the lens is 20 cm.

           Question 7.
           <br/>
           Write the expression, in a vector form, for the Lorentz magnetic force \(\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}\) due to a charge moving with velocity \(\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}\) in a magnetic field \(\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}\). What is the direction of the magnetic force ? [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Lorentz magnetic force is given by the following relation:
           <br/>
           \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{F}}=\mathrm{q}(\vec{v} \times \overrightarrow{\mathrm{B}})\)
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           Here q, is the magnitude of the moving charge. The direction of the magnetic force is perpendicular to the plane containing the
           <br/>
           velocity vector\(\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}\) and the magnetic field vector \(\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}\).
          </p>

           Question 8.
           <br/>
           The figure given below shows the block diagram of a generalized communication system. Identify the element labelled ‘X’ and write its function. [2]
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 Physics 2014 Delhi 4" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-127345" height="144" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 394px) 100vw, 394px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Physics-2014-Delhi-4.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Physics-2014-Delhi-4.png 394w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Physics-2014-Delhi-4-300x110.png 300w" width="394"/>
<br/>
           Question 9.
           <br/>
           Out of the two magnetic materials, ‘A’ has relative permeability slightly greater than unity while ‘B’ has less than unity. Identify the nature of the materials ‘A’ and ‘B’. Will their susceptibilities be positive or negative ? [2]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           For a para magnetic material, the relative permeability lies between 1 &lt; µr &lt; 1 + ∈ and its susceptibility lies between 0 &lt; x &lt; ∈.
          </p>
<p>
           Hence, ‘A’ is a para magnetic material and its susceptibility is positive. This is because its relative permeability is slightly greater than unity. For a diamagnetic material, the relative permeability lies between 0 ≤ µ
           <sub>
            r
           </sub>
           &lt; 1 and its susceptibility lies between -1 &lt; x &lt; 0. Hence, ‘B’ is a diamagnetic material and its susceptibility is negative. This is because its relative permeability is less than unity. Here µ
           <sub>
            r
           </sub>
           and x refer to the relative permeability and susceptibility.

           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Given a uniform electric field \(\overset { \rightarrow }{ E } =5\times { 10 }^{ 3 }\overset { \wedge }{ i } N/c\) find the flux of this field through a square of 10 cm on a side whose plane is parallel to the YZ plane. What would be the flux through the same square if the plane makes a 30° angle with the X-axis ? [2]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           When the plane is parallel to the Y-Z plane:

<br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           (i) As the dielectric slab is introduced between the plates of the capacitor, its capacitance will increase. Hence, the potential drop across the capacitor will decrease (V= Q/C). As a result, the potential drop across the bulb will increase (since both are connected in series). So, its brightness will increase.
           <br/>
           (ii) As the resistance (R) is increased, the potential drop across the resistor will increase. As a result, the potential drop across the bulb will decrease (since both are connected in series). So, its brightness will decrease.

           Question 15.
           <br/>
           State the underlying principle of a cyclotron. Write briefly how this machine is used to accelerate charged particles to high energies. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The underlying principle of a cyclotron is that an oscillating electric field can be used to accelerate a charged particle to high energy.
          </p>
<p>
           A cyclotron involves the use of an electric field to accelerate charge particles across the gap between the two D-shaped magnetic field regions. The magnetic field is perpendicular to the paths of the charged particles that makes them follow in circular paths within the two D
           <sub>
            s
           </sub>
           . An alternating voltage accelerates the charged particles each time they cross the D
           <sub>
            s
           </sub>
           . The radius of each particle’s path increases with its speed. So, the accelerated particles spiral toward the outer wall of the cyclotron.

           The particle gets accelerated again and again, and its velocity increases. Therefore, it attains high kinetic energy. The positively charged ion adopts a circular path with a constant speed v, under the action of magnetic field B, which is perpendicular to the planes of D’s of radius r.

           <br/>
           (a) greater value of de-Broglie wavelength associated with it, and

           (b) less momentum ?
           <br/>
           Give reasons to justify your Answer. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) de-Broglie wavelength, λ ∝ 1 /mass (for same accelerating potential) Mass of a proton is less as compared to a deuteron. So, proton will have greater value of de-Broglie wavelength associated with it.
           <br/>
           (b) Momentum, p ∝ mass (for same accelerating potential) Mass of deuteron is more as compared to a proton. So, it will have a greater value of momentum.

           Question 23.
           <br/>
           (a) A mobile phone lies along the principal axis of a concave mirror. Show, with the help of a suitable diagram, the formation of its image. Explain why magnification is not uniform.
           <br/>
           (b) Suppose the lower half of the concave mirror’s reflecting surface is covered with an opaque material. What effect this will have on the image of the object ? Explain. [4]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           (a) The image of the mobile phone formed by the convave mirror will be as shown in fig. given below :
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 Physics 2014 Delhi 24" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-127365" height="229" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Physics-2014-Delhi-24.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Physics-2014-Delhi-24.png 374w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Physics-2014-Delhi-24-300x184.png 300w" width="374"/>
<br/>
           Since the object distance for the different parts of the mobile phone along its length are different, the different parts will be magnified differently. Hence, the magnification is not uniform.
           <br/>
           (b) As the laws of reflection are true for all points of the mirror, the height of the whole image will be produced. However, as the area of the reflecting surface has been reduced, the image intensity will be reduced. In other words, the image produced will be less bright.

<br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Ampere’s circuital law states that the circulation of the resultant magnetic field along a closed, plane curve is equal to µ
           <sub>
            0
           </sub>
           times the total current crossing the area bounded by the closed curve, provided the electric field inside the loop remains constant.
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 Physics 2014 Delhi 31" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-127372" height="179" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Physics-2014-Delhi-31.png" width="254"/>
<br/>
           In the above illustration, the Ampere’s circuital law can be written as follows :
           <br/>
           \(\begin{array}{c}{\oint \overrightarrow{\mathrm{B}} \cdot \overrightarrow{d l}=\mu_{0} i} \\ {\text { where } i=i_{1}-i_{2}}\end{array}\)
          </p>
<p>
           (b) (i) The magnetic field due to a current carrying solenoid:
           <br/>
           \(B=\mu_{0} n i\)
          </p>
<p>
           where, n = number of turns per unit length,
           <br/>
           i = current through the solenoid.
          </p>
<p>
           Now, the magnetic field due to solenoid S
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           will be in the upward direction and the magnetic field due to S
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           will be in the downward direction (by right-hand screw rule).
           <br/>
           \(\begin{aligned} \mathrm{B}_{\text {net}} &amp;=\mathrm{B}_{1}-\mathrm{B}_{2} \\ \mathrm{B}_{\text {net}} &amp;=\mu_{0} n_{1} \mathrm{I}-\mu_{0} n_{2} \mathrm{I} \\ &amp;=\mu_{0} \mathrm{I}\left(n_{1}-n_{2}\right) \end{aligned}\)
           <br/>
           (ii) The magnetic field is zero outside a solenoid.

           Question 26.
           <br/>
           Answer the following: [5]
           <br/>
           (a) Name the e.m. waves which are suitable for radar systems used in aircraft navigation. Write the range of frequency of these waves.
           <br/>
           (b) If the earth did not have atmosphere, would its average surface temperature be higher or lower than what it is now ? Explain.
           <br/>
           (c) An e.m. wave exerts pressure on the surface on which it is incident. Justify.
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           (a) Microwaves are suitable for radar systems used in aircraft’s navigation. The range of frequency for these waves is 10

           </sup>
           Hz.
           <br/>
           (b) In the absence of atmosphere, there would be no greenhouse effect on the surface of the Earth. As a result, the temperature of the Earth would decrease rapidly, making it difficult for human survival.
           <br/>
           (c) The momentum transported by electromagnetic waves is given by
           <br/>
           \(p=\frac{\mathrm{U}}{c}\)
          </p>
<p>
           where U is the energy transported by electromagnetic waves in a given time and c is speed of electromagnetic waves in free space. As a result, when these waves strike a surface, pressure and hence force is exerted by them on the surface.

           and N the number of atoms after time t. After time t, let dN be the number of atoms which disintegrate in a short interval dt,
          </p>
<p>
           then rate of disintegration will be, dN/dt, this is also called the activity of the element.

           According to Rutherford-Soddy law,
           <br/>
           \(\begin{array}{l}{\frac{d \mathbf{N}}{d t} \propto \mathbf{N}} \\ {\frac{d \mathbf{N}}{d t}=-\lambda \mathbf{N}}\end{array}\) ……… (i)

           The neutron-proton ratio is also an important factor that determines the stability of a nucleus. A proton-rich nucleus undergoes positron emission (β+ decay), so as to improve the neutron- proton ratio. The positron emission decreases proton number relative to neutron number and the product nucleus becomes relatively more stable. In β+ decay, neutrino (v) is emitted so as to conserve spin.
           <br/>
           ii) The nucleus so formed is an isobar of \(11N\overset { 22 }{ a } \) because the mass number is same, but the atomic numbers are different.

           Answer :
           <br/>
           (a) (i) The condition for the sustained interference is that both the sources must be coherent (i.e., they must have the same wavelength and the same frequency, and they must have the same phase or constant phase difference).
          </p>
<p>
           Two sources are monochromatic if they have the same frequency and wavelength. Since they are independent, i.e., they have different phases with irregular difference, they are not coherent sources.

           The phenomenon of restricting the vibration of light (electric vector) in a particular direction perpendicular to the direction of the wave propagation is called polarization of light.
          </p>
<p>
           When unpolarised light is passed through a Polaroid, only those vibrations of light pass through the crystal, which are parallel to the axis of the crystal (AB). All other vibrations are absorbed and that is why intensity of the emerging light is reduced.
          </p>
<p>
           The plane ABCD in which the vibrations of the polarized light are confined is called the plane of vibration. The plane KLMN that is perpendicular to the plane of vibration is defined as the plane of polarization.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) When unpolarised light is incident on the glass-air interference at Brewster angle Z’B, then reflected light is totally polarised. This is called Brewster’s Law.
          </p>
<p>
           When light is incident at Brewster angle, the reflected component OB and the refracted component OC are mutually perpendicular to each Other.

           <br/>
           (a) Lenz’s law : According to Lenz’s law, the polarity of the induced emf is such that it opposes a change in magnetic flux responsible for its production.

<br/>
           When the north pole of a bar magnet is pushed towards the coil, the amount of magnetic flux linked with the coil increase. Current is reduced in the coil from a direction such that it opposes the increase in magnetic flux. This is possible only when the current induced in the coil is in anti-clockwise direction, with respect to an observer. The magnetic moment M associated with this induced emf has north polarity, towards the north pole of the approaching bar magnet.
          </p>
<p>
           Similarly, when the north pole of the bar magnet is moved away from the coil, the magnetic flux linked with the coil decreases. To counter this decrease in magnetic flux, current is induced in the coil in clockwise direction so that its south pole faces the receding north pole of the bar magnet. This would result in an attractive force which opposes the motion of the magnet and the corresponding decrease in magnetic flux

           It works on the process of electromagnetic induction, i.e., when a coil rotates continuously in a magnetic field, the effective area of the coil, linked (normally) with the magnetic field lines, changes continuously with time. This variation of magnetic flux with time results in the production of a (alternating) emf in the coil.

           (a) Differentiate between three segments of a transistor on the basis of their size and level of doping.
           <br/>
           (b) How is a transistor biased to be in active state ?
           <br/>
           (c) With the help of necessary circuit diagram, describe briefly how n-p-n transistor in CE configuration amplifies a small sinusoidal input voltage. Write the expression for the ac current gain.
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           (a) As we know that n-type semi-conductor has more concentration of electrons than that of a hole and p-type semi-conductor has more concentration of holes than an electron. Due to the difference in concentration of charge carriers in the two regions of p-n junction, the holes diffuse from p-side to //-side and electrons diffuse from n-side to p-side.
          </p>
<p>
           When an electron diffuses from n to p, it leaves behind an ionized donor on n-side. The ionized donor (+ve charge) is immobile as it is bounded by the surrounding atoms. Therefore, a layer of positive charge is developed on the n-side of the junction. Similarly, a layer of negative charge is developed on the p-side.
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 Physics 2014 Delhi 43" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-127384" height="163" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 395px) 100vw, 395px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Physics-2014-Delhi-43.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Physics-2014-Delhi-43.png 395w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CBSE-Previous-Year-Question-Papers-Class-12-Physics-2014-Delhi-43-300x124.png 300w" width="395"/>
<br/>
           Hence, a space-charge region is formed on both side of the junction, which has immobile ions and is devoid of any charge carrier, called as depletion layer or depletion region.
           <br/>
           (b)

<br/>
           From the V-I characteristics of a junction diode, it is clear that it allows the current to pass only when it is forward biased. So when an alternating voltage is applied across the diode, current flows only during that part of the cycle when it is forward biased.

<br/>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           A proton and an alpha particle are accelerated through the same potential ? Which one of the two has
           <br/>
           (i) greater value of de-Broglie wavelength associated with it and
           <br/>
           (ii) less kinetic energy. Give reasons to justify your answer. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer :
           <br/>
           (i) de-Broglie wavelength of a particle depends upon its mass and charge for same accelerating potential such that
           <br/>
           \(\lambda \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{(\text { Mass })(\text { Charge })}}\)
          </p>
<p>
           If mass and charge of a proton are m
           <sub>
            p
           </sub>
           and e respectively, then, mass and charge of an alpha particle are 4m
           <sub>
            p
           </sub>
           and 2e respectively. Where, e is the charge of an electron
           <br/>
           \(\begin{aligned} \frac{\lambda_{p}}{\lambda_{\alpha}} &amp;=\sqrt{\frac{m_{\alpha} q_{\alpha}}{m_{p} q_{p}}} \\ &amp;=\sqrt{\frac{\left(4 m_{p}\right)(2 e)}{\left(m_{p}\right)(e)}}=2 \sqrt{2} \end{aligned}\)
          </p>
<p>
           Thus, de-Broglie wavelength associated with proton is 2√2 times of the de-Broglie wavelength of alpha particle.
           <br/>
           (ii) K.E. ∝ q (for same accelerating potential).
           <br/>
           Charge of an alpha particle is more as compared to a proton. So, it will have a greater value of K.E. Hence, proton will have lesser kinetic energy.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Given a uniform electric field \(\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}=2 \times 10^{3} \hat{i} \mathrm{N} / \mathrm{C}\) Find the flux of this field through a square of side 20 cm, whose plane is parallel to the Y-Z plane. What would be the flux through the same square, if the plane makes an angle of 30° with the X-axis ? [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
