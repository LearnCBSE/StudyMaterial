<h2>
           CBSE Class 6 English Grammar Reported Speech
          </h2>
<p>
           1. There are two different ways in which we can report the words of a speaker :
           <br/>
           (a) Direct Speech or Direct Narration.
           <br/>
           (b) Indirect Speech or Indirect Narration.
          </p>
<p>
           2. (a) Direct Speech contains the actual words of the speaker ; as—
           <br/>
           Sarla said, “My father has a roaring business in Mumbai”
           <br/>
           He said to me, “I am feeling unwell today.”
           <br/>
           In these sentences, actual words of the speaker are given within inverted commas without any change.
           <br/>
           (b) Indirect Speech gives the substance of the speaker’s actual words and not the exact words spoken by him or her ; as—
           <br/>
           Sarla said that her father had a roaring business in Mumbai He told me that he was feeling unwell that day.
          </p>
<p>
           3. The actual words of the speaker, given within ‘ inverted commas’ are called the Reported Speech. In the same way, the Verb which introduces the Reported Speech is called the Reporting Verb.
           <br/>
           In the sentence above ‘said’ is the Reporting Verb and ‘My father has a roaring business in Mumbai’ is the Reported Speech.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           Reporting Verb and Reported Speech. Look at the following sentences :
           <br/>
           Radha says, “I shall’ finish my home-work today.”
           <br/>
           Sushma said to Pushpa, “Show me your dolls.”
          </p>
<p>
           The verbs ‘says and said’ in the above sentences are ‘Reporting Verbs’.
           <br/>
           The exact words of the speaker given within the inverted commas are ‘Reported Speech’.
          </p>
<p>
           4. Here are some distinctive points regarding the Direct Speech and Indirect Speech :
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
<strong>
            In the Direct Speech
           </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
            The Reported Speech is put within Reported (Inverted) Commas.
           </li>
<li>
            The Reported Speech and the Reporting Verb are separated by a Comma.
           </li>
<li>
            The first word of the Reported Speech begins with a capital letter.
           </li>
</ul>
