           Question 11.
           <br/>
           Read the source given below and answer the questions that follow:
           <br/>
           In recent years, the central and state governments in India are taking special steps to attract foreign companies to invest in India. Industrial zones, called Special Economic Zones (SEZs), are being set up. SEZs are to have world class facilities: electricity, water, roads, transport, storage, recreational and educational facilities. Companies who set up production units in the SEZs do not have to pay taxes for an initial period of five years. Government has also allowed flexibility in the labour laws to attract foreign investment. You have seen that the companies in the organised sector have to obey certain rules that aim to protect the workers’ rights. In recent years, the government has allowed companies to ignore many of these. Instead of hiring workers on a regular basis, companies hire workers “flexibly’ for short periods when there is intense pressure at work. This is done to reduce the cost of labour for the company. However, still not satisfied, foreign companies are demanding more flexibility in labour laws.
           <br/>
           (A) Companies in the organised sector have to obey certain rules that aim to protect the workers’ rights. Name two such rules. (2)
           <br/>
           (B) Do you think the kind of industrial development based on loose labour laws is sustainable? (1)
           <br/>
           (C) Give one word to replace the bold phrase. (1)
          </p>
<p>
           Question 12.
           <br/>
           Read the given source and answer the questions that follow:
           <br/>
           As the movement spread, foreign cloth was boycotted, and liquor shops were picketed. Peasants refused to pay revenue and chaukidari taxes, village officials resigned, and in many places forest people violated forest laws – going into Reserved Forests to collect wood and graze cattle. Worried by the developments, the colonial government began arresting the Congress leaders one by one. This led to violent clashes in many places. When Abdul Ghaffar Khan, a devout disciple of Mahatma Gandhi, was arrested in April 1930, angry crowds demonstrated in the streets of Peshawar, facing armoured cars and police firing. Many were killed. A month later, when Mahatma Gandhi himself was arrested, industrial workers in Sholapur attacked police posts, municipal buildings, law courts and railway stations – ail structures that symbolised British rule. A frightened government responded with a policy of brutal repression. Peaceful satyagrahis were attacked, women and children were beaten, and about 100,000 people were arrested.
           <br/>
           (A) Mention a few programmes which were undertaken in the Civil Disobedience movement. (1)
           <br/>
           (B) Why was the civil disobedience movement relaunched? (2)
           <br/>
           (C) How did people react to the arrest of Mahatma Gandhi? (1)
