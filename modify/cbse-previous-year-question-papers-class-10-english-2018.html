           (READING) 20
          </p>
<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below: [8]
           <br/>
           (1) Tourists to Jammu and Kashmir have another attraction — a floating post office on the Dal Lake in Srinagar, the first in the country. ‘Floating Post Office, Dal Lake’s— claimed to be the only one such post office in the world is built on an intricately carved maroon houseboat, fastened on the western edge of the Dal Lake.
           <br/>
           (2) This post office lets you avail of all the regular postal services available in the country while being afloat. The seal used on everything posted from Floating Post Office is unique — along with the date and address, it bears the design of a boatman rowing a shikara on the Dal Lake. The special feature of this post office is that letters posted from here carry a special design which has the picturesque scenery of Dal Lake and Srinagar city. These pictures reach wherever these letters are posted to and hence promote Kashmir as a tourist destination across the world.
           <br/>
           (3) This is actually a heritage post office that has existed since British times. It was called Nehru Park Post Office before 2011. But then the chief postmaster John Samuel renamed it as ‘Floating Post Office’
           <br/>
           (4) The post office’s houseboat has two small rooms—one serves as the office and the other a small museum that traces the philatelic history of the state postal department. It has a shop that sells postage stamps and other products.
           <br/>
           (5) But for the locals, Floating Post Office is more than an object of fascination. ? 1-2 crore is deposited per month in the Floating Post Office by communities living in and around the Dal Lake. The
           <br/>
           lake has several islets that are home to more than 50,000 people.
           <br/>
           (6) The greatest fear is the recurrence of 2014 like floods in which the houseboat had gone for a toss uncontrollably pushed by the flood. Rescue teams had to anchor it using special mechanism in a nearby highland. Then it was brought back on the Dal after the water receded. The biggest boon is that at no time of the year do you need a fan in this post-office.

           Question 2.
           <br/>

           4. Nonetheless, for the young the use of mobile phone can be like an addiction and they can misuse it. Young people are also prone to getting involved in undesirable activities on the Internet. This might have adverse effect on their academic performance. Therefore, young people should always be monitored and made aware of its bad outcomes.
           <br/>
           5. Also a major contributor to its popularity is the availability of prepaid or pay as you go services form a phone shop or an online store. This allows subscribers to load text or airtime credits to their handsets by the use of their credit cards, debit cards or by buying a prepaid card from the network they subscribe to. This plan also doesn’t commit a particular customer to a contract. If prepaid card is not that appealing to you, then you can opt to subscribe using the pay by month plan.

           Sub : Nuisance caused by loudspeakers in the city
           <br/>
           Respected Sir,
           <br/>
           I am writing this letter to express my anguish and annoyance over the problem of loud speakers during the examination days. I am a student studying in 10th grade of a reputed school in the city. The final examinations are just around the comer.
          </p>
<p>
           During the day, the loud noise from speakers disturbs and distracts as much as it does at night. Especially on the weekends, the noise from the loudspeakers is unbearable. Lask weekend, I could not study at all. In spite of the law prohibiting loud music playing beyond 10 O’Clock, people violate the rules and regulations by playing it all night. There are thousands of students like me who have to suffer from this problem. Besides, there are some old patients and new bom babies in every locality who get affected by this noise pollution. I, on behalf of all the students of the city plead and appeal to concerned authorities to look into the matter as this is a clear contravention of the laws.
           <br/>
           Yours truly,
           <br/>

           ILL EFFECTS OF TOO MUCH TELEVISION
           <br/>
           By Rahul/Pratibha, Class X Most children nowadays, watch television as part of their leisure time. Two of the major reasons are that there is a great variety of television programs and the ease of availability. If children do not get to watch their programs on television, they will use their parents’ phone to watch the *, programs online. Researchers have found that watching television for young children has both its own share of advantages and disadvantages. Watching TV for children is an enjoyable activity but it can have several ill effects on their cognitive abilities, health, and their habits. Children who watch a lot of TV programs can suffer from the lack of concentration.
          </p>
<p>
           When he or she watches a TV program, they get only a few minutes to concentrate and that too in between the advertisements. They also find it difficult to imagine because when they watch a television program, they only need to look and listen. A child who likes to watch television programs can be in front of it for many hours. Obesity is a fast-growing problem amongst children these days due to the lack of physical activity. Children become lazy to try out new activities as they do not want to miss their television programs. They ofter prefer watching T.V. over doing their homework or learning their lessons, which eventually leads to a drop in the academic performance. Another bad effect is that they will be influenced by violence in some television programs as they have not yet developed their critical thinking skill to differentiate between good and bad. Anything in excess is harmful to a person. Thus, watching excessive television can lead to poor physical and mental health.

           <br/>
           Tortoise and hare — good friends — tortoise — known for his slow speed — hare has fast speed — makes fun of tortoise — challenges him — referee selected — race starts — hare overconfident — takes a nap — tortoise wins.

           <br/>
           There was a joint family of six members including grandparents. It was the 75th birthday of the grandmother and the family

           THE HARE AND THE TORTOISE
           <br/>
           In a forest, there lived two very good friends, a hare and a tortoise. The hare was famous for his speed while the tortoise was famous for doing things slowly. One day, the hare was making fun of the tortoise for being so slow. “Do you ever reach anywhere on time?” he asked with a mocking laugh. “Yes,” replied the tortoise, “and, I will get there sooner than you think ‘I’ll run a race with you.
          </p>
<p>
           The hare was much amused at the idea of running a race with the tortoise, so he agreed. The Fox, who had consented to act as a refere, marked the distance and started the runners off. The hare was soon far out of sight. He got over confident so he thought how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a hare, then he lay down beside the course to take a nap until the tortoise would catch up.
          </p>

<p>
           The tortoise meanwhile kept going slowly and steadily, and after a time, he passed through the place where the hare was sleeping. The hare slept on very peacefully; and when at last he woke up, the tortoise was near the goal. The hare now ran his swiftest, and fastest but he could not overtake the tortoise in time.

           There was a joint family of six members, including grandparents. It was the 75th birthday of the grandmother and the family planned to celebrate it. They decided to make her feel special, and so they thought of celebrating the day by planning a surprise party for her. They invited all their relatives and all of grandma’s friends at home. The children of the house were told to take grandma out so that she couldn’t come to know about the surprise and also so the relatives could come home without grandma’s keen notice of things.
          </p>
<p>
           The children happily took grandma to the garden nearby. They talked to their grandmother about her childhood memories and about her likes and dislikes. They kept their beloved grandmother engaged till it got dark. When they reached home, the grandmother found the home in complete silence and darkness. She got worried and * called out to her son. The lights were suddenly turned on with all the relatives wishing her. She did not expect such a wonderful birthday surprise. She had tears in her eyes. She was overwhelmed seeing her loved ones around. It was a moment of joy for her.

           In life, people who easily trust others are sometimes made to look foolish. One should not be too trusting. Describe how Oliver Lutkins made a fool of the young lawyer.

           What lesson on death and suffering did the Buddha teach Gotami in the chapter, ‘The Sermon at Banaras’
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Lutkins impressed the young lawyer with his friendly manner, thus leading the lawyer to think that the people of the town „ were trustworthy. He claimed to know most of the places where Lutkins could be found. Lutkins charged the young lawyer a high price for the hack and food. He alerted Fritz, his friends and mother not to reveal his identity to the lawyer. He even went to the railway station to see the young lawyer off.
          </p>
<p>
           The young lawyer on his second visit leamt that the hack driver himself was Lutkins. The young lawyer thus learned a lesson that no one should be too trustworthy and one must be alert at all times.
           <br/>
           OR
           <br/>
           In his sermon at Banaras, Buddha taught Gotami that the life of mortals is brief, troubled and combined with pain. Death is common for all, it cannot be avoided. He compared human life to ripe fruits that eventually decay or as earthen vessels that will break someday. Neither a father nor his kinsmen can save anyone. Weeping or grieving cannot bring back the dead to life nor bring peace of mind but only cause pain and suffering to the grieving body. One should accept death without lamentation, complaint and overcome sorrow and grief thus, bringing peace of mind, which is a blessing.
