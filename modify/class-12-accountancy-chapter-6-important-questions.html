           Give the meaning of forfeiture of shares. (All India 2014 (C), 2010; Foreign 2015)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Forfeiture of shares means cancellation of shares and seizure of the amount received from the defaulting shareholders, whose shares have been forfeited. Upon forfeiture, the name of original shareholder must be removed from the register of members. Forfeiture results in reduction of share capital.

           Answer:

           (ii) Forfeited shares can re-issued at any rate of discount. The only condition is that the amount of discount allowed on the re-issue of forfeited shares must not exceed the amount forfeited on such shares. In this case, shares can be re-issued at a minimum price of ₹ 45 per share (i.e. 100 – 55).

<br/>
           1. Calculation of Amount not Received on First and Final Call
           <br/>
           Shares allotted to Kumar = \(\frac { 80,000 }{ 90,000 }\) x 1,800 = 1,600 shares 90,000
           <br/>
           Amount received on 1,800 shares @ ₹ 10 each = ₹ 18,000
           <br/>
           Amount transferred to share capital account (1,600 x 5) = ₹ 8,000
           <br/>
           Amount transferred to securities premium account (1,600 x 5) = ₹ 8,000
           <br/>
           Excess money received on application = ₹ 2,000

           Working Notes:
           <br/>
           Those who applied for 1,00,000 shares were allotted = 75,000 shares
           <br/>
           Ravi who applied for 1,500 shares was allotted = 75,000 x \(\frac { 1500 }{ 100000 }\) = 1,125 shares
           <br/>
           Share Application and Allotment received on 1,500 shares of ₹ 9 each
           <br/>
           (including premium of 7 5 each) = 13,500
           <br/>
           Shares allotted (1,125 x 9) = (10425)
           <br/>
           Excess application and allotment money received = 3,375
           <br/>
           Share first and final call due to 1,125 shares of ₹ 6 each = 6,750
           <br/>
           Share first and final call not received = 3,375 (6,750 – 3,375)
           <br/>
           Therefore, share first and final call received = 2,21,625 (2,25,000 – 3,375)
