          </p>
<p>
           Question 2(i).
           <br/>
           What are the basic elements of weather?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The weather elements include temperature, pressure, wind, humidity and cloudiness.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 2(ii).
           <br/>
           What is a weather chart?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The data received from various weather observatories are in plenty and detailed. Therefore, they cannot be incorporated in one single chart unless the coding designed to give the economy of expression is used. These are called synoptic weather charts and the codes used are called meteorological symbols.

           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The highest category is Class-I. Typical instrumental facility available in a Class-I observatory consists of the following:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Maximum and minimum thermometers
           </li>
<li>
            Anemometer and wind vane
           </li>
<li>
            Dry and Wet bulb thermometer
           </li>
<li>
            Rain gauge
           </li>
<li>
            Barometer
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Observations are taken in these observatories normally at 00,03,06,09, 12,15,18,21 hours (Greenwich Mean Time) around the globe. However, for logistic reasons, some of the observatories take limited number of daily observations upper air observation during daytime only.
          </p>

           3. Answer the following question in not more than 125 words.
           <br/>
           Discuss how weather maps and charts are prepared and how they are useful to us.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Weather Maps: A weather map is the representation of weather phenomena of the earth or a part of it on a flat surface. It depicts conditions associated with different weather elements such as temperature, rainfall, sunshine and cloudiness, direction and velocity of winds, etc. on a particular day. These observations being taken at fixed hours are transmitted by code to the forecasting stations. The central office keeps a record of the observations, which forms
           <br/>
           the basis for making a weather map. The upper air observations which are procured from hill stations, aeroplanes, pilot balloons, etc. are plotted separately.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           Indian Meteorological Department is getting the weather maps and charts prepared regularly. Meteorological observatories transmit the data to the Central Observatory at Pune twice a day. Data is also collected on ships plying on the Indian seas. A good progress has been made in the field of weather forecasting and observation with the establishment of weather observatories in Antarctica, the International Indian Ocean Expedition, and the launching of rockets and weather satellites.
          </p>
<p>
           Utility:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Weather maps help us to predict weather.
           </li>
<li>
            Weather forecasting helps farmers, fishermen, soldiers, navigators and pilots in many ways.
           </li>
<li>
            Disaster management is not possible without weather maps and charts. Weather Charts: The data received from various weather observatories are in plenty and detailed. As such, they cannot be incorporated in one single chart unless the coding designed to give the economy of expression is used. These are called synoptic weather charts and the codes used are called meteorological symbols.
           </li>
<li>
            Utility:
            <ul>
<li>
              Weather charts provide the primary tools for weather forecasting.
             </li>
<li>
              They help in locating and identifying different air masses, pressure systems, fronts and areas of precipitation.
             </li>
</ul>

<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           How is weather forecasting useful for different groups?
           <br/>
           Answer:

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Explain in short about Wind Vane.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Purpose: Wind vane is a device used to measure the direction of the wind. Structure: The wind vane is a light-weight revolving plate with an arrowhead on one end and two metal plates attached to the other end at the same angle. This revolving plate is mounted on a rod in such a manner that it is free to rotate on a horizontal plane. It responds even to a slight blow of wind.
           <br/>
           Important Aspect: The arrow always points towards the direction from which the wind blows.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Explain in short about Anemometer.
           <br/>
           Answer: An anemometer is an instrument that measures wind speed and wind pressure. Anemometers are important tools for meteorologists, who study weather patterns. They are also important to the work of physicists, who study the way air moves. The most common type of anemometer has three or four cups attached to horizontal arms. The arms are attached to a vertical rod. As the wind blows, the cups rotate, making the rod spin. The stronger the wind blows, the faster the rod spins. The anemometer counts the number of rotations, or turns, which is used to calculate wind speed. Because wind speeds are not consistentâ€”there are gusts and lulls-wind speed is usually averaged over a short period of time.
          </p>
<p>
           A similar type of anemometer counts the revolutions made by windmill-style blades. The rod of windmill anemometers rotates horizontally. Other anemometers calculate wind speed in different ways. A hot-wire anemometer takes advantage of the fact that air cools a heated object when it flows over it.

           Question 4.
           <br/>
           How do Weather observatories work in India?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Each day weather maps are prepared for that day by the Meteorological Department from the data obtained from observations made at various weather stations across the world. In India, weather-related information is collected and published under the auspices of the Indian Meteorological Department, New Delhi, which is also responsible for weather forecasting.
          </p>
<p>
           The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) was established in 1875, with its headquarters at Calcutta. The IMD headquarters are presently located at New Delhi.

           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Write a short note on Stevenson Screen.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Stevenson screen is designed to protect thermometers from precipitation and direct sunlight while allowing air to circulate freely around them. Formation: It is made from wood with louvered sides to allow free and even flow of air. It is painted white to reflect radiation. It stands on four legs and is about 3 feet 6 inches above the level of the ground. The legs must be sufficiently rigid and be buried sufficiently in the ground to prevent shaking.
          </p>
<p>
           The front panel is hinged at the bottom to form a door, which allows for maintenance and reading of the thermometers. The door of Stevenson screen is always towards the north in the northern hemisphere and towards the south in the southern hemisphere because direct sunrays also affect mercury.
          </p>
<p>
           Objective: The purpose of the Stevenson screen is to create a uniform temperature enclosure that closely represents the same temperature as the air outside.

           Question 6.
           <br/>
           What is aneroid barometer? How does it work?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Aneroid barometer gets its name from the Greek word, aneros in which â€˜aâ€™ means â€˜notâ€™, â€˜nerosâ€™ means â€˜moistureâ€™, hence aneroid means without liquid. It is a compact and portable instrument. It consists of a corrugated metal box made up of a thin alloy, sealed completely and made airtight after partial exhaustion of air.
          </p>
<p>
           It has a thin flexible lid, which is sensitive to changes of pressure. As the pressure increases, the lid is pressed inward, and this, in turn, moves a system of levers connected to a pointer, which moves clockwise over the graduated dial and gives higher reading. When the pressure decreases, the lid is pushed outward and the pointer moves counter clockwise, indicating lower pressure. Barograph works on the principle of aneroid barometer.
          </p>
<p>
           There are a number of vacuum boxes placed one above the other so that the displacement is large. A system of levers magnifies this movement which is recorded by a pen on a paper attached to a rotating drum. The readings of a barograph are not always accurate, and therefore, they are standardised by comparing them with a mercury barometer reading.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 7.
           <br/>
           Explain about surface observatory in detail.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A typical surface observatory has instruments for measuring and recording weather elements like temperature (maximum and minimum), air pressure,humidity, clouds, wind and rainfall. Information: Specialised observatories record elements like radiation, ozone atmospheric trace gases, pollution and atmospheric electricity. These observations are taken all over the globe at fixed times of the day as decided by the WMO and the use of instruments are made conforming to international standards, thus making observations globally compatible.
          </p>
<p>
           Different types of surface observatories in India: In India, meteorological observations are normally classified into five categories depending upon their instruments and the number of daily observations taken. The highest category is Class-I. Typical instrumental facility available in a Class-I observatory consists of the following: Maximum and minimum thermometers, Anemometer, and wind vane, Dry and Wet bulb thermometer, Rain gauge and Barometer.

           Class 11 Practical Work in Geography Chapter 8 Long Answer Type Questions
          </h4>
<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           How is information about weather and related facts collected organized and dispensed in India?
           <br/>
           Answer: In India, weather-related information is collected and published under the auspices of the Indian Meteorological Department, New Delhi, which is also responsible for weather forecasting.
          </p>
<p>
           A typical surface observatory has instruments for measuring and recording weather elements like temperature (maximum and minimum), air pressure, humidity, clouds, wind and rainfall. Specialised observatories also record elements like radiation, ozone atmospheric trace gases, pollution and atmospheric electricity. These observations are taken all over the globe at fixed times of the day as decided by the WMO and the use of instruments are made conforming to international standards, thus making observations globally compatible. In India, meteorological observations are normally classified into five categories depending upon their instruments and the number of daily observations taken. The highest category is Class-I.
          </p>
<p>
           Typical instrumental facility available in a Class-I observatory consists of the following:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Maximum and minimum thermometers
           </li>
<li>
            Anemometer and wind vane
           </li>
<li>
            Dry and Wet bulb thermometer
           </li>
<li>
            Rain gauge
           </li>
<li>
            Barometer
           </li>
</ul>
<p>
           Observations are taken in these observatories normally at 00,03,06,09, 12,15,18,21 hours (Greenwich Mean Time) around the globe. However, for logistic reasons, some of the observatories take limited number of daily observations upper air observation during daytime only.
          </p>
<p>
           Weather satellites make comprehensive and large-scale observations of different meteorological elements at the ground level as well in the upper layers of the atmosphere. The geo-stationary satellites provide space-based observations about weather conditions. The Indian National Satellite (INSAT) provides valuable observations of temperature, cloud cover, wind and associated weather phenomena.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Explain the working of a barometer.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The instrument used to measure atmospheric pressure is called a barometer. The unit of measurement is in the millibar. The most commonly used barometers are the mercury barometer, aneroid barometer and barographs. All the three work differently. Their working is explained below briefly:
          </p>
<p>
           1. Mercury barometer: It is an accurate instrument and is used as a standard. In it the atmospheric pressure of any place is balanced against the weight of a column of mercury in an inverted glass tube.
          </p>
<p>
           2.Aneroid barometer: It is a compact and portable instrument. It consists of a corrugated metal box made up of a thin alloy, sealed completely and made airtight after partial exhaustion of air. It has a thin flexible lid, which is sensitive to changes of pressure. As the pressure increases, the lid is pressed inward, and this, in turn, moves a system of levers connected to a pointer, which moves clockwise over the graduated dial and gives higher reading. When the pressure decreases, the lid is pushed outward and the pointer moves counter clockwise, indicating lower pressure.
          </p>
<p>
           3. Barograph: It works on the principle of aneroid barometer. There are a number of vacuum boxes placed one above the other so that the displacement is large. A system of levers magnifies this movement which is recorded by a pen on a paper attached to a rotating drum. The readings of a barograph are not
           <br/>
           always accurate, and therefore, they are standardised by comparing them with a mercury barometer reading.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           Write short notes on the following:
           <br/>
           (i) Safe place for a thermometer
           <br/>
           (ii) Indian Daily Weather report
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Safe place for thermometer: It is not safe to keep a thermometer in sunlight. We should also not keep it in airtight surroundings. The Stevenson screen is designed to protect thermometers from precipitation and direct sunlight while allowing air to circulate freely around them. It is made from wood with louvered sides to allow free and even flow of air. It is painted white to reflect radiation. The purpose of the Stevenson screen is to create a uniform temperature enclosure that closely represents the same temperature as the air outside.
          </p>
<p>
           It stands on four legs and is about 3 feet 6 inches above the level of the ground. The legs must be sufficiently rigid and be buried sufficiently in the ground to prevent shaking. The front panel is hinged at the bottom to form a door, which allows for maintenance and reading of the thermometers. The door of Stevenson screen is always towards the north in the northern hemisphere and towards the south in the southern hemisphere because direct sunrays also affect mercury.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Indian Daily Weather Report: IMD became a member of the World Meteorological Organization after independence on 27 April 1949. The agency has gained in prominence due to the significance of the monsoon rains on Indian agriculture. It plays a vital role in preparing the annual monsoon forecast, as well as in tracking the progress of the monsoon across India every season.
          </p>
<p>
           IMD undertakes observations, communications, forecasting and weather services. In collaboration with the Indian Space Research Organisation, the IMD also uses the IRS series and the Indian National Satellite System (INSAT) for weather monitoring of the Indian subcontinent. IMD was the first weather bureau of a developing country to develop and maintain its own satellite system. IMD is one of the 6 worldwide Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers of the Tropical Cyclone Programme of the World Weather Watch of the World Meteorological Organization. It is regional nodal agency for forecasting, naming and disseminating warnings about tropical cyclone in the Indian Ocean north of the Equator.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           Explain the history of weather forecasting in India.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In 1686, Edmond Halley published his treatise on the Indian summer monsoon, which he attributed to a seasonal reversal of winds due to the differential heating of the Asian land mass and the Indian Ocean. The first meteorological observatories were established in India by the British East India Company. These included the Calcutta Observatory in 1785, the Madras Observatory in 1796 and the Colaba Observatory in 1826. Several other observatories were established in India during the first half of the 19th century by various provincial governments.
          </p>
<p>
           After a tropical cyclone hit Calcutta in 1864, and the subsequent famines in 1866 and 1871 due to the failure of the monsoons, it was decided to organise the collection and analysis of meteorological observations under one roof.
           <br/>
           As a result, the Indian Meteorology Department was established in 1875. Henry Francis Blanford was appointed the first Meteorological Reporter of the IMD. In May 1889,Sir John Eliot was appointed the first Director General of Observatories in the erstwhile capital, Calcutta. The IMD headquarters were later shifted to Shimla in 1905, then to Pune in 1928 and finally to New Delhi in 1944.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           Explain the instruments used to measure atmospheric pressure.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A barometer is a scientific instrument used in meteorology to measure atmospheric pressure. A simple barometer consists of a long glass tube (closed at one end, open at the other) filled with mercury and turned upside down into a container of mercury. The barometer works by balancing the mercury in the glass tube against the outside air pressure, just like a set of scales. As air pressure increasesâ€”that is, as the air becomes heavierâ€”it pushes more of the mercury up into the tube. As air pressure decreases, more of the mercury drains from the tube. So the level of mercury in the tube provides a precise measure of air pressure.
          </p>
<p>
           Mercury barometer is . an accurate instrument and is used as a standard. In it the atmospheric pressure of any place is balanced against the weight of a column of mercury in an inverted glass tube. Aneroid barometer is a compact and portable instrument. It consists of a corrugated metal box made up of a thin alloy, sealed completely and made airtight after partial exhaustion of air. It has a thin flexible lid, which is sensitive to changes of pressure. As the pressure increases, the lid is pressed inward, and this, in turn, moves a system of levers connected to a pointer, which moves clockwise over the graduated dial and gives higher reading.
          </p>
<p>
           When the pressure decreases, the lid is pushed outward and the pointer moves counterclockwise, indicating lower pressure. Barograph works on the principle of aneroid barometer. There are a number of vacuum boxes placed one above the other so that the displacement is large. A system of levers magnifies this movement which is recorded by a pen on a paper attached to a rotating drum. The readings of a barograph are not always accurate, and therefore, they are standardised by comparing them with a mercury barometer reading.

           The wind vane is a lightweight revolving plate with an arrowhead on one end and two metal plates attached to the other end at the same angle. This revolving plate is mounted on a rod in such a manner that it is free to rotate on a horizontal plane. It responds even to a slight blow of wind. The arrow always points towards the direction from which the wind blows.
          </p>
<p>
           The amount of rainfall is measured with the help of a rain gauge. The rain gauge consists of a metal cylinder on which a circular funnel is fitted. The diameter of the funnelâ€™s rim is normally 20 cm. The rain drops are collected and measured in a measuring glass. Normally, rainfall is measured in the units of millimetres or centimetres. Snow is also measured in a similar manner by turning it into liquid form.
          </p>
<p>
           Thermometer is used to measure air temperature. Most thermometers are in the form of a narrow closed glass tube with an expanded bulb at one end. The bulb and the lower part of the tube are filled with liquid such as mercury or alcohol. Before the other end is sealed off, the air in the tube is released by heating it. The bulb of the thermometer in contact with the air gets heated or cooled, as the case may be, as a result of which the mercury in the bulb rises or falls. A scale is marked on the glass tube and readings are taken from there.
          </p>
<p>
           The two most common scales used in thermometers are Centigrade and the Fahrenheit. On the Centigrade thermometer, the temperature of melting ice is marked 0Â°C and that of boiling water as 100Â°C, and the interval between the two is divided into 100 equal parts. On the Fahrenheit thermometer, the freezing and boiling points of water are graduated as 32Â°F and 212Â°F respectively.

           While the maximum thermometer and minimum thermometer are used to measure the air temperature, the dry bulb and the wet bulb thermometers are used to determine the humidity in the air. A set of these thermometers is kept in the Stevenson Screen.
          </p>
<p>
           The maximum thermometer is designed to record the highest temperature during a day. As the temperature increases, the mercury moves up into the tube; however, as the mercury cools, it cannot move downwards because of a constriction in the tube. It must be reset again to bring it down. The minimum thermometer records the lowest reading in a day. In this thermometer, alcohol is used in place of mercury. When the temperature decreases, the metal pin in the tube goes down and strikes at the minimum temperature.
          </p>
<p>
           The air around us has weight, and it exerts great pressure on the earthâ€™s surface. At the sea level, under normal conditions, the pressure of air is 1.03 kg per square centimetre. Due to constant movement of air, change in temperature and variation in its vapour content, the weight of the air changes continuously with time and place. The instrument used to measure atmospheric pressure is called a barometer.
          </p>
<p>
           The most commonly used barometers are the mercury barometer, aneroid barometer and barographs. The unit of measurement is in the millibar.
           <br/>
           Globally, meteorological observations are recorded at three levels, viz. surface observatories, upper air observatories and space-based observation platforms. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a specialised agency of the United Nations, coordinates these observations.
          </p>
<p>
           A typical surface observatory has iiistruments for measuring and recording weather elements like temperature (maximum and minimum), air pressure, humidity, clouds, wind and rainfall. Specialised observatories also record elements like radiation, ozone atmospheric trace gases, pollution and atmospheric electricity. These observations are taken all over the globe at fixed times of the day as decided by the WMO and the use of instruments are made conforming to international standards, thus making observations globally compatible.
