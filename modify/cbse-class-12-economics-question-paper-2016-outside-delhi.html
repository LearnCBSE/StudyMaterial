<li>
            Government expenditure (G), including government consumption and investment &lt; expenditure.
           </li>
<li>
            Net Exports (X â€“ M), i.e., Exports â€“ Imports Or, Excess demand refers to the situation when aggregate demand is in excess of aggregate supply, i.e., (AD &gt; AS) corresponding to full employment in the economy.
           </li>

           Question 13.
           <br/>
           An economy is in equilibrium. Calculate Marginal Propensity to Consume: [4]
           <br/>
           National income = 1,000
           <br/>
           Autonomous consumption expenditure = 200
           <br/>
           Investment expenditure = 100
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Given: Y = 1,000, \(\overline{\mathrm{C}}\) = 200, I = 100, MPC = ?
           <br/>
           Consumption function equation, C = \(\overline{\mathrm{C}}\) + (MPC)Y â€¦â€¦. (i)
           <br/>
           C = 200 + (MPC)1,000
           <br/>
           At equilibrium level, Y = C + I
           <br/>
           â‡’ 1,000 = 200 + (MPC) 1,000 + 100 â€¦â€¦[From (i)
           <br/>
           â‡’ 1,000 â€“ 200 â€“ 100 = (MPC) 1,000 â‡’ 700 = (MPC) 1,000
           <br/>
           âˆ´ MPC = \(\frac{700}{1000}\) = 0.7

           Question 14.
           <br/>
           Sale of petrol and diesel cars is rising particularly in big cities. Analyse its impact on gross domestic product and welfare. [4]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Final sale of cars raises GDP, because final sales are final products. Cars provide convenience in transportation and add to the welfare of people. At the same time, rise in sale of petrol and diesel cars particularly in big cities will lead to air pollution and noise pollution which will adversely affect the health of citizens (including children). This is a negative externality occurring because of the smoke and harmful gases being emitted by the vehicles. This leads to respiratory problems and other health issues which will impact the GDP of the nation adversely and reduce the welfare of the people.

           Question 15.
           <br/>
           Explain the â€˜medium of exchangeâ€™ function of money. How has it solved the related problem created by barter? [4]
           <br/>
           Or
           <br/>
           Explain the â€˜standard of deferred paymentâ€™ function of money. How has it solved the related problem created by barter?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Money acts as a medium of exchange for the sale and purchase of goods and services. In the absence of money under the barter system, goods were exchanged for goods. This required double coincidence of wants. Introduction of money has separated the acts of sale and purchase. It allows freedom of choice as every person can buy goods of his choice and also from people offering him the best bargain.
          </p>
<p>
           Or
          </p>
<p>
           Deferred payments refer to those payments which are to be made at some time in the future. In a modem economy, a large number of transactions involve future payments which can easily be stated in terms of money. This is possible because value of money remains more or less constant and it possesses the quality of general acceptability.
          </p>
<p>
           In the barter system, it was difficult to make such future payments in terms of goods and services. There was always the risk of the commodity to be repaid increasing or decreasing in value. There could also be a disagreement regarding the quality of goods or services to be repaid. This function of money has facilitated borrowing and lending activities and promoted trading. It has also led to the creation of financial institutions.

           Redistribution of income and wealth. Through its tax and expenditure policy, the government attempts to reduce inequalities of income. The government influences the personal disposable income of households by making transfer payments and collecting taxes. In this way, it influences the income distribution in the society.
          </p>
<p>
           Inequalities of income and wealth can also be reduced through progressive income taxation in which higher the income, higher is the tax rate. Government can impose higher taxes on incomes of the rich and on the luxury goods and services consumed by them. The money so collected can be spent on welfare projects for the poor such as providing free healthcare, free education, subsidies, minimum wages, etc. These expenditures by the government will raise the disposable income of the poor.

           Allocation of Resources. Government budget is a reflection of certain goals the government wants to achieve. There are many economic activities which are not undertaken by the private sector either due to lack of profits or due to huge investment expenditure involved. Government can undertake these activities on its own. There are many other activities like water supply, sanitation etc. which are necessarily undertaken by the government in public interest. In addition, government can encourage the private sector through tax concessions, subsidies etc. to undertake certain production in public interest. By doing so, government helps in influencing allocation of resources.

           Question 17
           <br/>
           Given saving curve, derive consumption curve and state the steps in doing so. Use diagram. [6]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Consumption and Saving curves are complementary curves. This means that if one of the functions is known then the other can be easily obtained. Consumption function refers to the functional relationship between consumption and national income.
           <br/>
           As shown in the diagram, a straight line Saving curve is plotted showing saving function at different levels of income.

<li>
            First we draw a 45Â° income line from the origin.
           </li>
<li>
            At zero level of income, autonomous consumption expenditure will be shown equal to OC (same as dissaving equal to OS). This is the starting point C of the Consumption curve.
           </li>
<li>
            At income level OR saving is zero implying that consumption expenditure must be equal to income. Therefore, by drawing a perpendicular from point R which intersects the 45Â° line, we obtain point B.
           </li>
<li>
            By joining points C and B and extending it further, we derive the Consumption curve.

           How can accelerating the growth rate of GDP solve the problem of unemployment? [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Unemployment problem can be solved through the process of accelerated growth as employment generation is considered to be a natural consequence of economic growth. To achieve higher growth rate, the development of agricultural sector is very important. Improved techniques of production, expansion of irrigation facilities, increase in public investment in agriculture would result in higher productivity of land and labour. Higher productivity results in higher production and higher growth rate leading to more employment opportunities. Growth rate can also be achieved by promoting the small scale sector through cheap and adequate availability of finance, facilities for marketing of products, technical training, etc.

<br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Sectoral Distribution of Output and Employment:
          </p>
<p>
           (i) Agriculture Sector. In China, with 17.5 per cent of its workforce engaged in agriculture, its contribution to GDP was 9 percent. Indiaâ€™s contribution of agriculture to GDP was only 17 percent despite the majority of its population being engaged in the agricultural sector.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Industry and Service Sectors. In both India and China, the industry and service sectors have less proportion of workforce but contribute more in terms of output. In China, manufacturing contributes the highest to GDP at 43 percent whereas in India it is the service sector which contributes the highest. Thus, Chinaâ€™s growth is mainly contributed by the Manufacturing sector and Indiaâ€™s growth by the Service sector.

           Question 31.
           <br/>
           Discuss the key issues of rural development in India. [4]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Following are the key issues associated with rural development in India:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            The quality of human resource to be improved.
           </li>
<li>
            The process of rural development should also involve the development of infrastructure like electricity, irrigation, rural credit, roads etc.
           </li>
<li>
            Introduction and implementation of land reforms should form an important part of the process of rural development.
           </li>
<li>
            Productive resources of localities should be developed so as to increase employment opportunities.
           </li>
<li>
            Majority of the rural population still lives in poverty which is why alleviation of poverty should be an important aspect of rural development.
           </li>

           Question 32.
           <br/>
           (a) What is the Great leap forward campaign of China? [2]
           <br/>
           (b) What is the significance of the one child norm adopted by China in 1979. [2]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) This campaign initiated by China in 1958 aimed at industrialisation on a massive scale.
           <br/>
           Under this campaign, the citizens were encouraged to set up industries even in their backyards. This campaign provided equal opportunity to everyone to participate in the growth process which ultimately led to their economic development.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) The one child norm adopted by China has successfully reduced the growth rate of population. However, this also implies that after a few decades there will be proportionately more elderly people in Chinaâ€™s population as compared to young people. In other words, a limited number of young people will have to look after the welfare of a large number of elderly population. This will not only hamper their growth but also reduce the working population.

           Question 33.
           <br/>
           Read the paragraph given below and answer the questions that follow:
          </p>
<p>
           Indian poverty persists not only due to insufficient economic activity but also due to the presence of a large unorganised sector. In 2018, only 50% of the Indian population participated in the labour force, 81 % of which was employed in the informal sector, also known as the unorganised sector. Although the informal sector is accredited with the absorption of large masses of workers that would otherwise remain unemployed due to the absence of formal-sector opportunities, the reprieve provided by it is detrimental to the countryâ€™s developmental progress.
          </p>
<p>
           The informal segment of the economy is responsible for maintaining Indiaâ€™s unequal status quo. The informal sector consists of enterprises which are labour-intensive. Low- skilled labourers who are desperate enough to work for miserly wages in order to meet their subsistence requirements largely constitute the labour force of unorganised economic activities. Since unorganised firms operate outside of the jurisdiction of corporate law, workers in their employment are assured of neither job-security nor social protection. Owing to the nationâ€™s mammoth population, an oversupply of menial labour is paving the way for easy exploitation on the part of unconscionable entrepreneurs.
          </p>
<p>
           The expendable nature of the unorganised labour force causes wages to remain at minimal levels, sometimes lower than the legal, minimum. Also, the prices of products and services produced by these workers usually do not rise in sync with the rate of inflation, further adding to their despair. Workers are unable to improve their work-expertise in such a paradigm, and are deprived of career growth opportunities and finally are bereft of the capacity to accumulate significant savings. In this manner, they are further excluded from the main economy due to their inability to save and invest.
          </p>
<p>
           (i) Identify the reasons responsible for the slow growth of the workers of the unorganised sector. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The expendable nature of the unorganised labour force causes wages to remain at minimal level, sometimes lower than the legal minimum. Also, the prices of products and services produced by these workers usually do not rise in sync with the rate of inflation, further adding to their despair. Workers are unable to improve their work- expertise in such a paradigm, and are deprived of career growth opportunities and finally are bereft of the capacity to accumulate significant savings. In this manner, they are further excluded from the main economy due to their inability to save and invest.

           Question 34.
           <br/>
           (a) The period of British rule has been called as an economic drain despite a favourable balance of trade. Why? [3]
           <br/>
           (b) What were the main causes of Indiaâ€™s agricultural stagnation and backwardness during the British rule? [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) During the British rule, we had a trade balance which was in our favour. This was because India as always remained an export leader, the difference being that India now exported raw materials instead of the finished or manufactured goods it was earlier famous for. The export of these essential raw materials like clothes, food- grains, kerosene etc. created a shortage in the domestic market. Imports, which constituted mainly of finished goods such as cotton cloth, machinery etc., were also rising continuously but not in the same proportion as exports. Indiaâ€™s foreign trade resulted in an export surplus which was used for purposes which did not benefit us and therefore led to the drain of Indian wealth.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) The main causes of Indiaâ€™s agricultural stagnation and backwardness during the British rule:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Land settlement system. Under this system, profits accruing out of agriculture went to the zamindars, in the form of Lagaan, who in turn did nothing to improve the condition and productivity of the agricultural sector.
           </li>
<li>
            Commercialisation of agriculture. Production of cash crops led to a fall in production of food crops.
           </li>
<li>
            Low level of productivity. Low level of technology, lack of irrigation facilities and negligible use of fertilisers resulted in low level of productivity.
           </li>
<li>
            Adverse effects of partition. Indiaâ€™s highly irrigated and fertile land went to Pakistan. Also, the jute and cotton growing areas became the part of Pakistan, which adversely affected the cotton and jute industries.
           </li>
