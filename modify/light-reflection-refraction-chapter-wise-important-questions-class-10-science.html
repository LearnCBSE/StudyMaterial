           Question 3.
           <br/>
           State the two laws of reflection of light. (Delhi 2011)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Laws of reflection of light states that
           <br/>
           (i) The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.
           <br/>
           (ii) The incident ray, the reflected ray and the normal to the mirror at the point of incidence all lie in the same plane.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 4.
           <br/>
           When an object is kept within the focus of a concave mirror, an enlarged image is formed behind the mirror. This image is
           <br/>
           (a) real
           <br/>
           (b) inverted
           <br/>
           (c) virtual and inverted
           <br/>
           (d) virtual and erect (2020)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (d) When an object is placed between the principal focus and pole of a concave mirror, an enlarged virtual and erect image is formed behind the mirror.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 5.
           <br/>
           What is the magnification of the images formed by plane mirrors and why? (Delhi 2015)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Magnification of images formed by plane mirrors is unity because for plane mirrors, the size of the image formed is equal to that of the object.

           Question 8.
           <br/>
           An object is placed at a distance of 30 cm in front of a convex mirror of focal length 15 cm. Write four characteristics of the image formed by the mirror. (Delhi 2017)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Four characteristics of the image formed by the given convex mirror are :
           <br/>
           (i) Virtual
           <br/>
           (ii) Erect
           <br/>
           (iii) Diminished
           <br/>

          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           Question 9.
           <br/>
           An object is placed at a distance of 12 cm in front of a concave mirror of radius of curvature 30 cm. List four characteristics of the image formed by the mirror. (Delhi 2017)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Radius of curvature (R) = 30 cm, object distance is 12 cm in front of the mirror. Thus we can say that object is placed between focus and pole. Four characteristics of the image formed by die given concave mirror when object is placed between pole and focus are:
           <br/>
           (i) Virtual
           <br/>
           (ii) Erect
           <br/>
           (iii) Enlarged
           <br/>
           (iv) Image is formed behind the mirror
          </p>
<p>
           Question 10.
           <br/>
           A ray of light is incident on a convex mirror as shown. Redraw the diagram and complete the path of this ray after reflection from the mirror. Mark angle of incidence and angle of reflection on it. (Delhi 2016)

           Answer:
           <br/>
<img alt="Light Reflection and Refraction Class 10 Important Questions with Answers Science Chapter 10 Img 4" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-147002" height="167" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Light-Reflection-and-Refraction-Class-10-Important-Questions-with-Answers-Science-Chapter-10-Img-4-1.png" width="217"/>

<p>
           Question 11.
           <br/>
           Name the type of mirrors used in the design of solar furnaces. Explain how high temperature is achieved by this device. (AI 2016)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Concave mirrors are used in the designing of solar furnaces.
           <br/>
           When a solar furnace is placed at the focus of a large concave mirror, it focuses a parallel beam of light on the furnace. Therefore, a high temperature is attained at the point after some time.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 12.
           <br/>
           “The magnification produced by a spherical mirror is -3”. List four informations you obtain from this statement about the mirror/ image. (AI 2016)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Negative sign of magnification indicates that the image is real and inverted. Since the image is real and inverted, the mirror is concave and magnification of -3 indicates that the image is magnified.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 13.
           <br/>
           AB and CD, two spherical mirrors, from parts of a hollow spherical ball with its centre at O as shown in the diagram. If arc AB = \(\frac { 1 }{ 2 }\) arc CD, what is the ratio of their focal lengths? State which of the two mirrors will always form virtual image of an object placed in front of it and why? (Foreign 2016)
           <br/>
<img alt="Light Reflection and Refraction Class 10 Important Questions with Answers Science Chapter 10 Img 5" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-147003" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Light-Reflection-and-Refraction-Class-10-Important-Questions-with-Answers-Science-Chapter-10-Img-5-1.png" width="117"/>
<br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Focal length of a mirror is given by
           <br/>
           Focal length = \(\frac { Radius of curvature }{ 2 }\)
           <br/>
           Since both the mirrors have same radius of curvature, therefore focal length of the two mirrors will be same, i.e.,
           <br/>
           \(\frac { f_1 }{ f_2 }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ 1 }\)
           <br/>
           Since virtual image is always formed by convex mirror. The mirror AB will always form virtual image.

           The linear magnification produced by a spherical mirror is +3. Analyse this value and state the (i) type of mirror and (ii) position of the object with respect to the pole of the mirror. Draw a ray diagram to show the formation of image in this case. (Foreign 2016)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Positive value of the magnification indicates that image is virtual and erect.
           <br/>
           (i) Since the image is magnified, the mirror is concave.
           <br/>

           Question 26.
           <br/>
           A concave mirror is used for image formation for different positions of an object. What inferences can be drawn about the following when an object is placed at a distance of 10 cm from the pole of a concave mirror of focal length 15 cm?
           <br/>
           (a) Position of the image
           <br/>
           (b) Size of the image
           <br/>
           (c) Nature of the image
           <br/>
           Draw a labelled ray diagram to justify your inferences. (2020)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Given, f = -15 cm, u = -10 cm.
           <br/>
           Thus the object is placed between the principal focus and pole of the mirror.
           <br/>
           (a) The position of the image will be behind the mirror.
           <br/>
           (b) The size of the image will be highly enlarged.

<p>
           Question 27.
           <br/>
           A concave mirror has a focal length of 20 cm. At what distance from the mirror should a 4 cm tall object be placed so that it forms an image at a distance of 30 cm from the mirror? Also calculate the size of the image formed. (AI 2019)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Given f = -20 cm v = -30 cm u = ?
           <br/>
           Using \(\frac { 1 }{ v }\) + \(\frac { 1 }{ u }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ f }\)
           <br/>
           \(\frac { 1 }{ u }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ f }\) – \(\frac { 1 }{ v }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ -20 }\) – \(\frac { 1 }{ -30 }\) = \(\frac { -3+2 }{ 60 }\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ u = -60 cm
           <br/>
           ∴ Object placed at 60 cm from the mirror.
           <br/>
           Also magnification, m = \(\frac { h’ }{ h }\) = \(\frac { -v }{ u }\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ h’ = \(\frac { -(-30) }{ -60 }\) × 4 = -2 cm
           <br/>
           ∴ The size of the image is 2 cm.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 28.
           <br/>
           The image of a candle flame placed at a distance of 30 cm from a mirror is formed on a screen placed in front of the mirror at a distance of 60 cm from its pole. What is the nature of the mirror? Find its focal length. If the height of the flame is 2.4 cm, find the height of its image. State whether the image formed is erect or inverted. (Delhi 2017)
           <br/>
           Given:
           <br/>
           Object distance, u = – 30 cm, image size, h’ = ?
           <br/>
           Image distance, v = – 60 cm,
           <br/>
           Object size ,h = 2.4 cm,
           <br/>
           Focal length, f = ?
           <br/>
           Using mirror formula,
           <br/>
           \(\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{v}+\frac{1}{u} \quad \text { or } \quad \frac{1}{f}=\frac{-1-2}{60}=\frac{-3}{60}=-\frac{1}{20}\)
           <br/>
           or f = – 20 cm
           <br/>
           Hence, focal length is 20 cm
           <br/>
           Also, magnification, m = \(\frac { h’ }{ h }\) = \(\frac { -v }{ u }\)
           <br/>
           or, m = \(\frac { (-60)}{ (-30) }\) = -2 or \(\frac { h’ }{ h }\) = -2
           <br/>
           h’ = – 2 × 2.4 = – 4.8 cm
           <br/>
           As the image formed is real, therefore the mirror is concave.
           <br/>
           The height of the image is 4.8 cm.
           <br/>
           The image formed is enlarged and inverted.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 29.
           <br/>
           An object 4 cm in height, is placed at 15 cm in front of a concave mirror of focal length 10 cm. At what distance from the mirror should a screen be placed to obtain a sharp image of the object. Calculate the height of the image. (Delhi 2017)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Given : object distance, u = -15 cm,
           <br/>
           object height, h = 4 cm, focal length f = -10 cm;
           <br/>
           Image distance, v = ?
           <br/>
           Using mirror formula,
           <br/>
           \(\frac{1}{v}+\frac{1}{u}=\frac{1}{f} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{v}+\frac{1}{(-15)}=\frac{1}{-10} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{v}=\frac{1}{15}-\frac{1}{10}\)
           <br/>
           or \(\frac{1}{v}=\frac{10-15}{150}=\frac{-5}{150}=\frac{-1}{30}\) or v = -30
           <br/>
           In order to obtain a sharp image of the object on the screen, screen should be placed at a distance of 30 cm in front of the mirror.
           <br/>
           Also, magnification, m = \(\frac{h^{\prime}}{h}=\frac{-v}{u}\)
           <br/>
           or \(\frac{h^{\prime}}{4}=-\frac{(-30)}{(-15)}\) or h’ = \(\frac { -(30)×4 }{ (15) }\) = -2 × 4
           <br/>
           or h’ = -8 cm
           <br/>
           Thus, the height of the image is 8 cm.

           Question 31.
           <br/>
           The image of an object formed by a mirror is real, inverted and is of magnification -1. If the image is at a distance of 40 cm from the mirror, where is the object placed? Where would the image be if the object is moved 20 cm towards the mirror? State reason and also draw ray diagram for the new position of the object to justify your answer. (AI 2016)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Since the image formed by the mirror is real and inverted, therefore the mirror is concave and magnification of the mirror will be
           <br/>
           m = –\(\frac { v }{ u }\) ⇒ -1 = –\(\frac { v }{ u }\) ⇒ v = u
           <br/>
           i.e., object and image both are formed at the centre of curvature, i.e., 40 cm from the mirror.
           <br/>
           Now, if the object is moved 20 cm towards the mirror, the object will be at the focus of the mirror and therefore the image will be formed at infinity.

           <br/>
           Since the image formed is real and inverted, the mirror is concave.
           <br/>
           Magnification, m = \(\frac { -v }{ u }\) ⇒ -2 = \(\frac { -v }{ u }\) ⇒ v = 2u
           <br/>
           Now, if v = – 30 cm then u = – 15 cm
           <br/>
           As focal length of the mirror is
           <br/>
           f = \(\frac{u v}{u+v}=\frac{-15 \times-30}{-15-30}=f=\frac{450}{-45}\) = -10 cm
           <br/>
           If the object is shifted 10 cm towards the mirror, then the object is between principal focus and the optical centre and the image formed will be virtual and erect.

           Question 34.
           <br/>
           To construct a ray diagram we use two rays of light which are so chosen that it is easy to determine their directions after reflection from the mirror. Choose these two rays and state the path of these rays after reflection from a concave mirror. Use these two rays to find the nature and position of the image of an object placed at a distance of 15 cm from a concave mirror of focal length 10 cm. (Delhi 2015, AI 2012)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           We use two rays of light, one passing through the centre of curvature of a concave mirror, and another is parallel to the principal axis. After reflection, the ray passing through the centre of a concave mirror is reflected back along the same path and the ray parallel to the principal axis will pass through the principal focus.
           <br/>
           u = -15 cm, f= -10 cm

           Using mirror formula,
           <br/>
<img alt="Light Reflection and Refraction Class 10 Important Questions with Answers Science Chapter 10 Img 25" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-147023" height="151" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Light-Reflection-and-Refraction-Class-10-Important-Questions-with-Answers-Science-Chapter-10-Img-25.png" width="260"/>
<br/>
           Using magnification formula,
           <br/>
           m = –\(\frac { v }{ u }\) = -(\(\frac { -60 }{ -20 }\)) or m = -3

<p>
           Question 45.
           <br/>
           To construct ray diagram we use two light rays which are so chosen that it is easy to know their directions after reflection from the mirror. List these two rays and state the path of these rays after reflection. Use these rays to locate the image of an object placed between centre of curvature and focus of a concave mirror. (AI2012)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A ray parallel to the principal axis, after reflection, will pass through the principal focus in case of a concave mirror or appear to diverge from the principal focus in case of a convex mirror.
          </p>
<p>
           A ray passing through the centre of a curvature of a concave mirror or directed in the direction of the centre of curvature of a convex mirror, after reflection, is reflected back along the same path. The light rays come back along the same path because the incident rays fall on the mirror along the normal to the reflecting surface.

           Question 48.
           <br/>
           With the help of a ray diagram explain why a convex mirror is preferred for rear view mirrors in the motor cars. (Foreign 2011)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Convex mirror is preferred for rear view mirrors in motor cars because no matter where the object is located in front of convex mirror, it always gives erect and diminished image of the object, so that driver is able to see the large traffic view in small area and the image is erect. This can be interpreted from the following diagram.

           Question 51.
           <br/>
           (a) A security mirror used in a big showroom has radius of curvature 5 m. If a customer is standing at a distance of 20 m from the cash counter, find the position, nature and size of the image formed in the security mirror.
           <br/>
           (b) Neha visited a dentist in his clinic. She observed that the dentist was holding an instrument fitted with a mirror. State the nature of this mirror and reason for its use in the instrument used by dentist. (2020)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Given radius of curvature of the mirror,
           <br/>
           R = 5 m
           <br/>
           ∴ Focal length, f = R/2 = 2.5 m (convex mirror) and u = -20 m
           <br/>
           From mirror formula,
           <br/>
           \(\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{v}+\frac{1}{u} \text { or } \frac{1}{v}=\frac{1}{f}-\frac{1}{u}\)
           <br/>
           = \(\frac{1}{2.5}-\frac{1}{-20}=\frac{-20-2.5}{-20 \times 2.5}\)
           <br/>
           ∴ v = 2.22 m
           <br/>
           Thus, the image is formed 2.22 m behind the mirror. The image is diminished, virtual and erect.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) Concave mirrors are used by dentist. Dentist use it as it is a converging mirror and when used at close range forms a highly enlarged, virtual and erect image of the object.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 52.
           <br/>
           (a) To construct a ray diagram we use two rays which are so chosen that it is easy to know their directions after reflection from the mirror. Use these two rays and draw ray diagram to locate the image of an object placed between pole and focus of a concave mirror.
           <br/>
           (b) A concave mirror produces three times magnified image on a screen. If the objects placed 20 cm in front of the mirror, how far is the screen from the object? (Delhi 2017)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Two lights rays whose path of reflection are priorly known are :
           <br/>
           (i) When the incident ray passes through the centre of curvature of a concave mirror, it gets reflected in the same path.
           <br/>
           (ii) When the ray is incident obliquely to the principal axis, towards the pole of mirror, it gets reflected back by making equal angles with the principal axis (laws of reflections).
          </p>
<p>
           Suppose an object is placed between focus and pole of the concave mirror. Then by using the above two rays, the image of the object can be located as
           <br/>
<img alt="Light Reflection and Refraction Class 10 Important Questions with Answers Science Chapter 10 Img 34" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-147032" height="156" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Light-Reflection-and-Refraction-Class-10-Important-Questions-with-Answers-Science-Chapter-10-Img-34.png" width="248"/>
<br/>
           Image formed is virtual, erect, magnified and it is formed behind the mirror.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) Given : Magnification, m = – 3
           <br/>
           Object distance, u = – 20 cm
           <br/>
           Magnification, m = \(\frac { -v }{ u }\) or -3 = \(\frac { -v }{ -20 }\)
           <br/>
           or v = -60 cm
           <br/>
           The screen is placed in front of the mirror at a distance of 60 cm from the pole.
           <br/>
           Thus, the screen is placed 40 cm (= 60 cm – 20 cm) away from the object.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 53.
           <br/>
           (a) If the image formed by a mirror for all positions of the object placed in front of it is always diminished, erect and virtual, state the type of the mirror and also draw a ray diagram to justify your answer. Write one use such mirrors are put to and why?
           <br/>
           (b) Define the radius of curvature of spherical mirrors. Find the nature and focal length of a spherical mirror whose radius of curvature is +24 cm. (AI2017)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) If the image formed by a mirror for all positions of the object placed in front of it is always diminished, erect and virtual then the mirror is convex mirror.
           <br/>
           The ray diagrams for the formation of image by a convex mirror for the first position when the object is at infinity and the second position when the object is at a finite distance from the mirror are shown.

<p>
           Use of Convex Mirrors
           <br/>
           Convex mirrors are commonly used as rear-view (wing) mirrors in vehicles because they always give an erect, though diminished image. Also, they have a wider field of view as they are curved outwards. Thus, convex mirrors enable the driver to view a large area.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) Radius of Curvature: The radius of the sphere of which the reflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part, is called the radius of curvature of the mirror. It is represented by the letter R.
           <br/>
           ∵ The radius of curvature is equal to twice the focal length.
           <br/>
           ∴ R = 2f
           <br/>
           If R = +24 cm ∴ f = \(\frac { R }{ 2 }\) = \(\frac { 24 }{ 2 }\) = 12 cm
           <br/>
           Since the radius of curvature is positive, the mirror is convex mirror. Hence the nature of the image is virtual and erect.

<br/>
           State the type of the mirror M and one characteristic property of the image Q. (Delhi 2016)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) (i) Pole : The centre of the reflecting surface of a spherical mirror is a point called the pole. It lies in the surface of the mirror and its represented by the letter P.
           <br/>
           (ii) Centre of curvature: The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror is a part of a sphere which has a centre. This point is called the centre of curvature of spherical mirror and is represented by the letter C.
           <br/>
           (iii) Principal axis : An imaginary line passing through the pole and the centre of curvature of a spherical mirror and normal to the mirror at its pole is called principal axis.
           <br/>
           (iv) Principal focus : Incident rays parallel to principal axis, after reflection either converge to as appear to diverge from a fixed point on the principal axis known as principal focus of the spherical mirror.

           (c) The object is placed between focus and pole of the mirror and a magnified image is formed behind the mirror.
           <br/>

           Question 56.
           <br/>
           Suppose you have three concave mirrors A, B and C of focal lengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 20 cm. For each concave mirror you perform the experiment of image formation for three values of object distances of 10 cm, 20 cm and 30 cm. By giving reason, answer the following:
           <br/>
           (a) For the three object distances, identify the mirror/mirrors which will form an image of magnification -1.
           <br/>
           (b) Out of the three mirrors, identify the mirror which would be preferred to be used for shaving purposes/make up.
           <br/>
           (c) For the mirror B draw ray diagram for image formation for object distances 10 cm and 20 cm. (Foreign 2016)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Given f
           <sub>
            a
           </sub>
           = 10 cm, f
           <sub>
            b
           </sub>
           = 15 cm, f
           <sub>
            c
           </sub>
           = 20 cm
           <br/>
           u
           <sub>
            a
           </sub>
           = 10 cm, u
           <sub>
            b
           </sub>
           = 20 cm, u
           <sub>
            c
           </sub>
           = 30 cm
          </p>
<p>
           (a) Magnification of -1 implies that size of image is same as that of object or image is formed at the same distance as of the object. This is the case when the object distance, u = 2f, i.e., when the object is at the centre of the curvature.
           <br/>
           For f
           <sub>
            a
           </sub>
           , u
           <sub>
            b
           </sub>
           and for f
           <sub>
            b
           </sub>
           , u
           <sub>
            c
           </sub>
           , we get magnification – 1.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) Concave mirror forms virtual, erect and magnified image when the object is between focus and pole of the mirror, i.e., direct distance should be less than the focal length of the mirror.
           <br/>
           For object distance 10 cm, mirrors of focal length f
           <sub>
            b
           </sub>
           = 15 cm and f
           <sub>
            c
           </sub>
           = 20 cm can be used.

           Question 57.
           <br/>
           A student has focused the image of a candle flame on a white screen using a concave mirror. The situation is a given below:
           <br/>
           Length of fhe flame = 1.5 cm
           <br/>
           Focal length of the mirror = 12 cm
           <br/>
           Distance of flame from the mirror = 18 cm
           <br/>
           If the flame is perpendicular to the principal axis of the mirror, then calculate the following:
           <br/>
           (a) Distance of the image from the mirror
           <br/>
           (b) Length of the image
           <br/>
           If the distance between the mirror and the flame is reduced to 10 cm, then what would be observed on the screen? Draw ray diagram to justify your answer from this situation. (Foreign 2015)

           Answer:
           <br/>
           Given: focal length of the concave mirror, f = – 12 cm
           <br/>
           Length of the flame, h = 1.5 cm
           <br/>

<br/>
           (b) Let h’ be the length of the image.
           <br/>
           ∵ Magnification, m = \(\frac { h’ }{ h }\) = \(\frac { -v }{ u }\)
           <br/>
           ∴ h’ = \(\frac{-v \times h}{u}=\frac{-(-36) \times 1.5}{-18}\) = -3 cm
           <br/>
           If the distance between the mirror and the flame is reduced to 10 cm, then
           <br/>
           \(\frac{1}{v}=\frac{1}{f}-\frac{1}{u}=\frac{1}{-12}-\frac{1}{-10}=\frac{1}{60}\)
           <br/>
           ∴ v = 60 cm
           <br/>
           Hence, image is formed behind the mirror.

           Question 59.
           <br/>
           Define the following terms in case of a concave mirror:
           <br/>
           (a) Pole
           <br/>
           (b) Radius of curvature
           <br/>
           (c) Principal axis
           <br/>

           Question 60.
           <br/>
           List the sign conventions for reflection of light by spherical mirrors. Draw a diagram and apply these conventions in the determination of focal length of a spherical mirror which forms a three times magnified real image of an object placed 16 cm infront of it. (Delhi 2012)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Sign Convention for Reflection by Spherical Mirrors : While dealing with the reflection of light by spherical mirrors, we shall follow a set of sign conventions called the New Cartesian Sign Convention, the conventions are as follows:
           <br/>
           (i) The object is always placed to the left of the mirror. This implies that the light from the object falls on the mirror from the left-hand side.
           <br/>
           (ii) All distances parallel to the principal axis are measured from the pole of the mirror.
           <br/>
           (iii) All the distances measured to the right of the origin (along + x-axis) are taken as positive while those measured to the left of the origin (along – x-axis) are taken as negative.
           <br/>
           (iv) Distances measured perpendicular to and above the principal axis (along +y-axis) are taken as positive.
           <br/>
           (v) Distances measured perpendicular to and below the principal axis (along-y-axis) are taken as negative.

           Question 61.
           <br/>
           List the new Cartesian sign convention for reflection of light by spherical mirrors. Draw a diagram and apply these conventions for calculating the focal length and nature of a spherical mirror which forms a 1/3 times magnified virtual image of an object placed 18 cm in front of it. (AI 2012)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Refer to answer 60.
           <br/>
           Given that m = +\(\frac { 1 }{ 3 }\) (virtual image), u = -18 cm
           <br/>
           Magnification, m = –\(\frac { v }{ u }\)
           <br/>
           \(\frac { 1 }{ 3 }\) = \(\frac { -v }{ -18 }\) ⇒ v = 6 cm
           <br/>
           mirror formula \(\frac { 1 }{ v }\) + \(\frac { 1 }{ u }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ f }\)
           <br/>
           \(\frac { 1 }{ 6 }\) – \(\frac { 1 }{ 18 }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ f }\) ⇒ \(\frac { 3-1 }{ 18 }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ f }\) ⇒ f = 9 cm
           <br/>
           As the value of focal length is positive, the mirror used is convex mirror.

           <br/>
           (i) Refer to answer 46(i).
           <br/>
           (ii) Refer to answer 46(ii).
           <br/>

           Question 63.
           <br/>
           What is meant by power of a lens? (Delhi 2015)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Power is the degree of convergence or divergence of light rays achieved by a lens.
           <br/>
           It is defined as the reciprocal of its focal length.
           <br/>
           i.e., P = \(\frac { 1 }{ f }\)
           <br/>
           Question 64.
           <br/>
           An object is placed at a distance of 15 cm from a convex lens of focal length 20 cm. List four characteristics (nature, position, etc.) of the image formed by the lens. (AI2017)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Given : Object distance, u = – 15 cm
           <br/>
           Focal length, f = + 20 cm
           <br/>
           Using lens formula, As |u| &lt; |f|
           <br/>
           The object is placed between F and optical centre of lens.
           <br/>
           Thus, the four characteristics of the image formed by the convex lens are:
           <br/>
           (i) Erect
           <br/>
           (ii) Virtual
           <br/>
           (iii) Enlarged image,
           <br/>
           (iv) Image is formed on the same side of the lens as the object.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 65.
           <br/>
           What is meant by power of a lens? What does its sign (+ve or -ve) indicate? State its S.I. unit related to focal length of a lens. (Delhi 2016)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Refer to answer 63.
           <br/>
           Positive sign (+) of power indicates that lens is convex and negative sign (-) of power indicates that lens is concave.
           <br/>
           If focal length (f) is expressed in metres, then, power is expressed in dioptres. The SI unit of power is dioptre. Thus, 1 dioptre is the power of lens whose focal length is 1 metre. 1 D = 1 m

           Question 69.
           <br/>
           The absolute refractive indices of glass and water are 1.5 and 1.33 respectively. In which medium does light travel faster? Calculate the ratio of speeds of light in the two media. (Delhi 2013 C)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Given : refractive index of glass, n

<br/>
           For glass n
           <sub>

           = \(\frac { c }{ v_g }\) ……… (i)

<p>
           Since velocity of light in medium is inversely proportional to its refractive index, the light will travel faster in optically rarer medium i.e., water.

           Question 70.
           <br/>
           To construct a ray diagram we use two light rays which are so chosen that it is easy to know their directions after refraction from the lens. List these two rays and state the path of these rays after refraction. Use these two rays to locate the image of an object placed between ‘f’ and ‘2f’ of a convex lens. (Foreign 2012)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The two rays are :
           <br/>
           (i) A ray of light from the object, parallel to the principal axis, after refraction from a convex lens, passes through the principal focus on the other side of the leps and in case of concave lens, a ray appears to diverge from the principal focus located on the same side of the lens.

           Question 71.
           <br/>
           (a) Water has refractive index 1.33 and alcohol has refractive index 1.36. Which of the two medium is optically denser? Give reason for your answer.
           <br/>
           (b) Draw a ray diagram to show the path of a ray of light passing obliquely from water to alcohol.
           <br/>
           (c) State the relationship between angle of incidence and angle of refraction in the above case. (2020)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Here, alcohol is optically denser medium as its refractive index is higher than that of water. When we compare the two media, the one with larger refractive index is called the optically denser medium than the other as the speed of light is lower in this medium.
           <br/>
           (b) Since light is travelling from water (rarer medium) to alcohol (denser medium), it slows down and bends towards the normal.

<br/>
           where i = angle of incidence and r = angle of refraction.
           <br/>
           (c) According to Snell’s law,
           <br/>
           \(\frac{\sin i}{\sin r}=\frac{\mu_{\text {alcohol }}}{\mu_{\text {water }}}=\frac{1.36}{1.33}\) = 1.0225

           Question 74.
           <br/>
           State the laws of refraction of light. Explain the term absolute refractive index of a medium’ and write an expression to relate it with the speed of light in vaccum. (2018)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Laws of refraction of light:
           <br/>
           (i) The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal to the interface of two transparent media at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane.
           <br/>
           (ii) The ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is constant, for the light of a given colour and for the given pair of media.
           <br/>
           This law is also known as Snell’s law of refraction.
           <br/>
           \(\frac { sin i }{ sin r }\) = constant,
           <br/>
           where i is the angle of incidence and r is the angle of refraction.
           <br/>
           This constant value is called refractive index of the second medium with respect to the first when the light travels from first medium to second medium.
           <br/>
           ⇒ constant = n
           <sub>
            21
           </sub>
           = \(\frac { v_1 }{ v_2 }\) ∴\(\frac { sin i }{ sin r }\) = \(\frac { v_1 }{ v_2 }\)
           <br/>
           If n is the absolute refractive index of the medium, c is the velocity of light in vacuum and v is the speed of light in a given medium, then n = cl v.

           Question 78.
           <br/>
           The image of an object formed by a lens is of magnification -1. If the distance between the object and its image is 60 cm, what is the focal length of the lens? If the object is moved 20 cm towards the lens, where would the image be formed? State reason and also draw a ray diagram in support of your answer. (AI2016)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Magnification of -1 indicates that the image is real and inverted and is of the same size as of the object. The object must be at 2f and image also at 2f on the other side.
           <br/>
           Total distance between image and object
           <br/>
           Also 4f = 60 cm ⇒ f = 15 cm
           <br/>
           If object is moved 20 cm towards the lens, then the object will be between focus and optical centre of the lens and image formed will be virtual and erect and on the same side of the lens.

           Question 83.
           <br/>
           The image of a candle flame placed at a distance of 40 cm from a spherical lens is formed on a screen placed on the other side of the lens at a distance of 40 cm from the lens. Identify the type of lens and write its focal length. What will be the nature of the image formed if the candle flame is shifted 25 cm towards the lens? Draw a ray diagram to justify your answer. (Foreign 2014)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Given : u = -40 cm, v = 40 cm
           <br/>
           \(\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{40}+\frac{1}{40}=\frac{2}{40}\) ⇒ f = 20 cm
           <br/>
           Type of lens : Convex lens
           <br/>
           Focal length = 20 cm
           <br/>
           Nature of the image will be virtual and erect if the candle flame is shifted 25 cm towards the lens.

           Question 84.
           <br/>
           An object of height 6 cm is placed perpendicular to the principal axis of a concave lens of focal length 5 cm. Use lens formula to determine the position, size and nature of the image if the distance of the object from the lens is 10 cm. (Delhi 2013)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Focal length of given concave lens, f= – 5 cm
           <br/>
           Distance, u = -10 cm, object size, h = 6 cm
           <br/>
           Image distance, v = ?
           <br/>
           Using lens formula, \(\frac { 1 }{ f }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ v }\) – \(\frac { 1 }{ u }\)
           <br/>
           \(\frac{1}{v}=\frac{1}{f}+\frac{1}{u}=\frac{1}{-5}+\frac{1}{-10}=\frac{-3}{10}\)
           <br/>
           v = –\(\frac { 10 }{ u }\) = -3.33 cm
           <br/>
           So, the image is located 3.33 cm from the lens. Magnification (m) of lens is given by
           <br/>
           m = \(\frac { v }{ u }\) = \(\frac{-\frac{10}{3}}{-10}=\frac{1}{3}\) = 0.33
           <br/>
           m is positive implies that image is virtual and erect. Also, magnitude of m is less than one implies that image is diminished.
           <br/>
           Since m = \(\frac { v }{ u }\) = \(\frac { h’ }{ h }\) ⇒ \(\frac { 1 }{ 3 }\) = \(\frac { h’ }{ 6 }\) or h’ = 2 cm

<br/>
           The refracted ray appears to pass through focus on the same side of the lens.
           <br/>
           (ii) If a ray of light incident on a concave lens is passing through its optical centre then the refracted ray will go without deviation.

           Question 86.
           <br/>
           What is the principle of reversibility of light? Show that the incident of light is parallel to the emergent ray of light when light falls obliquely on a side of a rectangular glass slab. (AI 2011)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Principle of reversibility of light states that the light will follow exactly the same path if the direction is reversed.
           <br/>
           Using Snell’s law of refraction, \(\frac{\sin i}{\sin r_{1}}=\frac{\sin e}{\sin r_{2}}\)
           <br/>
           Since r
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           = r
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           , so i = e

<br/>
           so PQ is parallel to RS.
           <br/>
           So, we conclude that incident ray is parallel to the emergent ray.

           Question 87.
           <br/>
           What is understood by lateral displacement of light? Illustrate it with the help of a diagram. List any two factors on which the lateral displacement in a particular substance depends. (Foreign 2011)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When a ray of light is incident obliquely on a parallel sided glass slab, the emergent ray shifts laterally. The perpendicular distance between the direction of the incident ray and emergent ray is called lateral shift.
           <br/>
           Diagram : Refer to answer 68.
           <br/>
           Tire factors on which the lateral displacement depends are:

           Question 90.
           <br/>
           Rishi went to a palmist to show his palm. The palmist used a special lens for this purpose.
           <br/>
           (i) State the nature of the lens and reason for its use.
           <br/>
           (ii) Where should the palmist place/hold the lens so as to have a real and magnified image of an object?
           <br/>
           (iii) If the focal length of this lens is 10 cm, the lens is held at a distance of 5 cm from the palm, use lens formula to find the position and size of the image. (2020)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) The lens used here is a convex lens and it is used as a magnifying glass because at close range, i.e., when the object is placed between optic centre and principal focus it forms an enlarged, virtual and erect image of the object.
           <br/>
           (ii) When this lens is placed such that the object is between the centre of curvature and the principal focus, the palmist obtain a real and magnified image.
           <br/>
           (iii) Given focal length, f = 10 cm and u = -5 cm According to lens formula,
           <br/>
<img alt="Light Reflection and Refraction Class 10 Important Questions with Answers Science Chapter 10 Img 74" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-147072" height="132" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Light-Reflection-and-Refraction-Class-10-Important-Questions-with-Answers-Science-Chapter-10-Img-74.png" width="217"/>

           An object is placed at a distance of 60 cm from a concave lens of focal length 30 cm.
           <br/>
           (i) Use lens formula to find the distance of the image from the lens
           <br/>
           (ii) List four characteristics of the image (nature, position, size, erect/inverted) formed by the lens in this case
           <br/>
           (iii) Draw ray diagram to justify your answer of pair (ii) . (Delhi 2019)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Given, f = -30 cm, u = -60 cm, v = ?

<br/>
           (ii) (a) The image is virtual in nature.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) The image is formed at a distance of 20 cm on the left from the concave lens.
           <br/>
           (c) Magnification, m = \(\frac { v }{ u }\)
           <br/>
           Here, v = – 20 cm; u = – 60 cm
           <br/>
           So, m = \(\frac { 20 }{ 60 }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ 3 }\) = + 0.3
           <br/>
           Since value of magnification is less than 1, therefore, the image is diminished.
           <br/>
           (d) The plus sign for the magnification shows that the image is erect.

           (a) A 5 cm tall object is placed perpendicular to the principal axis of a convex lens of focal length 20 cm. The distance of the object from the lens is 30 cm. Find the position, nature and size of the image formed.
           <br/>
           (b) Draw a labelled ray diagram showing object distance, image distance and focal length in the above case. (AI 2019)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Given, h = 5 cm, f = 20 cm, u = -30 cm
           <br/>
           Using lens formula, \(\frac { 1 }{ v }\) – \(\frac { 1 }{ u }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ f }\)
           <br/>
           \(\frac{1}{v}=\frac{1}{u}+\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{-30}+\frac{1}{20}=\frac{-2+3}{60}=\frac{1}{60}\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ v = 60 cm
           <br/>
           Now, magnification, m = \(\frac { h’ }{ h }\) = \(\frac { v }{ u }\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ h’ = \(\frac { v }{ u }\) × h = \(\frac {60 }{ -30 }\) × 5 = -10 cm
           <br/>
           Hence, the image formed at 60 cm, which is real and magnified.

           (a) What is the focal length of the convex lens? Give reason in support of your answer.
           <br/>
           (b) Write the serial number of that observation which is not correct. How did you arrive at this conclusion?
           <br/>
           (c) Take an appropriate scale to draw ray diagram for the observation at S. No. 4 and the approximate value of magnification. (Delhi 2017)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) When an object placed at 2F from a convex lens, then its image is formed on the other side of the lens at the same distance from the lens. Thus from S. No.(3) we can say that.
           <br/>
           f = v/2 ⇒ f = \(\frac {30}{ 2 }\) = + 15 cm
           <br/>
           Thus, the focal length is + 15 cm.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) In this case S.No. (6) is incorrect as the object distance is between focus and pole, for such case, the image formed is virtual and on the same side as the object, hence image distance is negative.
          </p>
<p>
           (c) The approximate value of magnification for object distance -20 cm and image distance +60 cm is -3

           Question 95.
           <br/>
           (a) Draw a ray diagram to show the formation of image by a convex lens when an object is placed in front of the lens between its optical centre and principal focus.
           <br/>
           (b) In the above ray diagram mark the object distance (u) and the image distance (v) with their proper sign (+ve or -ve as per the new Cartesian sign convention) and state how these distances are related to the focal length (f) of the convex lens in this case.
           <br/>
           (c) Find the power of a convex lens which forms a real and inverted image of magnification -1 of an object placed at a distance of 20 cm from its optical centre. (Delhi 2016)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Refer to answer 88(i).
           <br/>
           (b) The lens formula is given as
           <br/>
           \(\frac { 1 }{ v }\) – \(\frac { 1 }{ u }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ f }\)
           <br/>
           (c) Magnification of the lens is given by
           <br/>
           m = \(\frac { v }{ u }\) ⇒ -1 = \(\frac { -v }{ 20 }\) [u = -20 cm]
           <br/>
           ∴ v = 20 cm
           <br/>
           As v = u then
           <br/>
           ∴ f = \(\frac { 20 }{ 2 }\) cm = 10 cm = 0.1 m
           <br/>
           Power of the lens, P = \(\frac { 1 }{ f(in m) }\) D = \(\frac { 1}{ 0.1 }\) D = 10 D

           Question 96.
           <br/>
           (a) Draw a ray diagram to show the formation of image by a concave lens when an object is placed in front of it.
           <br/>
           (b) In the above diagram mark the object distance (u) and the image distance (v) with their proper sign (+ve or -ve as per the new Cartesian sign convention) and state how these distances are related to the focal length (/) of the concave lens in this case.
           <br/>
           (c) Find the nature and power of a lens which forms a real and inverted image of magnification -1 at a distance of 40 cm from its optical centre. (Delhi 2016)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Refer to answer 88(ii).
           <br/>
           (b) The lens formula is given by
           <br/>
           \(\frac { 1 }{ v }\) – \(\frac { 1 }{ u }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ f }\)
           <br/>
           (c) Since, the nature of the image is real and inverted therefore the lens is convex.
           <br/>
           Now magnification of the lens is
           <br/>
           m = \(\frac { v }{ u }\) ⇒ -1 = \(\frac { v }{ u}\) ⇒ v = -u
           <br/>
           Now, from lens formula,

           (c) Draw a ray diagram to show the formation of image in above situation. (AI 2016)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Optical centre is the central part of the lens through which a ray of light passes without suffering any deviation. It is usually represented by the letter O.
           <br/>
           (b) Given f = – 20 cm, h = 4 cm, v = – 10 cm

           From lens formula,
           <br/>
           \(\frac { 1 }{ v }\) – \(\frac { 1 }{ u }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ f }\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ \(\frac { 1 }{ u }\) = \(\frac { -1 }{ 10 }\) + \(\frac { 1 }{ 20 }\) ⇒ u = -20 cm
           <br/>
           Also, magnification of the lens,
           <br/>

           Given that h = 4 cm, u = -20 cm, f = -10 cm
           <br/>
           Lens formula:
           <br/>
           \(\frac { 1 }{ v }\) – \(\frac { 1 }{ u }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ f }\) ∴ \(\frac { 1 }{ v }\) – \(\frac { 1 }{ (-20) }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ (-10) }\)
           <br/>
           or \(\frac{1}{v}=\frac{-1}{10}-\frac{1}{20}=\frac{-2-1}{20}=\frac{-3}{20}\) or v = \(\frac { -20 }{ 3 }\) cm

           Question 102.
           <br/>
           The image of a candle flame placed at a distance of 30 cm from a spherical lens is formed on a screen placed on the other side of the lens at a distance of 60 cm from the optical centre of the lens. Identify the type of lens and calculate its focal length. If the height of the flame is 3 cm, find the height of its image. (Delhi 2015)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Given that u = -30 cm, v = 60 cm, h = 3 cm
           <br/>
           Lens Formula:
           <br/>
           \(\frac { 1 }{ v }\) – \(\frac { 1 }{ u }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ f }\) ∴ \(\frac { 1 }{ 60 }\) – \(\frac { 1 }{ (-30) }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ f }\)
           <br/>
           ⇒ \(\frac{1+2}{60}=\frac{1}{f}=\frac{3}{60}=\frac{1}{20}\) or f = 20 cm
           <br/>
           As focal length is positive, hence lens is convex lens.
           <br/>
           Magnification, m = \(\frac { v }{ u }\) = \(\frac { h’ }{ h }\)
           <br/>
           ∴ \(\frac { 60 }{ -30 }\) = \(\frac { h’ }{ 3 }\) or h’ = \(\frac { -60×3 }{ 30 }\) = -6 cm
           <br/>
           ⇒ The height of image is 6 cm and negative sign shows that the image is real and inverted.

           Question 111.
           <br/>
           The image of a candle flame placed at a distance of 45 cm from a spherical lens is formed on a screen placed at a distance of 90 cm from the lens. Identify the type of lens and calculate its focal length. If the height of the flame is 2 cm, find the height of its image. (Delhi 2012)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Given that u = -45 cm, v = +90 cm, h = 2 cm
           <br/>
           (as the image is formed on the screen, the image is real and hence image is formed by convex lens on the other side of the lens).
           <br/>
           Type of the lens used : Convex lens
           <br/>
           Lens formula
           <br/>
           \(\frac { 1 }{ v }\) – \(\frac { 1 }{ u }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ f }\)

           <br/>
           With the help of a ray diagram state what is meant by refraction of light. State Snell’s law for refraction of light and also express it mathematically.
           <br/>
           The refractive index of air with respect to glass is 2/3 and the refractive index of water with respect to air is 4/3. If the speed of light in glass is 2 × 10
           <sup>

           m/s, find the speed of light in (a) air, (b) water. (AI 2012)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When travelling obliquely from one medium to another, the direction of propagation of light in the second medium changes. This phenomenon is known as refraction of light.
           <br/>
           The ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is constant, for the light of a given colour and for the given pair of media. This law is also known as snell’s law of refraction.

           Question 115.
           <br/>
           List the sign conventions that are followed in case of refraction of light through spherical lenses. Draw a diagram and apply these conventions in determining the nature and focal length of a spherical lens which forms three times magnified real image of an object placed 16 cm from the lens. (Foreign 2012)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           For lenses, we follow sign convention, similar to one used for spherical mirrors. We apply the rules for signs of distances, except that all measurements are taken from the optical centre of the lens.
           <br/>
           For sign convention of mirror : refer to answer 60.

           Question 116.
           <br/>
           (a) What is meant by ‘power of a lens?’
           <br/>
           (b) State and define the S.I unit of power of a lens.
           <br/>
           (c) A convex lens of focal length 25 cm and a concave lens of focal length 10 cm are placed in close contact with each other. Calculate the lens power of this combination. (AI 2011)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) Refer to answer 63.
           <br/>
           (b) Refer to answer 65.
           <br/>
           (c) Power of convex lens of focal length 25 cm is
           <br/>
           p
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           = \(\frac { 100 }{ 25(in m) }\) = 4 D
           <br/>
           Power of concave lens of focal length 10 cm is 100
           <br/>
           p
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           = \(\frac { 100 }{ -10(in m) }\) = -10 D
           <br/>
           ∴ Power of the combination = P = P
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           + P
           <sub>
            2

           Question 117.
           <br/>
           (a) Under what condition with a glass lens placed in a transparent liquid become invisible.
           <br/>
           (b) Describe and illustrate with a diagram, how we should arrange two converging lenses so that a parallel beam of light entering one lens emerges as a parallel beam after passing through the second lens.
           <br/>
           (c) An object is placed at a distance of 3 cm from a concave lens of focal length 12 cm. Find the (i) position and (ii) nature of the image formed. (Foreign 2011)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (a) If the refractive index of glass lens is equal to the refractive index of liquid then the glass lens placed in a transparent liquid will become invisible.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) Suppose we have two converging lens of focal lengths f
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           and f
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           . We will keep the two converging lens at a distance of f
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           +f
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           so that a parallel beam of light entering one lens emerges as a parallel beam after passing through the second lens.
           <br/>
<img alt="Light Reflection and Refraction Class 10 Important Questions with Answers Science Chapter 10 Img 96" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-147094" height="107" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Light-Reflection-and-Refraction-Class-10-Important-Questions-with-Answers-Science-Chapter-10-Img-96.png" width="270"/>
<br/>
           Here the focus of the two lenses should coincide,
           <br/>
           (c) (i) Focal length of concave lens, f = -12 cm
           <br/>
           Object distance, u = -3 cm Image distance, v = ?
           <br/>
           Using lens formula,
           <br/>
<img alt="Light Reflection and Refraction Class 10 Important Questions with Answers Science Chapter 10 Img 97" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-147095" height="145" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Light-Reflection-and-Refraction-Class-10-Important-Questions-with-Answers-Science-Chapter-10-Img-97.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Light-Reflection-and-Refraction-Class-10-Important-Questions-with-Answers-Science-Chapter-10-Img-97.png 310w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Light-Reflection-and-Refraction-Class-10-Important-Questions-with-Answers-Science-Chapter-10-Img-97-300x140.png 300w" width="310"/>
<br/>
           So, the image is formed at 2.4 cm from the concave lens.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Using magnification formula,
           <br/>
           m = \(\frac { v }{ u }\) = \(\frac { -2.4 }{ -3 }\) = + 0.8
           <br/>
           Since m is +ve and magnitude of m is less than 1, so the image formed is virtual and diminished.
