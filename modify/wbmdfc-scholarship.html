           </strong>
           To address the growing aspiration for education in the minority communities of the state and with a view to providing them more avenues for socio-economic and educational mobility by extending financial support and encouragement to the meritorious students belonging to the minority communities, the State Government has decided to set up the “Aikyashree” – West Bengal State Scholarships for Minority Students in West Bengal to be fully funded from the State budget from the financial year 2023-2024 onwards.
