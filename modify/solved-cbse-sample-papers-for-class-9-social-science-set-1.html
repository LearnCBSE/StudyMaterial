           Question 9:
           <br/>
           Describe the impact of First World War on European society and polity.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The First World War left a deep impact on European society and polity.
           <br/>
           Soldiers came to be placed above civilians. Politicians and publicists laid great stress on the need for men to be aggressive, strong and masculine. The media glorified trench life. The truth, however, was the soldiers lived miserable lives in these trenches, trapped with rats feeding on corpses. They faced poisonous gas and enemy shelling and witnessed their ranks reduce rapidly. Aggressive war propaganda and national honour occupied centre stage in the public sphere, while popular support grew for conservative dictatorships that had recently come into being.

           Question 10:
           <br/>

           <br/>

           <br/>
           India is a vast country situated between longitudes 68°7’E and 97°25’E. Due to almost 30°
           <br/>
           longitudinal extent of mainland, there is a time lag of 2 hours between Gujarat and Arunachal Pradesh. Hence, time along the Standard Meridian of India (82°30’E) passing through Mirzapur (in U.P.) is taken as the standard time for the whole country.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 11:
           <br/>
           Describe any three important features of the Krishna Basin.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) The Krishna river rises from a spring near Mahabaleshwar, flows eastward for about 1400 km and reaches the Bay of Bengal.
           <br/>
           (ii) Its important tributaries are : the Tungabhadra, the Koyana, the Ghatprabha, the Musi and the Bhima.

The Westerns Ghats and the Eastern Ghats mark the western and eastern edges of the Deccan Plateau respectively.
          </p>

           Question 16:
           <br/>
           State three reasons of calling raw material and money as working capital.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Production requires a variety of raw materials such as the yam used by a weaver and the clay used by a potter.
           <br/>
           (ii) Some amount of money is always required during production to make various payments and buy other necessary items.
           <br/>
           (iii) Unlike tools, machines and buildings, raw materials and money are directly used up in production.

           Question 17:
           <br/>
           Modern farming methods require more inputs which are manufactured in the industry. Why?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Modem farming methods require tractors, threshers, combines to plough land and harvest crops. Fertilisers, pesticides and weedicides are required in large quantities. These are manufactured in the industries. Modem means of irrigation such as tube-wells, pumpsets, sprinklers are manufactured in factories. HYV seeds require plenty of irrigation, chemical fertilisers, pesticides. All of these inputs are supplied by industries.

           Question 18:
           <br/>
           Define production. Explain the role of labour in production.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Production is to produce the goods and services that we want. There are four requirements for
           <br/>
           production of goods and services – land, labour, capital, knowledge and enterprise.
           <br/>
           Labour is an important factor of production. A producer needs people who will do the work. Some activities require skilled and semi-skilled labour whereas others require workers who can do manual work. Each worker is providing the labour necessary for production.

           Question 19A:
           <br/>
           Explain any four ideas of Dietrich Brandis for the management of forests in India during British period.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Dietrich Brandis was a German forest expert, who was appointed the first Inspector General of Forests in India.
           <br/>
           (i) Brandis proposed that a proper system had to be introduced to manage the forests and people had to be trained in the
           <br/>
           science of conservation. This system required royal sanction.
           <br/>
           (ii) Rules about the use of forest resources had to be framed.
           <br/>
           (iii) Felling of trees and grazing had to be restricted so that forests could be preserved for timber production. Anybody who cut trees without following the system had to be punished.
           <br/>
           (iv) Brandis set up the Indian Forest Service in 1864 and helped formulate the Indian Forest Act of 1865. The Imperial Forest Research Institute was set up at Dehradun in 1906. The students at the institute were taught scientific forestry.

           Question 19B:
           <br/>
           Why are Maasais of Africa continuously losing their grazing grounds? Explain any four reasons.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) In the late 19th century, European imperial powers scrambled for territorial possessions in Africa, slicing up the Maasailand into different categories.
           <br/>
           (ii) In 1885, Maasailand was cut into half with an international boundary between British Kenya and German Tanganyika.
           <br/>
           (iii) The best grazing lands were gradually taken over for white settlement and the Maasai were pushed into a small area in south Kenya and north Tanzania. Thus, the Maasai lost about 60 per cent of their pre-colonial lands.
           <br/>
           (iv) From the late 19th century, the British colonial government in east Africa also encouraged local peasant communities to expand cultivation. As cultivation expanded, pasture lands were turned into cultivated fields.

           Question 19C:
           <br/>
           How did the Enclosure Movement benefit Britain? Explain any four benefits.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) In earlier times, rapid population growth was most often followed by a period of food shortages. After the Enclosure Movement, grain production grew as quickly as population. In 1868, England produced about 80 per cent of the food it consumed.
           <br/>
           (ii) Landlords sliced up pasture lands, carved up open fields, cut up forest commons, took over marshes, and turned larger and larger areas into agricultural fields.
           <br/>
           (iii) To restore fertility and increase production, farmers began growing turnip and clover. Enclosures were now seen as necessary to make long-term investments on land and plan crop rotations to improve the fertility of the soil.

           Question 20A:
           <br/>
           Describe the similarities in effects caused by colonial policies on the lives of Indians and African nomads.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The colonial policies led to a serious shortage of pastures. As grazing lands were taken over and converted into cultivable fields, available pastures disappeared. Reservation of forests put a restriction on shepherds and cattle herders as they could no longer freely graze their cattle in the forests. This led to continuous intensive grazing over remaining pastures. This, in turn, created further shortage of forage for animals. Animal stock declined and underfed cattle died in large numbers during scarcities and famines.

           Question 20B:
           <br/>
           The spread of railways from the 1850s created which new demands on the
           <br/>
           Indian forests and how were they met with? Explain.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The spread of railways from the 1850s created a new demand. Railways were essential for colonial trade and for the movement of imperial troops. To run locomotives, wood was needed as fuel, and to lay railway lines sleepers were essential to hold the tracks together. Each mile of railway track required between 1,760 and 2,000 sleepers.
           <br/>
           From the 1860, the railway network expanded rapidly. By 1890, about 25,500 km of track had been laid. In 1946, the length of the tracks had increased to over 765,000 km. As the railway tracks spread through India, a larger and larger number of trees were felled. As early as the 1850, in the Madras Presidency alone, 35,000 trees were being cut annually for sleepers. The government gave out contracts to individuals to supply the required quantities. These contractors began cutting trees indiscriminately. Forests around the railway tracks fast started disappearing.

           Question 20C:
           <br/>
           Why were the British keen on growing opium in India?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In the late 18th Century, English East India Company bought large quantities of tea and silk from China for sale in England. As tea became a popular drink in England, by 1830, 30 million Pounds of tea was exported to England. But England at that time produced nothing that could be easily sold in China. The Manchu rulers were not willing to allow entry of foreign goods into China. This meant western merchants had to spend a large number of silver coins or bullions to buy Chinese tea and silk. This meant an outflow of treasure from England. So, the merchants began looking for ways to stop loss of bullion. So, western merchants began illegal trade of opium in China to finance their purchase of Chinese tea. Chinese became addicted to opium. Bengal and Bihar became the areas where the opium was grown in large quantity.

           Question 21:
           <br/>
           How is the climate of India governed by the atmospheric conditions? Explain with three suitable examples.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The climate of India is governed by three atmospheric conditions :
           <br/>
           (i) Pressure and surface winds
           <br/>
           (ii) Upper air circulation
           <br/>
           (iii) Western cyclonic disturbances and tropical cyclones
           <br/>
           The pressure and wind conditions over India are unique. During winter, high pressure develops north of the Himalayas, and cold dry winds blow to the south. In summer, a low pressure area develops over interior Asia as well as over north-western India. This causes complete reversal of winds. These winds blow over the ocean and get moisture. They bring rainfall over India. The upper air circulation in the region is dominated by westerly flow. The jet stream is an important flow. These jet streams are located approximately over 27°-30° north latitude. Over India these jet streams blow south of the Himalayas.
           <br/>
           The western disturbances experienced in the north and most western parts of the country are brought in by the westerly flow.

           Question 22:
           <br/>
           In which four ways does parliament exercise political authority on behalf of the people?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Parliament is the final authority for making laws in any country. Parliaments all over the world can make new laws, change existing laws, or abolish existing laws and make new ones in their place.
           <br/>
           (ii) Parliaments all over the world exercise some control over those who run the government. In some countries like India this control is direct and full. The government can take decisions only so long as they enjoy support of the parliament.
           <br/>
           (iii) In most countries the public money can be spent only when the parliament sanctions it.
           <br/>
           (iv) Parliament is the highest forum for discussion and debate on public issues and national ’ policy in any country.

           Question 23:
           <br/>
           What do you mean by the Rule of Law?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Constitution says that the government shall not deny to any person in India equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws. It means that the laws apply in the same manner to all, regardless of a person’s status. This is called the rule of law. Rule of law is the foundation of any democracy. It means that no person is above the law. There cannot be any distinction between a political leader, government official and an ordinary citizen. Every citizen, from the Prime Minister to a small farmer in a remote village, is subjected to the same laws. No person can legally claim any special treatment or privilege just because he or she happens to be an important person. The rule of law is further clarified in the Constitution by spelling out some implication of the Right to Equality.

           Question 24:
           <br/>
           Which states are more food insecure in India?
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The food insecure people are disproportionately large in some regions of the country, such as economically backward states with high incidence of poverty, tribal and remote areas, regions more prone to natural disasters, etc. The states of Uttar Pradesh (eastern and south-eastern parts), Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and parts of Maharashtra account for the largest number of food insecure people in the country.

<p>
           Question 25:
           <br/>
           How is poverty line estimated in India? Mention three dimensions of food security.
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           A common method used to measure poverty is based on the income or consumption levels.
           <br/>
           While determining the poverty line in India, minimum level of food requirement, clothing, footwear, fuel and light, educational and medical requirements, etc. are determined for subsistence. These physical quantities are multiplied by their prices in rupees. The present formula for food requirement while estimating the poverty line is based on the desired calorie requirement. The accepted average calorie requirement in India is 2400 calories per person per day in urban areas. Food security means affording more than getting two square meals. It has following dimensions:
           <br/>
           (i) Availability of food : It means food production within the country, food imports and the previous years stock stored in government granaries.
           <br/>
           (ii) Accessibility : This means that food should be within reach of every person. It should not be available at far-off places.
           <br/>
           (iii) Affordability : This implies that an individual has enough money to buy sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet one’s dietary needs.
