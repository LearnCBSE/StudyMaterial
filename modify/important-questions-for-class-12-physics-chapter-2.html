           Electrostatic Potential and Capacitance Class 12 Important Questions Very Short Answer Type
          </h3>
<p>
           Question 1.
           <br/>
           A 500 µC charge is at the centre of a square of side 10 cm. Find the work done in moving a charge of 10 µC between two diagonally opposite points on the square. (Delhi 2008)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The work done in moving a charge of 10 µC between two diagonally opposite points on the square will be zero because these two points will be at equipotential.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 2.
           <br/>
           What is the electrostatic potential due to an electric dipole at an equatorial point? (All India 2009)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Electric potential at any point in the equatorial plane of dipole is Zero.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 3.
           <br/>
           What is the work done in moving a test charge q through a distance of 1 cm along the equatorial axis of an electric dipole? (All India 2009)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Since potential for equatorial axis
           <br/>
           V = 0
           <br/>
           ∴ W = qV = 0

           Define the term ‘potential energy’ of charge ‘q’ at a distance V in an external electric field. (All India 2009)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           It is defined as the amount of work done in bringing the charge from infinity to its position in the system in the electric field of another charge without acceleration.
           <br/>
           V = Er.
          </p>

<br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Clearly,
           <br/>
<img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 2 Electrostatic Potential and Capacitance Class 12 Important Questions 1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-116740" height="93" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-2-Electrostatic-Potential-and-Capacitance-Class-12-Important-Questions-1.png" width="276"/>

           Question 6.
           <br/>
           A hollow metal sphere of radius 5 cm is charged such that the potential on its surface is 10 V. What is the potential at the centre of the sphere?
           <br/>
           (All India 2011)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The electric field inside the shell is zero. This implies that potential is constant inside the shell (as no work is done in moving a charge inside the shell) and, therefore, equals its value at the surface, which is 10 V.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           Question 7.
           <br/>
           A hollow metal sphere of radius 10 cm is charged such that the potential on its surface is 5 V. What is the potential at the centre of the sphere? (All India 2011)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Hollow metal sphere behaves as an equipotential surface, so the potential at its centre will be 5 V.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 8.
           <br/>
           Why is electrostatic potential constant throughout the volume of the conductor and has the same value (as inside) on its surface? (Delhi 2012)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Electric field inside the conductor = 0

<p>
           Question 10.
           <br/>
           Why must the electrostatic potential inside a hollow charged conductor be the same at every point? (Comptt. All India 2012)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Inside the hollow charged conductor, electric field is zero therefore no work is done in moving a small test charge within the conductor. Hence electrostatic potential inside a hollow charged conductor is same at every point.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 11.
           <br/>
           What is the geometrical shape of equipotential surfaces due to a single isolated charge? (Delhi 2013)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Concentric spheres with a gap between them not being uniform as V \(\propto \frac{1}{r}\)
          </p>
<p>
           Question 12.
           <br/>
           Two charges 2µC and – 2µC are placed at points A and B 5 cm apart. Depict an equipotential surface of the system. (Comptt. Delhi 2013)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
<img alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 2 Electrostatic Potential and Capacitance Class 12 Important Questions 3" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-116742" height="121" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-2-Electrostatic-Potential-and-Capacitance-Class-12-Important-Questions-3.png" width="268"/>

<p>
           Question 13.
           <br/>
           What is the amount of work done in moving a point charge around a circular arc of radius r at the centre of which another point charge is located? (Comptt. All India 2013)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Being an equipotential surface, work done will be zero.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 14.
           <br/>
           Two charges 4µC and -4µC are placed at points A and B 3 cm apart. Depict an equipotential surface of the system. (Comptt. All India 2013)

           Question 15.
           <br/>
           “For any charge configuration, equipotential surface through a point is normal to the electric field.” Justify. (Delhi 2014)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Work done in moving a charge over an equipotential surface is zero, hence a point on it will be normal to the electric field.
           <br/>
           W = FS cos θ ∴ cos θ = 0 or θ = 90o

           Question 25.
           <br/>
           (i) Can two equipotential surfaces intersect each other? Give reasons.
           <br/>
           (ii) Two charges -q and + q are located at points A (0, 0, – a) and B (0, 0, +a) respectively. How much work is done in moving a test charge from point P (7, 0, 0) to Q (-3,0,0)? (Delhi 2009)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) No, if they intersect, there will be two different directions of electric field at that point which is not correct. If they intersect, then at the same point of intersection, there will be two values of potential. This is not possible and hence two equipotential surfaces cannot intersect.
           <br/>
           (ii) Since both the points P and Q are on the equatorial line of the dipole and V = 0 at every point on it, work done will be zero. Also the force on any charge is perpendicular to the equatorial line, so work done is zero.

           Two important conclusions :
           <br/>
           (i) Electric field is in the direction in which the potential decreases steepest.
           <br/>
           (ii) Magnitude of electric field is given by the change in the magnitude of potential per unit displacement, normal to the equipotential surface at the point.

           Question 46.
           <br/>
           Why does current in a steady state not flow in a capacitor connected across a battery? However momentary current does flow during charging or discharging of the capacitor. Explain. (All India 2017)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           In the steady state, the displacement current and hence the conduction current, is zero as | \(|\overrightarrow{\mathrm{E}}|\) | between the plates, is constant.
          </p>
<p>
           During charging and discharging, the displacement current and hence the conduction current is non zero as | \(|\overrightarrow{\mathrm{E}}|\) | between the plates, is changing with time.
          </p>
<p>
           Current is non zero as | \(|\overrightarrow{\mathrm{E}}|\) | between the plates, is changing with time.

           (iii) What is the ratio of electrostatic energy stored in X and Y? (Delhi)
           <br/>
           Answer:

           Question 51.

           (a) A charge +Q is placed on a large spherical conducting shell of radius R. Another small conducting sphere of radius r carrying charge ‘q’ is introduced inside the large shell and is placed at its centre. Find the potential difference between two points, one lying on the sphere and the other on the shell.
           <br/>
           (b) How would the charge between the two flow if they are connected by a conducting wire? Name the device which works on this fact. (All India 2009)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Potential inside conducting spherical shell of radius R carrying charge,
           <br/>
           q = constant = \(\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{Q}{R}\)

           Question 54.
           <br/>
           A parallel plate capacitor, each with plate area A. and separation d, is charged to a potential difference V. The battery used to charge it remains connected. A dielectric slab of thickness d and dielectric constant k is now placed between the plates. What change, if any, will take place in :
           <br/>
           (i) charge on plates?
           <br/>
           (ii) electric field intensity between the plates?
           <br/>
           (iii) capacitance of the capacitor?
           <br/>
           Justify your answer in each case. (Delhi 2010)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Given : Plate area of either plate of parallel plate capacitor = A
           <br/>
           Distance between the plates = d and
           <br/>
           potential difference between the plates = V
           <br/>
           ∴ Initially capacitance, C = \(\frac{\varepsilon_{0} A}{d}\),
           <br/>
           Charge on plate, Q = CV
           <br/>
           As the battery remains connected throughout, the potential difference between the plates remains unchanged (V’ = V) on placing, a dielectric slab of thickness ‘d’ and dielectric constant ‘k’ between the plates.
           <br/>
           (i) New charge on plates, Q’ = C’ V’ = kCV = kQ
           <br/>
           Thus, charge changes to k times of its original value.
           <br/>
           (ii) Electric field intensity between the plates, E’
           <br/>

           Question 62.
           <br/>
           A capacitor of unknown capacitance is connected across a battery of V volts. The charge stored in it is 300 µC. When potential across the capacitor is reduced by 100 V, the charge stored in it becomes 100 V. Calculate the potential V and the unknown capacitance. What will be the charge stored in the capacitor if the voltage applied had increased by 100 V? (Delhi 2013)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           (i) Charge stored, Q = CV
           <br/>
           300 µC = C × V ,
           <br/>
           When potential is reduced by 100 V
           <br/>
           100 µC = C(V – 100) = CV – 100 C
           <br/>
           100 µC = 300 µC – 100 C
           <br/>
           ⇒ 100 C = 300 µC – 100 µC
           <br/>
           ⇒ 100 C = 200 µC
           <br/>
           Therefore, capacitance C = 2µF

           (a) Potential at a point due to an electric dipole : Let us consider an electric dipole consisting of two equal and opposite charges -q at A and +q at B, separated by a distance 21 with centre at O. We have to calculate potential at a point P, whose polar co-ordinates are (r, 0); i.e. OP = r and ∠BOP = θ, as shown in the figure.
           <br/>
           Here AP = r
           <sub>

           , and BP = r
           <sub>
            2

           , we can easily calculate potential as P due to point charges at A and B using V = \(\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q}{r}\).

           To put this result in a more convenient form, we draw normals from A and B on the line joining O and P. From ∆BOD, we note that OD = l cos θ and from ∆OAC we note that OC = l cos θ. For a small dipole (AB &lt;&lt; OP), from the figure, we can take PB = PD and PA = PC.

           This result shows that unlike the potential due to a point charge, the potential due to a dipole is inversely proportional to the square r of the distance.

           Explanation: In the presence of electric field, the free charge carriers in a conductor move the charge distribution and the conductor readjusts itself so that the net Electric field within the conductor becomes zero.
          </p>
<p>
           In a dielectric, the external electric field induces a net dipole moment, by stretching / reorienting the molecules. The electric field, due to this induced dipole moment, opposes, but does not exactly cancel the external electric field.
          </p>
<p>
           Polarisation: Induced Dipole moment, per unit volume, is called the polarisation. For Linear isotropic dielectrics having a susceptibility x

           (b)
           <br/>
           Capacity of a parallel plate capacitor. A parallel plate capacitor consists of two large plane parallel conducting plates separated by a small distance. We first take the intervening medium between the plates to be vaccum. Let A be the area of each plate and d the separation between them. The two plates have charges Q and – Q. Since d is much smaller than the linear dimension of the plates (d
