           Question 1.
           <br/>
           Read the passage given below.
           <br/>
           The choices we make on a daily basis— wearing a seatbelt, lifting heavy objects correctly or purposely staying out of any dangerous situation—can either ensure our safety or bring about potentially harmful circumstances.
          </p>
<p>
           You and I need to make a decision that we are going to get our lives in order. Exercising
           <br/>
           5. self-control, self-discipline and establishing boundaries and borders in our lives are some of the most important things we can do. A life without discipline is one that’s filled with carelessness.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           We can think it’s kind of exciting to live life on the edge. We like the image of “Yeah! That’s me! Living on the edge! Woo-hoo!” It’s become a popular way to look at life. But if you see, even highways have lines, which provide margins for our safety while we’re driving. If we go
          </p>
<p>
           10. over one side, we’ll go into the ditch. If we cross over the line in the middle, we could get killed. And we tike those tines because they help to keep us safe. Sometimes we don’t even realize how lines help to keep us safe.
           <br/>
           I’m not proud of this, but for the first 20 years of my life at work, l ignored my limits. I felt horrible, physically, most of the time. I used to tell myself “I know I have limits and that I’ve 15. reached them, but I’m going to ignore them and see if or how long I can get by with it.” I ran to doctors, trying to make myself feel better through pills, vitamins, natural stuff and anything I could get my hands on. Some of the doctors would tell me, “It’s just stress.” That just made me mad. I thought stress meant you don’t tike what you do or can’t handle life, and I love what I do. But I kept pushing myself travelling, doing speaking engagements and so 20. on— simply exhausting myself.
          </p>
<p>
           Finally, I understood I was living an unsustainable life and needed to make some changes in my outlook and lifestyle.
           <br/>
           On the basis of your understanding of the passage, answer ANY FIVE questions from the six given below. (1 × 5)
           <br/>
           (A) What does the writer mean by saying to get our lives in order’? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           By the given phrase, the writer means that we should organize our life properly in such a way that it doesn’t pose any danger, risk or threat to us. We should get our life organized well.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           (B) Rewrite the following sentence by replacing the underlined phrase with a word that means the same from lines 15-20.
           <br/>
           The Government will possibly in the near future enforce a lockdown again considering the number of patients of virus in the nation. (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The Government will potentially enforce a lockdown again considering the number of patients of virus in the nation.
          </p>
<p>
           (C) State the meaning of ‘an unsustainable life as implied in the passage. (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           If something is ‘unsustainable’, we cannot prolong it or continue with it as it is harmful for us. In the passage, the writer wanted to conclude that with an unsustainable lifestyle, as it was, he could not continue with it. He wanted to have a better lifestyle.
          </p>
<p>
           (D) How has the writer used colloquial language in this write-up? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The writer has used colloquial language in this write-up by using the words like “yeah” and “Woohoo!”
          </p>
<p>
           (E) List two reasons as to the writer wanted to come up with this write-up. (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The writer wants us to stay out of danger by being meticulous for the choices that we make on a daily basis. He also wants us to stay out of danger and organize our lives properly in order to remain safe.
          </p>
<p>
           (F) How does the writer justify the high-ways’ lines as a ‘measure of safety’? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The writer justifies the highways’ lines as a ‘measure of safety’ by saying that the highway lines provide margins for our safety, while we are driving. They are meant to keep the drivers safe.
          </p>

           Question 2.
           <br/>
           Read the following excerpt from a case study titled ‘Marie Curie’.
           <br/>
           Marie was bom in 1867 in Warsaw, Poland, where her father was a Professor of Physics. At an early age, she displayed a brilliant mind and a blithe personality. Her great exuberance for learning, prompted her to continue with her studies after high school. She became disgruntled, however, when she
           <br/>
           5. learned that the University of Warsaw was closed to women. Determined to receive a higher education, she defiantly left Poland and in 1891, entered the Sorbonne, a French university, where she earned her master’s degree and doctorate in physics.
           <br/>
<img alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 10 English Term 2 Set 5 with Solutions 1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-133144" height="689" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-English-Term-2-Set-5-with-Solutions-1.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-English-Term-2-Set-5-with-Solutions-1.png 324w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CBSE-Sample-Papers-for-Class-10-English-Term-2-Set-5-with-Solutions-1-141x300.png 141w" width="324"/>
<br/>
           Marie was fortunate to have studied at the Sorbonne with some of the greatest scientists of her days, one of whom was Pierre Curie. 10. Marie and Pierre were married in 1895 and spent many productive years working together in the physics laboratory.
           <br/>
           A short time after they discovered radium, Pierre was killed by a horse-drawn wagon in 1906. Marie was stunned by this horrible misfortune and endured heartbreaking anguish. Despondently she recalled their close relationship and the joy that they had shared in scientific research. The fact that she had two young daughters to raise by herself greatly increased her distress.
          </p>
<p>
           15. Curie’s feeling of desolation finally began to fade when she was asked to succeed her husband as a physics professor at the Sorbonne. She was the first woman to be given a professorship at the world famous university. In 1911, she received the Nobel Prize in chemistry for isolating radium. Although Marie Curie eventually suffered a fatal illness from her long exposure to radium, she never became disillusioned about her work.
           <br/>
           20. Regardless of the consequences, she had dedicated herself to science and to revealing the mysteries of the physical world.
           <br/>
           On the basis of your understanding of the passage, answer ANY FIVE questions from the six given below. (1 × 5)
           <br/>
           (A) Why does the writer mean by saying that the University of Warsaw was ‘closed to women’? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           By saying that the University of Warsaw was ‘closed to women’, the writer wanted to tell that the university didn’t accept admission of any female candidate. It was not open for women.
          </p>
<p>
           (B) Comment on the significance of ‘professorship’ provided to Marie as given in the lines 14-17. (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           When the physics professorship was given to Marie, she became the first-ever woman to be given a professorship at the world famous university. The offer also significantly removed her feeling of desolation.
          </p>
<p>
           (C) Justify the Marie’s dedication towards her work from the lines 18-20. (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Marie was extremely dedicated towards her work. Despite her life-threatening ailment due to radium exposure, she dedicated herself to the research.
          </p>
<p>
           (D) How can you say that Marie was ‘determined’ for her higher studies? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Marie was ‘determined’ for her higher studies as she did not resist the denial of her admission into the University of Warsaw. Instead, she left Poland and applied to a French University of her master’s degree and doctorate in physics.
          </p>
<p>
           (E) Curie’s mother died of ‘grief’. How does evidence from table support this statement? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           From the table, we can see that in the year 1876, Marie’s sisters Bronya and Zosia became ill and Zosia passed away in ailment. Subsequently, in the year 1878, Marie’s mother died of the grief which aroused from her daughter’s death.
          </p>
<p>
           (F) What is the purpose of giving the ‘Year’ tab in the table for Marie? (1)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The ‘Year’ tab provides a timeline of Marie’s historical life.

           With a surge of products in the market, people are always in search of something unique and useful to buy. Nothing serves better than a good rummage through the Google search results or getting a friend’s advice, when it comes to clear our buying fix. A new statistical survey by the Global Consumer shows that 40 per cent of people say by they generally happen to know about the latest via a search engine ITEMS. At the same time, 40 per cent states rely upon friends and acquaintances for an advice or inspiration.

           Answer ANY TWO of the following in about 120 words each. (4 × 2)
           <br/>
           (A) India is a land that has wonderful natural beauty in its different parts. Examine the natural beauty found in Coorg and Assam, based on your reading of the chapter‘Glimpses of India.’ (4)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           The natural beauty of both Coorg and Assam is vast and amazing. Both of these places are rich in greenery and have unique traditional cultures. The chief crop in both the places is a beverage popular for its taste and flavour. Coorg gives us the most fragrant coffee while Assam gives us the best quality tea in the world. One gets the similar kind of visual delight on visiting these places.

           (C) “No legacy is so rich as honesty.” (William Shakespeare) Matilda lost her friend’s necklace and ruined her life in the process. Evaluate the given quote in the context of the lesson, ‘The Necklace’. How do you think the lesson reflects the importance of honesty? (4)
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Honesty is an important trait to possess. The story, The Necklace’ exemplifies this idea. I think that Matilda could have led a peaceful life had she controlled her social ambition, to borrow the necklace that she could ill-affbrd.
          </p>
<p>
           Matilda distressed herself with her unfulfilled desires to be accepted among the higher class. She was filled with wild joy at the party where she could show off her diamond necklace, borrowed from her rich friend, Mme. Forestier. After losing the necklace, she is once again unhappy, suggesting that material possessions cannot guarantee long-lasting happiness, and that greed can lead to ruin.
          </p>
<p>
           Had Matilda not been greedy and accepted the truth, she could have worked hard for making her own standard of living better which she always desired for. She became greedy and had to be dishonest to Mme Forestier about the necklace, which eventually ruined her entire life.
