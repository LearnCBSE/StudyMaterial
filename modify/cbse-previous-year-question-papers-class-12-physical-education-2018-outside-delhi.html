           Types of disability are :
           <br/>
           (i) Cognitive disability : Cognitive disability generally refers to anyone with lower than average intellectual functioning. A person who has a cognitive disability has trouble in performing mental tasks that the average person would be able to do.

           Question 15.
           <br/>
           What are the major muscles involved in run-ning, jumping and throwing ? Explain. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Gluteeus, quads, calves and hamstring are the major muscles involved while running. Glutes muscles stabilize the hips and legs. Quads propel you forward and help straighten out the leg in front so that it can make a good contact with the surface of ground. Calves muscles provide spring action in the steps and also act as shock absorber. While moving forward, hamstring help in pulling the leg back behind.
          </p>
<p>
           The leg, feet and gluteus muscle groups are used in jumping. Specific muscles which are involved in jumping are gluteus maximus, hamstrings, quadriceps and soleus.
          </p>
<p>
           In throwing, major muscles are pectorials major, lattissimus dorsi, anterior deltoid and teres major are involved. These muscles are comparatively responsible for velocity during the throw.
          </p>
<p>
           Question 16.
           <br/>

           What do you understand by ‘First Aid’ ? Discuss briefly about the aims and objectives of First Aid. [3]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           First Aid : It is the immediate care given to an injured or ill person. It does not take the place of proper medical treatment. It is a temporary assistance before actual medical care is obtained.
          </p>
<p>
           Aims &amp; Objectives : The most obvious objective of first aid is to save one’s life before the victim gets actual medical help. The objective can be simplified into the five Ps :

<li>
            Preserve life.
           </li>
<li>

            Procure medical aid.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           If a life-threatening situation does exist, the first aider should have knowledge of procedures to keep the casualty alive. A casuality should be isolated from all further dangers and placed in a position where their injury or illness will not become worse. The casualty’s injuries or illness should be attended to in order to prevent complications arising from his or her injury or illness.

           Question 22.
           <br/>
           Describe exercise guidelines at different stages of growth in children. Give suitable examples for every stage. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Excerise guidelines at different stages of growth: Development is a never ending process whereas growth refers to an increase caused by physiological change in which the child becomes bigger in size and heavier in weight. As every individual is unique in himself, individual differences and specificity of activity should be considered.
          </p>
<p>
           (i) Infant activity (0 to 2 yrs.) : In this stage, the growth pattern involves control over big muscles. Clean, safe and hygienic environment is the need in this stage. In this tender age, the activities have to be done under the observation of parents and guardians. Main exercises for this tender age are practice of balancing, walking and hearing from different directions.
          </p>
<p>
           (ii) Early childhood activity (3 to 8 yrs) : During this stage of growth, the pattern involves control over small muscles and bone development. The environment needed at this stage should be clean and safe, moreover proper checks by parents and teachers are required. Suggested sports- Running, throwing etc. Parents should keep a check that he or she does not fall on ground to avoid injuries.
          </p>
<p>
           (iii) Later childhood activities (8 to 12 yrs): During this stage, flexibility and co-ordinated activity of growth occurs. During this stage of growth, good quality apparatus and safety measures should be considered. Wrong hab-its should be checked. Suggested exercise and sports—100 metres races, hanging from horizontal bars, Cricket, Football, Tennis, Judo, Karate etc.

           <br/>
           What are the long term effects of regular exercise on the cardio-vascular system ? Explain. [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Effect of exercise on the cardio-vascular system:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Cardiac output increases : The cardiac output tends to increase as a result of regular exercise.
           </li>
<li>
            Resting heart rate decreases : The resting heart rate decreases due to regular exercise. After a duration of 10 week training programme, the resting rate may reduce upto 10 beats/min from the normal 72 beats/min.
           </li>
<li>
            Stroke volume increases at resting condition : The stroke volume at rest remains up to 50-70 ml/beat in untrained individuals, but in trained individuals it ranges from 70-90 ml/beat.
           </li>
<li>
            Blood volume increases : The blood volume increases due to regular exercises. Actually, as the blood volume increases, there is an increase in plasma volume. Also, the body produces a greater number of red blood cells.
           </li>
<li>
            Blood flow increases : The body increases its number of capillaries to the requirement of supplying more oxygen during exercise to the muscles. The existing capillaries open wider as well.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           Question 25.

           What is circuit training ? Draw a diagram of 10 stations to improve general fitness. How can load be increased in circuit training ? [5]
           <br/>
           Answer:
           <br/>
           Circuit training is a formal type of training in which an athlete goes through a series of selected exercises that are arranged in a circuit with 5 to 10 stations. In circuit training, several exercises are done one after the another. Completion of one set of each exercise in rotation is called one round. It was designed by GT Anderson and RE Morgan in 1953. It is very effective method for strength, speed and endurance development.
