             Question-6
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Compare the drainage system in your locality with that of the cities mentioned in the lesson. What similarities and differences do you notice?
           <br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
<span style="color: #ff0000;">
             Answer:
            </span>
</strong>
<br/>
           In our locality, the drainage system includes pipes and drains.
           <br/>
           In the lesson, it is mentioned that irrigation projects/things that were built during the time (which we have studied in the chapter) include ring wells and drains.

            Nowadays, everything (project or work) is well- maintained and made up of good raw materials. But in early cities mud bricks and thatch had been used which might not have been survived long. We use separator and filters with modem technology which was not there earlier.

<strong>
            Craftspersons at Work:
           </strong>
<br/>
           (a) Different crafts persons work in villages and cities. For example, blacksmiths, goldsmiths, carpenters, potters, weavers, etc.
          </p>
<p>
           (b) Craftsmen get the raw material from villages, nearby cities, and even import from far regions of India as well as from other countries.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<p>
           (c) Crafts persons use different types of equipment, as required for their crafts. For example, a potter uses potter’s wheel, spade, a stick, a spin-thread, a bright-fire burning or furnace, heating, and beating metal rods.
           <br/>
           A blacksmith uses iron and other metals, a furnace, a hammer, a big-iron rod, etc. A weaver uses a spinning wheel, cotton, needle, scissors, dye-colors, dying-vessels, etc.
           <br/>
           A carpenter uses wood, iron, a hand-ax, borer, iron-blade, nails.
          </p>
<p>
           (d) How do/did they work?
           <br/>
           Most of the craftsmen worked at their own cottage or home. Other family members used to help him. Many craftspersons formed associations known as Shrenis. Shrenis of crafts persons provided training, procured raw material, and distributed the finished product.
          </p>
<p>
           (e) What happened to the finished products?
           <br/>
           After keeping a small part by the craftspersons for their own or their family’s use, they took the remaining part of production (or surplus production) to local markets or neighbour-merchants. These merchants or traders used to take the products to those parts of the country or to other countries where they were demanded by the people or foreign traders or nationals.

<span style="color: #ff0000;">
             Answer:
            </span>
</strong>
<br/>
           In our city (or in our village) different types of functions such as domestic, officials, related with government posts or departments are performed by men and women as their daily routine.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            Mathura.
           </strong>
           It was (and even today) an important religious city about 2500 years ago. It was also important because this city was located at the two main trade and travel routes. The city is known for several temples and shrines. Farmers and herders from adjoining areas provided food items etc. to the citizens who lived in the city.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            Similar.
           </strong>
           In our city or village, people work as traders or merchants or farmers, as the men of the old city of Mathura performed. The women did a lot of work at home as the domestic wives or ladies perform in modem cities and villages.
          </p>
<p>
<strong>
            Differences.
           </strong>
           People in Mathura did work for the kings and their family-members but now in cities or villages people do work to meet their daily needs or expenses.

<strong>
             Question-1
            </strong>
</span>
<br/>
           Describe several ways of finding out about early cities. [V. Imp.]
           <br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
<span style="color: #ff0000;">
             Answer:
            </span>
</strong>
<br/>
           Several ways of finding out about early cities include Jatakas, sculpture, archaeology and travellers. Jatakas were stories composed by ordinary people and preserved by Buddhist monks. Sculptures carved scenes depicting peoples’ lives in towns and villages as well as in the forest. Many of these sculptures were used to decorate railings, pillars and gateways of buildings that were visited by people.
          </p>
<p>
           In many cities, archaeologists have found rows of pots or ceramic rings arranged one on top of the other. These are known as ring wells, which were used as toilets and as drains and garbage dumps. These ring wells are usually found in individual houses. The accounts of sailors and travellers also help us to know about early cities. One of the most detailed accounts that has been found was by an unknown Greek Sailor. He described all the ports he visited.
