            Question.3. What will be the amount of energy available to the organisms of the 2nd trophic level of a food chain, if the energy available at the first trophic level is 10,000 joules?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           According to 10% law, only 10% of energy entering a particular trophic level of organisms is available for transfer to the next higher trophic level.
           <br/>
           If energy in the 1st trophic level is 10000 J.
           <br/>
           Then, energy in 2nd trophic level = 10% of 10000 J = 10/100 x 10000 J = 1000 Joules

            Question.6. What is biodiversity? What will happen if biodiversity of an area is not preserved? Mention one effect of it.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Biodiversity is the diversity of life in an area. It is the number and range of variety of species of life forms in an area.
           <br/>
           The loss of biodiversity of an area will lead to the loss of ecological stability of the eco- system. It can result in environment disasters such as floods, forest fires, etc.

<strong>
            Question.7. List two tests for experimentally distinguishing between an alcohol and a carboxylic acid and describe how these tests are performed.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Test-1—Litmus Test. Take 2 strips of blue litmus paper. Place a drop each of alcohol and carboxylic acid on these strips separately. The blue litmus paper turns red in the case of carboxylic acid and remains unaffected in the case of alcohol.
           <br/>
           Test-2—Sodium hydrogen carbonate Test /Sodium carbonate Test. A pinch of sodium hydrogen carbonate or sodium carbonate is added to both alcohol and a carboxylic acid separately. If brisk effervescence with the evolution of a colourless gas is observed, it ! indicates the presence of carboxylic acid whereas no effervescence is seen in case of an alcohol.

<strong>
            Question 8. Draw the electron-dot structure for ethyne. A mixture of ethyne and oxygen is burnt for welding. In your opinion, why cannot we use a mixture of ethyne and air for this purpose?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           In pure oxygen, ethyne undergoes complete combustion and high temperature suitable for welding is attained. Whereas air contains less percentage/amount of oxygen which results in incomplete combustion of ethyne and the temperature required for the welding is not attained. Hence we cannot use a mixture of ethyne and air for this purpose.

            Question.10. Taking the example of an element of atomic number 16, explain how the electronic configuration of the atom of an element relates to its position in the modern periodic table and how valency of an element is calculated on the basis of its atomic number.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Atomic number of the element = 16 Electronic configuration = K L M = 2, 8, 6
           <br/>
           Since this element has 3 shells, the period number will be 3 as period number is equal to the number of shells that start filling up in it.
           <br/>
           No. of valence electrons = 6
           <br/>
           The group number will be 10 + 6 = 16
           <br/>
           The valency of an element is determined by the number of valence electrons present in the outermost shell.
           <br/>
           Valency of the element will be = 8 – valence electrons = 8-6 = 2

            Question.11. List six specific characteristics of sexual reproduction.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Characteristics of sexual reproduction are:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            In sexual reproduction, two parents are involved (male and female).
           </li>
<li>
            The new organism produced is genetically different from both parents.
           </li>
<li>
            During gamete formation meiosis occurs. After fertilisation all divisions are mitotic.
           </li>
<li>
            Sexual reproduction helps in evolution.
           </li>
<li>
            Fertilisation of gametes leads to zygote formation. This zygote grows and develops to form a new organism.
           </li>
<li>
            Humans, fish, dogs, hens, cats, cows, horses, deer, rabbit, lions and tigers all reproduce by the method of sexual reproduction. Most of the flowering plants also reproduce by sexual reproduction.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
            Question.12. What are chromosomes? Explain how in sexually reproducing organisms the number of chromosomes in the progeny is maintained.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Chromosomes are thread-like structures made up of DNA and proteins. They are found in the nucleus at the time of cell division.
           <br/>
           During gamete formation meiosis occurs and the original number of chromosomes becomes half. Hence, when two gametes combine the zygote formed contains the full set of chromosomes and the original number of chromosomes gets restored in the progeny.

<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
<strong>
            The significance of reproductive health of society are:
           </strong>
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<ol>
<li>
            Regular medication and check-ups have led to development of reproductive health.Healthy mothers give birth to healthy children.
           </li>
<li>
            Reproductive health should be maintained in order to prevent sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).
           </li>
<li>
            Family planning by using various contraceptives enables a couple to decide on the number of children they want to have and when to have them. If a couple has less number of children they can provide good food, clothes and education to each child. So a small family is a happy family.
           </li>
<li>
            Having fewer children also keeps the mother in good health. This will reduce the cases of maternal mortality as well as new born mortality.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
            Areas which have improved:
           </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
            Better family planning has led to reduction in family size and better economic stability.
           </li>
<li>
            Decrease in STD cases due to more awareness and wider use of contraceptives.

<strong>
            Uses:
           </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
            Convex mirrors are used as rear-view mirrors in vehicles to see the traffic at the rear side (or back side) because —(i) a convex mirror always produces an erect image of the object; (ii) the image formed in a convex mirror is highly diminished due to which a convex mirror gives a wide field of view.
           </li>
<li>
            Big convex mirrors are used as ‘shop security mirrors’. By installing a big convex mirror at a strategic point in the shop, the shop owner can keep an eye on the customer to look for thieves and shoplifters among them as convex mirrors always form a virtual, diminished and erect image.

<strong>
            Question.17. What is meant by scattering of light? Use this phenomenon to explain why the clear sky appears blue or the sun appears reddish at sunrise.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Scattering of light is the phenomenon to throw light in various random directions. Light is scattered when it falls on various types of suspended particles in its path. The colour of the scattered light depends on the size of the scattering particles in the atmosphere.
           <br/>
           — The larger particles of dust and water droplets present in the atmosphere scatter the light of longer wavelengths due to which the scattered light appears white.
           <br/>
           — The extremely minute particles such as air molecules present in the atmosphere scatter mainly blue light present in the white sunlight.
           <br/>
           Colour of the sky appears blue. The molecules of air and other fine particles in the atmosphere have a size smaller than the wavelength of visible light. So these particles scatter more effectively the light rays of shorter wavelength at the blue end than light of longer wavelength at the red end. When the scattered blue light enters our eyes, it gives us the feeling of a blue sky.
           <br/>
           Colour of the sun appears red at sunrise and sunset. The sun at sunrise and sunset is very near to the horizon, and near the horizon most of the blue light of shorter wave-lengths is scattered away by the particles in the atmosphere. Therefore, the light that reaches our eyes is of longer wavelengths that gives rise to the reddish appearance of the sun.

<strong>
            Explain how the embryo gets nourishment inside the mother’s -body.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           (a) Testis produces sperms and secretes male hormone—testosterone.
           <br/>
           Function of testosterone hormone is to control the development of male sex organs and male features such as deeper voice, moustaches, body hair, etc. All these changes caused by testosterone are associated with male puberty which the boys attains at an age of 13 to 14 years. It also controls the formation of male gamete, i.e., sperm.
           <br/>
           (b) (i) Fertilisation takes place in fallopian tube (oviduct).
           <br/>
           (ii) Implantation of the fertilised egg occurs in the uterus.
           <br/>
           Nourishment of embryo. After fertilisation, zygote is formed which develops into an embryo. The embryo gets nutrition from the mother’s blood with the help of a special tissue called placenta. This is a disc which is embedded in the uterine wall. It contains villi on the embryo’s side of the tissue. On the mother’s side are blood spaces, which surround the villi. This provides a large surface area for glucose and oxygen to pass from the mother to the embryo. In this way, embryo gets its nutrition.

           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            (b) traits are inherited independently?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Mendel’s experiments show that the
           <br/>
           (a) Traits may be dominant or recessive. When Mendel cross-bred plants of two different traits of character, a tall pea plant (TT) and a dwarf pea plant (tt) to get a progeny ( F
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           generation), all F
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           plants were tall. Only the dominant trait was visible in this generation. But when plants of F
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           generation were self bred then the two traits of character got separated in the plants of F
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           generation. All plants obtained in the F
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           generation were not tall. One-fourth of the F
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           plants were short.
           <br/>
           Appearance of tall characters in both the F
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           and F
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           generations shows that it is a dominant character. Whereas the absence of dwarf character in F
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           generation and its reappearance in F
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           generation shows dwarfness is the recessive character.
           <br/>
           (b) Traits are inherited independently. Mendel cross-bred pea plants showing two different characteristics, rather than just one. When he cross-bred pea plants of round green seeds with wrinkled yellow seeds, he got F
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           generation with all such seeds which were Gametes yellow and round. So, it was concluded that round and yellow character of seeds were dominant traits in the pea plant. On selfing of F
           <sub>
            1
           </sub>
           progeny, different types of F
           <sub>
            2
           </sub>
           progeny were obtained.
           <br/>
           So traits of two different characters were inherited independent of each other and made new combination characteristics independent of their previous combinations.

<br/>
           The power of a concave lens is negative therefore, lens B is a concave lens.
           <br/>
           When an object is placed at 8 cm (i.e., between the optical centre and principal focus) only convex lens will form the virtual and magnified image.

<br/>
           Therefore, lens A will form a virtual and magnified image of the object placed 8 cm from it. When the object is placed between the optical centre and the focus: (i.e., between O and F) the image formed is behind the object (on the same side), virtual, erect and magnified.

            Question.24. Write the importance of ciliary muscles in the human eye. Name the defect of vision that arises due to gradual weakening of the ciliary muscles in old age. What type of lenses are required by the persons suffering from this defect to see the objects clearly? Akshay, sitting in the last row in his class, could not see clearly the words written on the blackboard. When the teacher noticed it, he announced if any student sitting in the front row could volunteer to exchange his seat with Akshay. Salman immediately agreed to exchange his seat with Akshay. He could now see the words written on the blackboard clearly. The teacher thought it fit to send the message to Akshay’s parents advising them to get his eyesight checked.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            In the context of the above event, answer the following questions:
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            (a) Which defect of vision is Akshay suffering from? Which type of lens is used to correct this defect?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            (b) State the values displayed by the teacher and Salman.

<br/>
<strong>
            (c) In your opinion, in what way can Akshay express his gratitude towards the teacher and Salman?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Importance of ciliary muscles. The focal length of eye lens can be changed by changing its shape by the action of ciliary muscles. Ciliary muscles modify the curvature of the eye lens to enable the eye to focus objects at varying distances.
           <br/>
           In old age, ciliary muscles become weak and the eye lens become inflexible. As a result, the eye loses its power of accommodation. Because of this, an old person cannot see the nearby objects clearly. This leads to the defect called presbyopia.
           <br/>
           Bifocal lenses are required by the persons suffering from presbyopia in which upper part consists of a concave lens for distant vision and the lower part consists of a convex lens used to see nearby objects.
           <br/>
           (a) Akshay is suffering from myopia or near sightedness. Myopia is corrected by using spectacles containing concave lenses. The concave lens used for correcting myopia should be of such a focal length that it produces a virtual image of the distant object (lying at infinity) at the far point of the myopic eye.
           <br/>
           (b) • The teacher is concerned about the health of the student.
           <br/>
           • Salman is very helpful and caring.
           <br/>

           </strong>
           The first trophic level in a food chain is always a green plant because green plants have a mechanism for trapping solar energy with the help of their green pigment called chlorophyll and convert it into chemical energy which is stored as carbohydrates in the plant for the use of the next tropic level.

<br/>
           (a) They all belong to 2nd group of the periodic table as all the elements have two valence electrons in their valence shell.
           <br/>
           (b) Be is least reactive as it contains the least number of shells (i.e., 2). The tendency of an atom to lose electrons on moving down in a group increases as valence electrons move more and more away from the nucleus and nuclear charge on valence electrons decreases.
           <br/>
           (c) Ca has the largest atomic size as it has the maximum number of shells.

            Question.18. What is an ecosystem? List its two main components. We do not clean natural ponds or lakes but an aquarium needs to be cleaned regularly. Why is it so? Explain.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           An ecosystem is a self-contained unit of living things (plants, animals and decomposers) and their non-living environment (soil, air and water). An ecosystem needs only the input of sunlight energy for its functioning.
           <br/>
           Ecosystem is made up of two main components:
           <br/>
           (i) Abiotic component meaning non-living component.
           <br/>
           (ii) Biotic component meaning living component.
           <br/>
           An aquarium is an artificial ecosystem. It needs to be cleaned regularly because it has – stagnant water and no decomposers. Therefore the dead parts and excrete of the organisms of the aquarium are not decomposed and would never be returned to their original pool. The accumulation of these wastes can be dangerous for the living organisms in the aquarium.

<strong>
            Question.5. Why is sustainable management of natural resources necessary? Out of the two reuse and recycle which, in your opinion, is better to practise? Give reason.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Sustainable management is management that encourages the judicious use of natural resources to meet the current basic human needs while preserving the resources for the needs of future generations.
           <br/>
           Reuse is a better practise than recycle as recyling requires a large amount of energy and money. In this strategy, we are encouraged to use things again and again instead of throwing them away with no expense of energy. Reuse also does not cause pollution. Example, plastic bottles of jams and pickles can be reused for storing things in the kitchen.

<img alt="cbse-previous-year-question-papers-class-10-science-sa2-outside-delhi-2015-25" height="178" loading="lazy" src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5762/30416157372_b7dfb04af1_o.png" width="841"/>
<br/>
           (a) D has 1 electron in the-outermost shell. Atomic no. = 19, Elec. Configuration = 2, 8, 8,1
           <br/>
           (b) A and E belong to the same group, i.e., 2nd group of the periodic table as both have same number of valence electrons (i.e., 2) in their outermost shell.
           <br/>
           (c) A &amp; B and D &amp;’E belong to the same period as they have the same no. of valence shells. A and B have 2 shells thus belong to 2nd period of the periodic table.
           <br/>
           D and E have 4 shells thus belong to 4th period of the periodic table.
           <br/>
           A has the bigger atomic radius among A and B and D has the bigger atomic radius among D and E as atomic size decreases on moving from left to right in a period (or atomic size decreases as the atomic number increases in a period).

            Question.12. List four categories of contraceptive methods. State in brief two advantages of adopting such preventive methods.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Three different methods of contraception. See Q. 12, 2014 (Delhi).
           <br/>
           Advantages of adopting such preventive methods:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Contraceptive methods are used to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis, AIDS, etc.
           </li>
<li>
            Contraceptives prevent unwanted and frequent pregnancies. If a couple has less number of children, they can provide good clothes, good food and a good education to each child. This will make the parents as well as children happy.
           </li>
</ol>
