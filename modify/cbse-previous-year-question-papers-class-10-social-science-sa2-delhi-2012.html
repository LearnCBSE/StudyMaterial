            Question.9. Why did Non-cooperation Movement gradually slow down in cities? Explain any three reasons.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           The Non-cooperation Movement gradually slowed down in cities for a variety of reasons:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Khadi cloth was more expensive than mill cloth and poor people could not afford to buy it. As a result they could not boycott mill cloth for too long.
           </li>
<li>
            Alternative Indian institutions were not there which could be used in place of the British ones. These were slow to come up.
           </li>
<li>
            So students and teachers began trickling back to government schools and lawyers joined back work in government courts.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
            Question.10. Describe the role of the peasants in Awadh in the Non-cooperation Movement.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Role of the peasants in Awadh in the Non-cooperation Movement:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            In Awadh, the peasants’ movement was led by Baba Ramchandra—a Sanyasi who had earlier worked in Fiji as indentured labour.
           </li>
<li>
            The movement was against taluqdars and landlords who demanded high rents from the peasants. Peasants had to do ‘begad and work at landlords’ farms without any payment. As tenants, they had no security of tenure and could be evicted without any notice.
           </li>
<li>
            The peasants’ movement demanded reduction of revenue, abolition of begar and social boycott of these landlords.
           </li>
<li>
            In many places Nai-Dhobi bandhs were organized to deprive landlords of the services of even washermen and barbers.
           </li>
<li>
            In 1920, Jawahar Lai Nehru began talking to the villagers and formed Oudh Kisan Sabha’. Within a month 300 branches had been setup in the villages.
           </li>
<li>
            As the movement spread in 1921, the houses of taluqdars and merchants were attacked, bazaars were looted and grain hoards were taken over.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
            Question.11. Describe the process of unification of Germany.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Unification of Germany:
           <br/>
           In the 18th century, Germany w’as divided into a number of states. Some of these states ceased to exist during the Napoleonic wars. At the end of the war, there were still 39 independent states in Germany. Prussia was most powerful, dominated by big landlords known as Junkers.
          </p>
<div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">
</div>
<ol>
<li>
            Nationalist feelings were widespread among middle class Germans who had tried to unite the different regions of the German federation into a nation-state governed by an elected Parliament.
           </li>
<li>
            In May 1848, a large number of political associations came together to vote for an All German National Assembly. Their representatives met at Frankfurt and the Frankfurt Assembly proposed the unification of Germany as a constitutional monarchy under the King of Prussia as emperor.
           </li>
<li>
            The King of Prussia rejected the offer and the liberal initiative of nation building was repressed by combined forces of the monarchy, the military and the ‘Junkers’.
           </li>
<li>
            Then on, Prussia under its Chief Minister Otto von Bismarck led the movement for unification of Germany. Bismarck carried out this process with the help of the Prussian army and the bureaucracy. He fought three wars over seven years with Denmark, Austria and France. Prussia was victorious in all these wars and the process of unification was completed as a result of Prussia’s victory over France.
           </li>
<li>
            Consequently, on 18th January 1871, an assembly comprising of princes of German states, representatives of the army, important Prussian ministers and Bismarck gathered in the Palace of Versailes and proclaimed the Prussian King, Kaiser William, the new German Emperor.
           </li>
</ol>

<strong>
            Describe infrastructural projects which were developed by the French colonisers in Vietnam.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Infrastructural projects which were developed by the French colonisers in Vietnam:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            The French built canals and drained lands in the Mekong Delta to increase cultivation. The irrigation canals helped to increase rice production and allowed the export of rice to the international market.
           </li>
<li>
            Transport networks were laid to help transport goods for trade and move military garrisons.
           </li>
<li>
            The French constructed trans-Indo-China rail network to connect the northern and the southern parts of Vietnam and Yunan in China.

           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer
           </strong>
           . The following reasons favoured the concentration of cotton textile industry in Maharashtra and Gujarat:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Availability of raw cotton from the nearby black soil region of Maharashtra and Gujarat.
           </li>
<li>
            Humid climatic conditions are suitable for spinning and weaving, else the yam snaps.
           </li>
<li>
            Well developed transport network and proximity to Mumbai (Bombay) port facilitated import of machineries and export of finished products, thereby led to the concentration of textile industry in Maharashtra and Gujarat.
           </li>
<li>
            India is a tropical country and cotton clothes are ideal and comfortable to wear. So there was a ready market within the country as well as outside India because of fine quality cloth produced here.

            Question.15. Explain the conditions in which democracies are able to accommodate social diversities.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           No society can fully and permanently resolve conflicts among different groups. But we can certainly learn to respect these differences and evolve a mechanism to negotiate the differences. Belgium is an example of how successfully differences were negotiated among ethnic groups. Therefore, democracy is best suited to accommodate various social divisions as it usually develops a procedure to conduct their competition. But the example of Sri Lanka shows how distrust between two communities turned into widespread conflict and thus a democracy must fulfill the following two conditions in order to achieve a harmonious social life:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Majority and minority opinions are not permanent. Democracy is not simply rule by majority opinion. The majority needs to work with the minority so that government may function to represent the general view.
           </li>
<li>
            Rule by majority does not become rule by majority community in terms of religion or race or linguistic groups, etc. Democracy remains democracy so long as every citizen has a chance of being in majority at some point of time. No individual should be debarred from participating in a democracy on the basis of religion, caste, community, creed and other such factors.

</ol>

            Question.16. Name the three challenges faced by a democracy. Explain ‘the challenge of deepening of democracy’ by stating three points.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Three challenges faced by a democracy:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Foundational challenge
           </li>
<li>
            Challenge of expansion
           </li>
<li>
            Challenge of deepening of democracy
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
           The challenge of deepening of democracy:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            This challenge involves strengthening of the institutions and practices of democracy. It means strengthening those institutions that help people’s participation and control in the government.
           </li>
<li>
            The challenge lies in realising the expectations of the people in a democracy. It is possible that some significant decisions may take place through consensus but challenging moments in democracy usually involve conflict between those groups who have power and those who aspire for a share in power. In Bolivia, the water struggle was a challenge of deepening of democracy.
           </li>
<li>
            The challenge of deepening of democracy is faced by every nation in one form or another. It aims at bringing down the control and influence of the rich and powerful people in making governmental decisions. The need is for individual freedom and dignity to have legal and moral force.
           </li>
</ol>

<strong>
            Question.17. How are some countries of the world facing the ‘challenge of expansion of democracy’?
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Explain with examples.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Most of the established democracies face the challenge of expansion. This involves . applying the basic principle of democratic government across all the regions, different social groups and various institutions.
           <br/>
           Ensuring greater power to local government, extension of federal principle to all the units of federation, inclusion of women and minority groups, etc. falls under this challenge. This means less and less decisions should remain outside the arena of democratic control. Most of the countries including India and the US face this challenge.

<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Some common ways by which consumers are exploited by manufacturers and traders are given below:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Underweight and under-measurement. Goods sold in the market are sometimes not measured or weighted correctly.
           </li>
<li>
            High prices. Often the traders charge a price higher than the prescribed retail price.
           </li>
<li>
            Sub-standard quality. The goods sold are sometimes of sub-standard quality, for example, selling medicines beyond their date of expiry, selling deficient or defective home appliances.
           </li>
<li>
            Adulteration and impurity. In costly edible items like oil, ghee and spices, adulteration is common in order to earn more profit. This causes heavy loss to the consumers. They suffer from monetary’ loss as well as damage to their health.
           </li>
<li>
            False and incomplete information. Sellers easily mislead consumers by giving wrong information about a product, its price, quality, reliability, life-cycle, expiry, date, durability, its effect on health, environment, safety and security, maintenance cost involved and terms and conditions of purchase. Cosmetics, drugs and electronic goods are common examples where consumers face such problems. (any three)

            Question.26. What is multi-party system? How has multi-party system strengthened democracy in India? Explain.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Multi-party system. In tkis system, the government is formed by various parties coming together in a coalition. When several parties in a multi-party system join hands for the purpose of contesting elections and winning power, it is called an alliance or a front.
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            This system appears messy and leads to political instability. But, at the same time, it allows for a variety’ of interests and opinions to enjoy political representation.
           </li>
<li>
            Each country develops a party system that is conditioned by its special circumstances. If India has evolved as a multi-party system, it is because its social and geographical diversity cannot be absorbed by two or three parties. Thus, such representation of social diversity strengthens democracy.
           </li>
<li>
            Multi-party7 system facilitates representation of regional and geographical diversities. In India, several regional parties are in power at the State level such as the DMK in Tamil Nadu, Akali Dal in Punjab and BSP in Uttar Pradesh.

<strong>
            Question.15. Describe the popular struggle ‘against privatization of water’ in Bolivia.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Bolivia, a poor country in Latin America, witnessed popular struggle against privatization of water:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            The World Bank had pressurised the elected democratic government to give up its control of municipal water supply. The government sold these rights for the city of Cochambamba to a multinational company (MNC).
           </li>
<li>
            The MNC immediately increased the price of water by four times. This led to a spontaneous popular protest. The mass struggle was not led by any political party.
           </li>
<li>
            A new alliance of labour human rights and community leaders organized a successful four-day general strike in the city in January 2000.
           </li>
<li>
            Ultimately the government agreed to negotiate and the strike was called off. But yet nothing happened.
           </li>
<li>
            Later on, an organization comprising local professionals, engineers, environmentalists, farmers, confederation of factory workers union, middle class students and street children formed the FEDECOR, They called another strike in April and the government imposed martial law.
           </li>
<li>
            But the power of the people forced the officials of the MNC to free the city and made the government concede to the demands of the protesters.
           </li>
<li>
            Lastly, the contract with the MNC was cancelled and water supply was restored to the municipality at old rates. This came to be known as ‘Bolivia’s Water War’.
           </li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
            Question.19. How does ‘Right to Safety’ help consumers? Explain with an example.
           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Safety is everyone’s right. There are many goods and services that we purchase require special attention to safety. The consumers have the right to be protected against the marketing of goods and deliver}’ of services that are hazardous to life and property. Producers need to strictly following required safety rules and regulation.
           <br/>
           For example: Pressure cookers have a safety valve which, if defective, can cause a serious accident. The manufacturers of the safety valve have to ensure high quality. We also need public or government action to see that this quality is maintained.
           <br/>
           LPG cylinder, cinema theatres, circus, medicines, edible oil, high risk buildings, etc. are . some of the products/ services that require proper Safety rules to be observed by the producer/service provider.

<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>

           </li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>

           </strong>
</p>
<ol>

           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           Sugar mills are shifting towards southern and western states, because:

<ol>
<li>
            Cane produced her£ has higher sucrose content.
           </li>
<li>
            The favourable climatic conditions (cooler climate) ensure a longer growing and crushing season.
           </li>
<li>
            The Cooperatives are more successful in these states and sugar industry being seasonal in nature, is ideally suited to cooperative sector.
           </li>

           </strong>
<br/>
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
           The passion of respect and freedom are the basis of democracy:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Economic disparity in society has been minimized to a great extent.
           </li>
<li>

           </li>
<li>
            Democracy in India has strengthened the claims of the disadvantaged and discriminated castes for equal states and opportunities, for example, SCs and STs.
           </li>
<li>
            In democracy all adult citizens have the right to vote.
           </li>
<li>
            Democracy evolves a mechanism that takes into account the differences and intrinsic attributes of various ethnic groups. In a democracy majority always needs to work taking into account the interest of the minority so that the minority do not feel alienated.
           </li>
