<p>
          Question 5.
          <br/>
          State the provisions of Indian Partnership Act, 1932 regarding interest on partners capital and interest on partners loan when there is no partnership deed.(All India 2015,2010)

<p>
          Question 6.
          <br/>
          The partnership deed is silent on payment of salary to partners. Anita, a partner, claimed that, since she managed the business, she should get a monthly salary of ?10,000. Is she entitled for the salary? Give reason. (Delhi (C) 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          No, Anita is not entitled for the salary. Since, the partnership deed is silent on the payment of salary to partners, in that case provisions of Partnership Act will be followed which prohibits payment of salary to the partners.

          Working Note:
          <br/>
          Interest on Aâ€™s Capital = 60,000 Ã— 12% = â‚¹ 7,200
          <br/>
          Interest on Bâ€™s Capital = 80,000 Ã— 12% = â‚¹ 9, 600
          <br/>
          ? 7,200 + â‚¹ 9, 600 = 16,800
          <br/>
          As interest on capital is more than profit available, i.e. â‚¹ 12,600
          <br/>
          So, interest on capital will be provided to the maximum of profit available.
          <br/>
          Hence,
          <br/>
          Interest on Aâ€™s Capital =12,600 Ã— \(\frac { 7,200 }{ 16,800 }\) = â‚¹ 5 400
          <br/>
          Interest on Bâ€™s Capital = 12,600 Ã— \(\frac { 9,600 }{ 16,800 }\) = â‚¹ 7 200

          Working Note
          <br/>
          Calculation of New Profit Sharing Ratio
          <br/>
          Rupeshâ€™s share = \(\frac { 1 }{ 4 }\)
          <br/>
          Mukeshâ€™s share = \(1-\frac{1}{4}=\frac{3}{4}\)
          <br/>
          Remaining share = \(\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{2}{3}=\frac{2}{4}\)
          <br/>
          Rameshâ€™s share = \(\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{1}{3}=\frac{1}{4}\)
          <br/>
          Distributable profits = â‚¹ 1,60,000 to be distributed between Mukesh, Ramesh and Rupesh in 2 : 1 : 1 ratio.
          <br/>
          Mukeshâ€™s share = 1,60,000 x \(\frac { 2 }{ 4 }\) = â‚¹ 80,000;
          <br/>
          Rameshâ€™s share = 1,60,000 x \(\frac { 1 }{ 4 }\) = â‚¹ 40,000;
          <br/>
          Rupeshâ€™s share = 1,60,000 x \(\frac { 1 }{ 4 }\) = â‚¹ 40,000;
          <br/>
          Rupeshâ€™s share is less than the guaranteed amount of â‚¹ 55,000, therefore deficiency of â‚¹ 15,000 (55,000 â€“ 40,000) shall be borne by Mukesh and Ramesh in 2:1 ratio, i.e. Mukesh will give
          <br/>
          = 15,000 x \(\frac { 1 }{ 3 }\) = â‚¹ 10,000 and Ramesh will give =15,000 x \(\frac { 1 }{ 3 }\) = â‚¹ 5,000.

          3. Calculation of Commission Payable to Bhola
          <br/>
          3,0, 000 x \(\frac { 10 }{ 100 }\) = â‚¹ 30,000
         </p>
<p>
          4. Distributable profits = 3,00,000 + 7,500 â€“ 85,000 â€“ 4,000 â€“ 30,000 = â‚¹ 1,88,500
          <br/>
          Moliâ€™s share =1,88,500 x \(\frac { 3 }{ 10 }\) = â‚¹ 56,550; Bholaâ€™s share = 1,88,500 x \(\frac { 3 }{ 10 }\) = â‚¹ 56,500
          <br/>
          Rajâ€™s share =1,88,500 x \(\frac { 4 }{ 10 }\) = â‚¹ 75,400; Amount guaranteed to Raj = â‚¹ 1,50,000
          <br/>
          Deficiency = Guaranteed amount â€“ Actual amount
          <br/>
          = 1,50,000 â€“ 75,400 = â‚¹ 74,600 to be borne by Moli and Bhola equally, i.e. 37,300 each.

<p>
          Interest on Drawings
          <br/>
          Eleen = 24,000 x \(\frac { 5 }{ 100 }\) x \(\frac { 6.5 }{ 12 }\) = â‚¹ 650

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Average Profit = â‚¹ 4,00,000
          <br/>
          Capital Employed = â‚¹ 6,00,000
          <br/>
          Normal Rate of Return = 8%
          <br/>
          Normal Profit = 6,00,000 x \(\frac { 8 }{ 100 }\) = â‚¹ 48,000 100
          <br/>
          Super Profit = Average Profit â€“ Normal Profit
          <br/>
          = 4,00,000 â€“ 48P00 = â‚¹ 3,52,000
          <br/>
          Goodwill = Super Profit Ã— \(\frac { 100 }{ Normal Rate of Return }\)
          <br/>
          = 3,52,000 Ã— \(\frac { 100 }{ 8 }\)

Calculate the goodwill of the firm. (Delhi 2019)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Capital Employed = â‚¹ 10,00,000
          <br/>
          Normal Rate of Return = 15%
          <br/>
          Normal Profit = 10,00,000 Ã— 15% = â‚¹ 1,50,000
          <br/>
          3 Yearâ€™s Average Profit
          <br/>
          = \(\frac { 3,00,000 + 3,60,000 + 4,20,000 }{ 3 }\)

          Question 76.
          <br/>
          On 1st April, 2014 a firm had assets of â‚¹ 1,00,000 excluding stock of â‚¹ 20,000. Partnersâ€™ capital accounts showed a balance of â‚¹ 60,000. The current liabilities were â‚¹ 10,000 and the balance constituted the reserve. If the normal rate of return is 8% the â€˜Goodwillâ€™ of the firm is valued at â‚¹ 60,000 at four yearsâ€™ purchase of super profit, find the average profit of the firm. (All India (C) 2015)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Goodwill = Super Profit Ã— Number of Yearsâ€™ Purchase
          <br/>
          60,000 = Super profit Ã— 4
          <br/>
          Super profit = \(\frac { 60,000 }{ 4 }\) = â‚¹ 15000
          <br/>
          Capital Employed
          <br/>
          â‡’ Total Assets â€“ Current liabilities
          <br/>
          â‡’ (100000 + 20000) â€“ 10000
          <br/>
          â‡’ â‚¹ 110000
          <br/>
          Normal Profit = Capital Employed Ã— Normal Rate of Return
          <br/>
          = 110000 x \(\frac { 8 }{ 100 }\) = â‚¹ 8,800
          <br/>
          Super Profit = Average Profit â€“ Normal Profit
          <br/>
          15000 = Average profit â€“ 8,800
          <br/>
          Average profit = 15,000 + 8,800 = â‚¹ 23000
         </p>

          Question 77.
          <br/>
          The average profit earned by a firm is â‚¹ 75,000 which includes undervaluation of stock of â‚¹ 5,000 on an average basis. The capital invested in the business is â‚¹ 7,00,000 and the normal rate of return is 7%. Calculate goodwill of the firm on the basis of 5 times the super profit. (Delhi (C) 2015)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Average profit = 75,000 + 5,000 = â‚¹ 80,000
          <br/>
          Normal Profit = Capital Employed Ã— Normal Rate of Return
          <br/>
          = 700000 Ã— \(\frac { 7 }{ 100 }\) = â‚¹ 49000
          <br/>
          Super Profit = Average Profit â€“ Normal Profit
          <br/>
          = 80000 â€“ 49000 = â‚¹ 31000
          <br/>
          Goodwill = Super Profit Ã— Number of Years Purchase
          <br/>
          = 31000 Ã— 5 = â‚¹ 1,55000

          Answer:
          <br/>
          Actual average profit = â‚¹ 1,00,000
          <br/>
          Normal rate of return = 10%
          <br/>
          Total assets = â‚¹ 10,00,000
          <br/>
          External liabilities = â‚¹ 1,80,000
          <br/>
          Capital Employed = Total Assets â€“ External Liabilities
          <br/>
          = 10,00,000 â€“ 1,80,000
          <br/>
          = â‚¹ 8,20,000
          <br/>
          Normal Profit = Capital Employed Ã— \(\frac { Normal Rate of Return }{ 100 }\)
          <br/>
          = 8,20,000 x \(\frac { 10 }{ 100 }\) = â‚¹ 82,000
          <br/>
          Super Profit = Average Profit â€“ Normal Profit
          <br/>
          = 100,000 â€“ 82000 = â‚¹ 18,000
          <br/>
          (i) Calculation of Goodwill by Capitalisation of Super Profit Method
          <br/>
          Goodwill

          = Super Profit Ã— \(\frac { 100 }{ Normal Rate of Return }\)
          <br/>
          = 18000 x \(\frac { 100 }{ 10 }\) = â‚¹ 180000
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Calculation of Goodwill by Super Profit Method
          <br/>
          Goodwill = Super Profit Ã— Number of Yearsâ€™ Purchase
