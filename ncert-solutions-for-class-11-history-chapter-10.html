         </h3>
<p>
          Question 1.
          <br/>
          Comment on any points of difference between the native peoples of South and North America.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Owing to topographical differences, South Americans were hunter-gatherers, agriculturists and herders. They were simple people contended with their means. In North America, native people used to live in band in villages along the river valleys. They ate fish and meat and cultivated vegetables and maize. The natives of South America maintained empire, while the natives of North America did not maintain it.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 2.
          <br/>
          Other than the use of English, what other features of English economic and social life do you notice in 19th century USA?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          In the 19th century, the landscapes of America changed immensely. The Europeans treated the land in a different way. Some of the migrants from Britain and France were eager to have their own land in America. In the prairie grasslands, people from Poland were happy to work. They wanted to buy huge properties at low cost. They cleared land and developed agriculture. They introduced crops which could not grow in Europe and therefore, could be sold for the profit. To protect their farms they hunted wild animals. With the invention of barbed wire in 1873 they felt totally secured.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 3.
          <br/>
          What did the ‘frontier’ mean to the Americans?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The conquest and purchase of land by the Americans resulted in the extension of boundaries. The natives of America were compelled to move accordingly. The boundary where natives reached was known as ‘Frontier’.

<p>
          Question 4.
          <br/>
          Why was the history of the Australian native peoples left out of the history books?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          European settlers and native peoples interacted on the issue of land after the emergence of North America. They were displaced by the Europeans. Early settlers were convicts deported from England. Hence, they were unknown to the area. They had not even their own tradition and history. Nothing has been written in American and Australian history textbooks about the native peoples. That is why the Australian native peoples were left out of history. It could be made possible from the decade of 1960’s that native peoples started keeping their records.

They exchanged handicrafts and food items. Only those goods were exchanged which were not available in a particular region. The European traders took part in the exchange of food items with an objective to boost their trade. They gave items like blankets, vessels, and gun. These items proved beneficial for the natives in one or another way. Before the advent of the Europeans the natives were not familiar with the wine. But the European made them addicted of wine.

          They had different views as compared to Europeans. The natives considered exchange of gifts between friends as a social behavior but for the Europeans it was just for profit making. The European traders wanted to earn more money by selling items such as fish and fur. The natives were unable to understand why the European traders sometimes offer so much in lieu of exchange of goods and at other time they offer so little for the same. They did not know any thing about trade. Views about the Europeans: They remained unaware about the Europeans for quite a long-time.

          <br/>
          Washington Irving was a famous American writer who personally got a chance to meet North American natives. According to him, they lived with the white people and spoke less. Because they were unaware about their language. When they gathered together, they did not miss even a single chance to entertain themselves by mocking at the Europeans. The Europeans, on the other hand, believed that the natives respected them because they impressed the Indians with their magnificence and glory. But it was a fact that the Europeans did not treat the natives with respect.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The Europeans started to come and settle down in America during 19th century. The possible reasons behind it were the following:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           In France and Britain the younger sons had no right to inherit their father’s property. Therefore, they were eager to buy their own property and took keen interest to settle down in America.
          </li>
<li>
           The farmers of Germany, Italy and Sweden had lost their land to big landlords. Now, they wanted to own some land and migrated to the USA in search of pasture- land.
          </li>
<li>
           The people of Poland also started migrating to America, because here land was available at comparatively less rates. The Polish people were quite happy to work in Prairie grasslands because it reminded them about the steppes to their home town. It encouraged them to buy more land here.

          <br/>
          Both the Europeans and the natives of America had different perceptions regarding forests and agriculture. The Europeans cleared the forests with iron tools to make it ready for agriculture. Doing so they wanted to increase the area under maize and other crops. The natives were surprised at their activities. They never used to grow crops as much as required for subsistence. They never taught about growing crops to make profit. They believed that forests are their source of strength and considered it a sin to cut them. In this way, they had different perceptions regarding forests and agriculture.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          With the expansion of European settlement in America, natives were displaced from the region concerned. The methods adopted by the Europeans to displace the natives were the following:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           They used to inspire the native peoples to abandon those regions.
          </li>
<li>
           In case the natives refused to abandon those areas, they were threatened.
          </li>
<li>
           They had deceitfully acquired more land from the natives and forced them out from here.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          Question 10.
          <br/>
          How did the Europeans justify the displacement of the natives?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The Europeans justified the displacement of the natives by saying that they (the natives) did know the judicious use of their land. They criticized them by calling them sluggish. They were unaware about their crafts skill to produce goods for the market. Natives were also criticized on the ground that they were not interested in learning English and wearing western dress. So they deserved to die out. Wild bisons were killed on a large scale to clear prairies for farmland.

<ul>
<li>
           The Gold Rush: It was expected that there was gold in America. Traces of gold were found in the USA, California in the 1840’s. It only led to the ‘Gold Rush’. A lot of Europeans went to America in the expectation of making a quick fortune. It
          </li>

           also led to the building of railway lines throughout the continent. Thousands of Chinese workers were also recruited.
          </li>
<li>
           Position of natives in Australia: In the late 18th century, there were about 350-750 native communities. Each community had its own language. Most of the communities resided in the north, i.e. called Torres Strait Islanders. Hence, the word, ‘aborigines’ is not used to describe them as they migrated from different places and belonged to a different race.

          Answer:
          <br/>
          The Europeans made no sincere efforts to understand the Australian natives and their culture. It was due to their hostile attitude towards the natives. In their books, the Europeans too described their achievements. It was projected that the natives had neither any indigenous culture, nor had they any history of their own. In 1968 W.E.H. Stanner published his famous book named, “The Great Australian Silence”. In it, he encouraged the Europeans to trace and understand the historical roots of the natives of Australia. It was indeed a commendable step.

          <br/>
          How would you interpret the expansion of the USA? Also discuss the development of agriculture in the USA.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Expansion of the USA
          <br/>
          The USA and Canada came into being towards the end of the 18th century. They occupied only a fraction of land. The imperial power of that time established 13 colonies on its eastern coasts with an objective to gain her independence from Britain. In 1776, they declared a war against Britain.
         </p>
<p>
          This war continued till 1783 and came to an half with the defeat of Britain. In this way, independence of the United States of America came into being. The USA took long time to reach the present boundaries. America started expansion towards the west. To reach its present boundary, the southern region was won from Mexico. This southern expansion of America resulted in the displacement of the natives time and again. By 1892, America reached its present strength.
         </p>
<p>
          Agricultural Development
          <br/>
          The Europeans in America had purchased large size of landholdings. They cleared forests and brought more land under cultivation. They produced crops like rice and cotton. These crops were sold in European market to earn more profits. To protect the crops from the dangers of wild predators they hunted on larger scale. The invention of barbed wire proved to be a milestone in the development of agriculture in America.

<p>
          Question 3.
          <br/>
          What do you know about the slavery system in the USA? How was it abolished? Discuss.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The climatic condition of the southern region was too hot. The Europeans were not able to work outdoors. Their main intention was to employ slaves as workers. The natives of South American colonies who had been enslaved had died in great numbers. As a result, the plantation owners bought slaves in Africa. There was a wide protest by anti¬slavery groups that led to a ban on slave trade. But the Africans who lived in the USA remained slaves.
         </p>
<p>
          The economy of the north was completely different from the south. The northern states of America began to raise their voice against this practice. But the southern states were not interested in abolishing it. This led to a war between the two nations. This war continued till four years, i.e. from 1861 to 1865. The northern states emerged victorious in this war. Hence, the institution of slavery was finally abolished. Abraham Lincoln, the then President of America played a remarkable role in the abolition of slavery.

          Question 4.
          <br/>
          What do you know about wind of change in the USA and Canada?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Till 1920s, the position of the native peoples of the USA and Canada did not improve. In 1928, a survey was conducted by Lewis Menon in which he narrated the grim picture of terribly poor people. The factors responsible for the winds of change were as follows:
          <br/>
          Indian Reorganisation Act, 1934 In 1934, the Indian Reorganisation Act was introduced. Under the provision of this act, the natives living in reserves were given the right to buy land and take loans. Indeed, it was a landmark step in the history of natives. Declaration of Indian Rights, 1954
         </p>
<p>
          Between 1950 to 1960, the Governments of America and Canada thought to abolish all special provisions for the natives. They hoped that the natives will support their ideas to abolish privileges. But the natives did not do it. As a result of this, in 1954 many prepared a document named Declaration of Indian Rights. In it, they said that they will accept the citizenship of America on the terms that their reserves will not be taken back and there will be no interference in tradition.
         </p>
<p>
          In 1969, the government announced that they would not recognise aboriginal rights in Canada. The natives gave their support. They organised opposition by holding debates and a series of demonstrations. By the Constitution Act of 1982, they accepted the existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the natives.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 5.
          <br/>
          Write a description about the winds of change in Australia.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Several factors were responsible for the winds of change in Australia. An account of the factors responsible for winds of change are listed below:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           The Europeans were very hostile towards the natives of Australia. Since a long-time, they (Europeans) made no sincere efforts to improve their conditions. In their literature, the Europeans portrayed themselves superior as compared to the natives. In 1968, W.E.H. Stanner published a book entitled “The Great Australian Silence” that encouraged the Europeans to trace and understand the historical roots of the natives of Australia.
          </li>
<li>
           Henry Reynolds in his book, “Why Weren’t We Told” criticised the tradition of writing of Australian history. According to the Europeans, the history of Australia began with its discovery by Captain Cook. He believed that the study of native culture and civilization must be encouraged. His ideas inspired the Europeans to know about historical antecedents of the natives.
          </li>
<li>
           The Europeans established separate department in universities to study the culture of the natives. To understand the local culture they also established museums and galleries of native art. Undoubtedly, it was a commendable step. It encouraged the Australian government to adopt the policy of multiculturalism. It aimed at providing equal respect for the culture of natives.
          </li>
<li>
           A great Australian writer, Judith Wright spearheaded a powerful movement for the rights of the natives. She was of the opinion that the policy of keeping the whites and the natives separate may pose a great threat to the coming generation. She wrote many impressive poems which had intense effects on the hearts of people.
          </li>
<li>
           The natives realized that the Europeans had made no agreement with them. It was due to this fact that the Australian government always used to call the land, Terra Nullius, which means that land belongs to none. This verdict recognized their claims of natives over the land prior to 1770.
          </li>
<li>
           There was also a long and agonising history of children of mixed blood that was being forcibly captured and separated from their native relatives. These children were denied all sorts of rights.

When the Indians are among themselves, they are great mimics, and entertain themselves excessively at the expense of the whites… who have supposed them impressed with profound respect for their grandeur and dignity… The white men (as I have witnessed) are prone to treat the poor Indians as little better than animals.’

<p>
          ‘Kathy my sister with the torn heart,
          <br/>
          I don’t know how to thank you
          <br/>
          For your Dreamtime stories of joy and grief
          <br/>
          Written on paperbark.
          <br/>
          You were one of the dark children I wasn’t allowed to play with
          <br/>
          Riverbank campers, the wrong colour (I couldn’t turn you white.)
          <br/>
          So it was late I met you,
          <br/>
          Late I began to know
          <br/>
          They hadn’t told me the land I loved
          <br/>
          Was taken out of your hands.’
