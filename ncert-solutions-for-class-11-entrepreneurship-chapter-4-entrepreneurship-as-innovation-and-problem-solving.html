            Answer:
           </strong>
</span>
          (i) 1. National Institute for Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development (NIESBUD).
          <br/>
          2.Indian Institute for Entrepreneurship.
          <br/>
          3.National Institute for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (NIMSME).
          <br/>
          (ii) According to Martin and Osberg, “The Social Entrepreneur aims for value in the form of large-scale transformational benefit that accrues either to a significant segment of society or to society at large.” Moreover, “The social entrepreneur targets his/her programs at the underserved, neglected, or highly disadvantaged population that lacks the financial means or political clout to achieve the transformative benefit on its own.”
          <br/>
          (iii) These are the risks which are related to life and property against fire, theft, accidents, etc. They are covered and protected by insurance.
          <br/>
          (iv) These are the risks whose probability cannot be determined and which cannot be insured against.
          <strong>
           For example:
          </strong>
          Fluctuations in price and demand. These are further divided into two types
          <br/>
<strong>
           (a) Internal Risks:
          </strong>
          Those risks which arise from the events taking place within the business enterprise.
          <br/>
<strong>
           (b) Business risks:
          </strong>
          These are of a diverse nature and arise due to innumerable factors. These risks can be insurable or non-insurable.
          <br/>
          (v) The factors of production land, labour, capital, material, etc. contribute equally towards the development of entrepreneurship in any country. If all the factors are readily available to the entrepreneurs, then entrepreneurship is naturally promoted and developed. But if any of the factor of production are not available or not readily available or available in inadequate quality and quantity, they can become barriers to entrepreneurship.
          <br/>
          (vi)
          <strong>
           (a) Vinoba Bhave:
          </strong>
          He was the founder of the Bhudaan Andolan, which resulted in redistribution of more than 7,000,000 acres of land to aid India’s untouchables and landless.
          <br/>
<strong>

          Lijjat Papad
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Started with a loan of Rs 80, the cooperative now has annual sales exceeding ? 301 crore.
          </li>
<li>
           Lijjat was the brain child of seven Gujarati women from Bombay (now Mumbai).
          </li>
<li>
           The women lived in Lohana Niwas, a group of five buildings in Girgaum. They wanted to start a venture to create a sustainable livelihood using the only skill they had i.e. cooking.
          </li>
<li>
           The women borrowed Rs 80/- from Chhaganlal Karamsi Parekh, a member of the Servants of India Society and a social worker.
          </li>
<li>
           They took over papad making venture which was running in loss owned by Laxmidas Bhai, and bought the necessary ingredients and the basic infrastructure required to manufacture papads.
          </li>
<li>
           On March 15, 1959, they gathered on the terrace of their building and started with the production of 4 packets of papads. They started selling the papads to a known merchant in Bhuleshwar.
          </li>
<li>
           Initially, the women were making two different qualities of papads, in order to sell the inferior one at a cheaper rate.
          </li>
<li>
           Chaganbapa advised them to make a standard papad and asked them never to compromise on quality.
          </li>
<li>
           Lijjat expanded as a cooperative system. Initially, even younger girls could join, but later eighteen was fixed as the minimum age of entry.
          </li>
<li>
           Within three months there were about 25 women making papads.
          </li>
<li>
           Soon the women bought some equipment for the business, like utensils, cupboards, stoves, etc. In the first year, the organization’s annual sales were ? 6196/-. The broken papads were distributed among neighbours.
          </li>
<li>
           During the first year, the women had to stop production for four months during the rainy season as the rains would prevent the drying of the papads. The next year, they solved the problem by buying a cot and a stove. The papads were kept on the cot and the stove below the cot so that the process of drying could take place in spite of the rains.
           <br/>
           By the second year of its formation, 100 to 150 women had joined the group, and by the end of the third year it had more than 300 members. The members were called as Ben/Sister.
          </li>
<li>
           They have accountants in every branch and every centre has to maintain daily accounts.
          </li>
<li>
           Profit (or loss, if any) is shared among all the members of that branch.
           <br/>
           They have a committee of 21, that decides how the profits are to be distributed.
          </li>
<li>
           Each branch calculates its profit and divides it equally among all its members.
          </li>
<li>
           Mumbai has 12,000 members, the rest of Maharashtra has 22,000, and Gujarat has between 5,000 to 7,000 members.
           <br/>
           Exports alone account for ? 10 crores.

<ol>
<li>
<strong>
            Motivational:
           </strong>
           Once the venture starts functioning, the obstacles faced in the initial stages can make the entrepreneurs to lose their commitment and consequently their level of motivation dips. The entrepreneurs who lack toughness and perseverance often quit.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Perceptional:
           </strong>
           Certain perception barriers can hamper the progress of the entrepreneur. Lack of a clear vision and misunderstanding can result in faulty perception. If the entrepreneur demands everything to be clear and well-defined in order to develop a perception, it will lead to disappointment. As entrepreneur’s world is basically disorderly and ambiguous, the people who excessively depend on order will find it a barrier to entrepreneurship.

            Answer:
           </strong>
</span>
          The economic environment can create barriers for an entrepreneur because of the following reasons:

<ul>
<li>
           The capital for setting up the new venture is not accessible for the entrepreneur.
          </li>
<li>
           Non-availability of labour at reasonable cost.

<li>
           If the labour market is unreliable and is fraught with indiscipline and selfishness, it will also become a barrier for entrepreneurship.

          The factors which are responsible for economic development such as land, labour, capital, material, market, etc. are equally responsible for the development of entrepreneurship. Thus, an environment, where all these factors are available to the entrepreneurs, will naturally support and promote entrepreneurship.

          Every society has its own cultural values, beliefs and norms. If the culture of a society is conducive to creativity, risk-taking and adventurous spirit, in such a cultural milieu entrepreneurship will get encouragement.
          <br/>

</span>
          Social factors such as caste structure, mobility of labour, customer needs, cultural heritage, respect for senior citizens, values, etc. might have a far reaching impact on business. In India, attitudes have changed with respect to food and clothing as a result of industrialisation, employment of women in factories and offices, and the increased level of education. This has resulted in the growth of food processing and garment manufacturing units thus the emergence and growth of a new class of entrepreneurs.
          <br/>
          For example: Readymade shirts, instant food, vending machines for tea and eatables.

           </strong>
</span>
          Yes, I agree that there are cultural barriers to entrepreneurship in our society.
          <br/>
          Every society has developed its own cultural values, if the culture of a society is conducive for creativity, risk-taking and adventurous spirit, in such a cultural milieu entrepreneurship will thrive. At the same time, if the cultural values are bound by conventionalism, status- quo, rituals and strong cultural taboos, they may curb entrepreneurial spirit.
          <br/>
<strong>
           For Example:
          </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
           In the past, some societies in India discouraged people from going abroad believing that crossing the sea was a cultural taboo.
          </li>
<li>
           Certain fields of work were considered unsuitable for people of a particular culture.
          </li>
<li>
           In rural areas, negative attitude and discrimination towards women may curb their spirit.
          </li>
<li>
           In India lack of interest and no support of in-laws and husband can be a big barrier to married women entrepreneurs.

<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
</span>
          Economic Environment: All entrepreneur need some important prerequisites to start an enterprise, they are capital, labour, raw material and market. If all these factors of production are easily available to an entrepreneur in an environment, then it will give a natural support to him and easily he can promote entrepreneurship and contribute to economic growth of the country. But, if any of these or all of these factors are either not available or any of them are of inadequate quality or less in quantity, they can become barriers to entrepreneurship.
          <br/>
          For instance,
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           If a prospective entrepreneur does not have access to capital for setting up his/her new enterprise, he or she will feel discouraged to proceed further.
          </li>
<li>
           If capital is available but at an exorbitant rate of interest, it will also discourage entrepreneurship. In olden days it was only due to greedy money-lenders that many people were not able to start their own business.
          </li>
<li>
           Another problem is the availability of labour. However, if the labour is not productive, it will in itself become a barrier.
          </li>
<li>
           If labour of high productivity is not available at reasonable cost, it will inhibit entrepreneurial activities.
          </li>
<li>
           In the labour market, if labour climate is unreliable and is fraught with indiscipline and selfishness then definitely it can discourage entrepreneurs.
          </li>
<li>
           Cut-throat competition in the market.
          </li>
<li>
           Lack of availability of raw materials in desired quantity and quality and availability
           <br/>
           of raw-materials at high prices.
          </li>
<li>
           Problem of infrastructure to transport raw-materials to the factory.
          </li>
<li>
           Inaccessible market for the finished goods can become a serious barrier to entrepreneurship.

            Answer:
           </strong>
</span>
          In the entrepreneurial process the environment plays a vital role because all the opportunities exist in the environment and the entrepreneur is a part of it. A conducive environment throws up more entrepreneurs than an inhibiting environment. An environment where all these factors are available to the entrepreneurs will naturally support and promote entrepreneurship.
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Self-esteem is a very important motive for personality development in the path of an entrepreneur.
          </li>
<li>
           All successful entrepreneurs are highly motivated and their drive to achieve becomes their engine of accomplishment.
          </li>
<li>
           Adequate quality or quantity all of these factors access to capital for setting up his/ her new enterprise.
          </li>
<li>
           Availability of cheap labour of high productivity promotes entrepreneurship. Labour includes skilled, unskilled and technical workforce.
          </li>
<li>
           Availability of raw materials in desired quantity and quality, infrastructure to transport them to the factories and an easily accessible market for the finished goods are some pre-requisites for economic development.
          </li>
<li>
           Every society has developed its own cultural value. If the culture of a society is conducive for creativity, risk-taking and adventurous spirit, in such a cultural milieu entrepreneurship will thrive.
          </li>
<li>
           A conducive political environment that encourages and rewards personal endeavour and hard work and that does not penalize the entrepreneur.
          </li>
<li>
           Toughness and perseverance are certain emotional qualities that are required to boost the level of motivation.
          </li>
<li>
           Sustained motivation is an important asset for an entrepreneur.
          </li>
<li>
           Some political policies can help the growth of entrepreneurial ventures in a country.
          </li>
<li>
           Counselling and support services.
          </li>
<li>
           Government procurement programs for small businesses.
          </li>

           <br/>
           their engine of accomplishment.
          </li>
<li>
           In some societies it can be seen even now that businessmen do not command a high social status. Rather, business is considered a profession of lower hierarchy.
           <br/>
           All these above mentioned factors are interlinked and support entrepreneurship. An entrepreneur must understand and analyse social, cultural, economic technological, continuous change in demand of people, so that he can easily overcome the hurdles during the course of entrepreneurship.

            Answer:
           </strong>
</span>
          Social Environment:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           People are to a great extent bound by the norms, practices of the society in which they live. As a result, the society influences the thought pattern and mind-set of its members. As a matter of fact, the rules of social behaviour are learnt at a very early age.
          </li>
<li>
           If the social norms expect the people to value discipline and conformity over adventure, creativity and independence, it is likely to thwart entrepreneurial spirit. Similarly, if a society puts premium on safety and security in matters of securing a livelihood, such a value can become a strong social barrier to entrepreneurship.
          </li>
<li>
           In some societies it can be seen even now that business people do not command a high social status rather, business is considered a profession of lower hierarchy. They are considered inferior to office-goers, engineers, doctors etc. Such a social response to entrepreneurs can be a big hurdle in developing and nurturing entrepreneurs.
          </li>
<li>
           An excessively protective attitude to children in their formative years, and discouragement to mobility can all thwart creativity, innovative spirit and a sense of adventure, the values that are essential for entrepreneurship.
          </li>
<li>
           Self-esteem is a very important motive for personality development and a society that denies access to it will be placing hurdles in the path of an entrepreneur.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
<span style="color: #993366;">
<strong>
            Question 4. In a given society some people are unable to avail entrepreneurial start in spite of many facilities and incentives. Explain the personal factors which prevent them.

            Answer:
           </strong>
</span>
          Motivational:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Certain shortcomings in the motivational aspect act as barriers to entrepreneurship.
          </li>
<li>
           Many entrepreneurs after starting a new venture faces obstacles in the initial stages, they tend to lose their commitment and consequently their level of motivation dips.
          </li>
<li>
           Lack of tolerance, toughness and perseverance often quit.
          </li>
<li>
           Lack of sustained motivation.
           <br/>
           Perceptional: There are certain perception barriers that can hamper the progress of an entrepreneur.
          </li>
<li>
           Lack of a clear vision and misunderstanding a situation can result in faulty perception.
          </li>
<li>
           All entrepreneurial venture involves some amount of risk taking, however not analysing perception of the risk and the strategy to manage could hamper the growth of an entrepreneur.
          </li>
<li>
           If the entrepreneur demands everything to be clear and well-defined in order to develop a perception, it will lead to disappointment.
          </li>
<li>
           An entrepreneur’s world is basically disorderly and ambiguous, and the entrepreneur should learn to cope with inevitable uncertainties that crop up.
          </li>
<li>
           People who excessively depend on order will find it a barrier to entrepreneurship. They should have a high level of intolerance for ambiguity and chaos because they are breakers of status-quo.
          </li>
</ul>

<strong>
            Question 5. Describe the environmental barriers to entrepreneurship.
           </strong>
</span>

<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
</span>

           </strong>
           The factors of production land, labour, capital, material, etc. contribute equally towards the development of entrepreneurship in any country. If all the factors are readily available to the entrepreneurs, then entrepreneurship is naturally promoted and developed. But if any of the factor of production are not available or not readily available or available in inadequate quality and quantity, they can become barriers to entrepreneurship.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Social:
           </strong>
           Sociological factors such as religion, caste structure, age groups, standard of living, mobility of labour, cultural heritage, respect for senior citizens, values, etc. have a deep impact on business. In India, attitudes have changed with respect to food and clothing, due to changes in educational pattern, rise in standard of living, increase in literacy rate among men and women, employment of women in factories and offices, etc. Due to it there is growth of food processing and garment manufacturing units.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Cultural:
           </strong>
           Every society has its own culture, cultural values, customs, beliefs and norms. If the culture of a society is encouraging creativity and risk-taking, entrepreneurship gets encouragement leading to development.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Political:
           </strong>
           Political factor provides the legal framework for the functioning of the enterprises in the economy. Political environment poses challenge in front of
           <br/>
           entrepreneurs. Political environment is affected by political parties, stability of the government, government’s interference in business world, taxation and subsidies policies etc.

<ol>
<li>
<strong>
            Economic factors:
           </strong>
           These arise due to prevalent economic condition and changes in the prevailing market conditions. These can be of the following types:
           <br/>
           (a) changes in demand
           <br/>
           (b) price fluctuations
           <br/>

            Question 10. Explain the cloud computing.
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
            Answer:
           </strong>
</span>
          The origin of the term ‘cloud’ computing appears to be derived from the practice of using drawings of stylized clouds to denote networks in diagrams of computing and communications systems. The word cloud is used as a metaphor for the internet, based on the standardized use of a cloud-like shape to denote a network.
          <br/>
          Cloud computing helps the firms to upload all its data on to a cloud and then it can be used it remotely wherever it is required.
          <br/>
          By 2016, Gartner—a consultancy firm, expects all Forbes’ Global 2000 companies to use public cloud services, transforming much of the current IT hardware, software and database markets into infinitely flexible utilities.
