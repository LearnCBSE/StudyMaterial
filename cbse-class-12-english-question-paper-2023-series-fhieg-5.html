          Question 1.
          <br/>
          Read the passage given below:
          <br/>
          1. I know many friends of mine who drink coffee regularly but do not know that coffee exists in different forms other than instant coffee. There are many who swear by Flora cafe classic or Coco gold, which they consider premium coffee. I may sound offensive but instant coffee is not the only way; in fact it’s a very bad way of making coffee! Instant coffee cannot match up to brewed coffee’s flavour nor does it have Arabica beans. It uses Robusta beans that are lower in flavour. Don’t know-the difference? Read on…
         </p>
<p>False</p>
<p>—to begin from the beginning—coffee is from a more mature part of the tree—the seed —unlike other stimulants. The ripe berry is picked and de-pulped leaving us with a seed called ‘green bean’ or ‘green coffee’. Green bean is uncharacteristically bland with a taste nowhere close to that of coffee, but it is valued for its higher antioxidant levels.</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;">

          (a) consumed only Flora classics.
          <br/>

          <br/>
          (c) were severely addicted to drinking coffee.
          <br/>
          (d) considered Coco gold as premium coffee.

          Sir
          <br/>
          Through the medium of the columns of your esteemed newspaper I would like to express my concern over the improper disposal of garbage, especially by the tourists while visiting the vacation destinations.
          <br/>
          On my recent visit to Shimla with my family, I was perturbed to see the tourists discarding eijipty water bottles and cans carelessly all over the place. It would not be wrong to state that almost 40% pollution increases during the tourist season because of their careless behaviour Travellers fail to comprehend the far reaching impact of waste and pollution on the environment, wildlife and the local communities making it even work for other visitors. It is the duty of each one of us to da our bit to ensure that all the vacation destinations are left clean and healthy. Used bottles and boxes should not be thrown carelessly, wrappers and leftovers should be disposed only in designated dustbins. If we keep in mind these basic habits, we can set a good example for our young generation.
          <br/>
          I hope you will publish my letter in your newspaper so that people realise the importance of ‘ sustainable’travel.
          <br/>
          Yours sincerely

          (a) SOLAR POWER-AN APT GLOBAL SOLUTION FOR ENERGY CRISIS
          <br/>
          By: Rekha
          <br/>
          The recent and frequent power cuts in our locality macje me feel more strongly that it is actually high time to shift to solar power which is an apt solution for energy crisis. Solar energy, if harnessed efficiently, can substantially reduce not only the energy bill but also reduce the gap in the demand for energy across the country including the remote areas where energy supply is limited. Solar power is renewable energy with low maintenance cost. It is a completely clean source of energy which does not pollute the environment and also reduces dependence on fossil fuels and carbon emissions involved in energy generation. Since India is a tropical country, it has enormous possibility of tapping the abundant solar energy and this will contribute to environmental conservation.
          <br/>
          Solar power is thus a cost effective means of energy which will allow us to lead a low cost and sustainable lifestyle.

          (a) ‘T sometimes find a rupee, even a ten rupee note”, Saheb says, his eyes lighting up when you can find a silver coin in a heap of garbage, you don’t stop scrounging, for there is hope of finding more. It seems that for children, garbage has a meaning different from what it means to their parents. For the children it is wrapped in wonder, for the elders it is a means of survival.
          <br/>
          One winter morning I see Saheb standing by the fenced gate of the neighbourhood club, watching two young men dressed in white, playing tennis. “I like the game”, he hums, content to watch it standing behind the fence. “I go inside when no one is around” he admits. “The gate keeper lets me use the swing”.

          Answer:

          (c) happiness
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) For the elders garbage is _______ and for children it is ______ .
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          For the elders garbage is a means of survival and for children it is wrapped in wonder.

          <br/>
          (a) I is true but II is not
          <br/>
          (b) II is true but I is not
          <br/>
          (c) Both I arid II are true
          <br/>
          (d) Both I and II are untrue
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) I is true but II is not.

          <br/>
          (b) “Or an actress. Now there’s real money in that. Yes, and I could maybe have the boutique on the side. Actresses don’t work full time, do they ? Anyway, that or a fashion designer. You know – something a bit sophisticated”. And she turned in through the open street door leaving Jansie standing in the rain. “If I ever come into money I’ll buy a boutique”. “Huh, if you ever come into money… if you ever come into money you’ll buy us a blessed decent house to live in, thank you very much.” Sophie’s father was scooping shepherd’s pie into his mouth as hard as he could go, his plump face still grimy and sweat — marked from the day. “She thinks money grows on trees, don’t she Dad? Said little Derek, hanging on the back of his father’s chair. Their mother sighed. [6 × 1 = 6]

          Question 12.
          <br/>
          Answer any ONE in about 120-150 words:
          <br/>
          (a) The Last Lesson reflects the flaws in human character that led to the sad plight of people in Alsace. Substantiate your answer with evidences from the text. [5]
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          (b) A Roadside Stand is a social satire depicting the two contrasting worlds existing in society. Justify this statement with reference to the poem. [5]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) The Last Lesson portrays the sad plight of people in Alsace who suffer the consequences of taking their language for granted. They put off learning their language for the next day, which never comes, and thus they can neither read nor write their own language correctly. The people of Alsace are unable to preserve their language and culture, and the Germans while enforcing the new order are insensitive to their feelings. The story reinforces the fact that we value a thing only when it is lost. The pain and anguish of the students and teachers is evident as they realize how they had taken learning their language for granted. They understand that they should have been more attentive to learn their language which would have given them their true identity and respect.
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          (b) Through the two contrasting worlds that exist in society A Roadside Stand depicts the economic inequalities prevalent in society. The rich city folk are shallow and self-centered and thus are indifferent to the sad plight of the poor rural people. The poem is a social satire on the materialistic values that dominate modem society and make the city people’s attitude callous towards the simple country folk.
          <br/>
          Through the contrast between the wealthy and the under-privileged, the poet reveals life’s harsh realities and the hardships of the poor. The rural society represents poverty and struggle while the passing motorists represent prosperity and opulence. The city folk’s conveniently ignoring the roadside stand demonstrates the disregard of the rich to the straggles of the poor.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 13. Answer any ONE in about 120-150 words:
          <br/>
          (a) Mr’. Lamb stands as a symbol of optimism and hope. Support your answer with examples from the text. [5]
          <br/>
          Or, (b) Dr. Sadao emerges as a saviour of humanity. Substantiate your answer with evidence from the text. [5]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Mr. Lamb stands as a symbol of optimism and hope. This is evident as Derry’s chance meeting with Mr. Lamb has a positive impact on him. After his interaction with Mr. Lamb, Derry’s perception towards life undergoes a remarkable change. Mr. Lamb does not let his adverse circumstances let him down. He keeps the gate of his garden always open and welcomes the children even though they call him Lamey-Lamb. Mr. Lamb’s unwavering faith in humanity and his hope for a better tomorrow is evident throughout the story. Mr. Lamb inspires Derry by telling him not to focus on the shortcomings of life and his handicap, but to try and enjoy the Blessings of life.
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          (b) Dr. Sadao rises above narrow prejudices of race and country to help a man in need. He, thus emerges as a saviour of humanity as he overcomes his own animosity and saves the life of an enemy soldier. Dr. Sadao is a skilled surgeon who tends to a dying man, even though that man belongs to the enemy camp, uncaring for his own safety. His act of humanity is heightened when he gives shelter to the American soldier till he is well enough to leave his place and finally he helps the soldier to escape. Dr. Sadao’s selfless act of bravery shows how he willingly puts aside his own personal prejudices in order to do what he should do as a doctor and saves a life.

          Subject: Problem of bullying among school students.
          <br/>
          Sir
          <br/>
          Through the medium of the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I wish to express my ‘ concern about the problem of bullying which has become common among school students.
          <br/>
          I am a counsellor in a reputed school and an quite disturbed by the rising cases of bullying among the school students. Bullying is a rather serious issue that can give long-lasting effects to the mental and emotional well-being of students. It can lead to depression, anxiety, anger issues and stress. Strict measures need to be taken up to end this menace in schools. Anti-bullying policies that clearly define what constitutes bullying and the consequences for engaging in this behaviour need to be implemented. Students need to be educated about the harmful effects of bullying and should also be encouraged to speak out to report and address incidents of bullying promptly. There is also the need to set-up student anti-bullying cell to control this menace,
          <br/>
          I hope you will publish my letter in your newspaper so that we can put an end to the menace of bullying in schools.
          <br/>
          Yours sincerely
          <br/>

          (a) METRO OUR PRIDE
          <br/>
          By: Tanisha
          <br/>
          Metro rail travel is most convenient and hasslefree as it avoids the never-ending traffic Jams in Delhi. It enables us to reach our destination on time and without much problem.
          <br/>
          I travel to office by the metro rail everyday. Besides its expediency, the other thing that delights me is to observe how well maintained it is even after ten years. This is a reflection on the sense of civic responsibility among the citizens today who travel in the most disciplined way. People today are realising the imperative need to keep the metro rails clean. It is an important means of travel that takes millions of people home everyday, so it is our duty to do our bit and ensure that we keep it free from litter. We have to understand that cleanliness is not just the responsibility of the authorities but ours also.
          <br/>
          As citizens of a metropolitan city, who are dependent on metro rail travel it is our responsibility to keep running smoothly and efficiently.

          Our school conducted an Inter-School Debate Competition in the mini auditorium on 20th August, 20xx from 10 A.M. to 2 P.M. Five schools participated in this competition. The judges were a panel of experts in public speaking, communication and critical thinking.
          <br/>
          The topic for the debate was ‘India—The NEW EDUCATION DESTINATION. Each team comprised three participants. One spoke in favour of the motion, one against it and one was the Interjector. The judges evaluated the teams based on their content and delivery. ABC School won the competition. They received the winning trophy and Certificate of Participation was awarded to all the students who participated. The winning team also received a cash prize of fifteen thousand rupees which was sponsored by EdTech Now.
          <br/>
          This debate competition provided a platform for the students to showcase their debating skills and also enhanced their critical thinking and effective communication.

          Question 11.
          <br/>
          Answer any TWO out of three questions given below in about 40-50 words: [2 × 2 = 4]
          <br/>
          (a) What gave Derry the courage to go back to Mr. Lamb’s house despite his mother’s refusal?
          <br/>
          (b) What did the astrologers depict about the child when he was bom? (The Tiger King)
          <br/>
          (c) Why did Geoff Green include young students in his programme?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) It was after his chance meeting with Mr. Lamb that Derry was able to shed his complexes and rediscover the joys of life. Mr. Lamb gives Derry confidence and makes him see life from a different perspective. This gives Derry the courage to go back to Mr. Lamb’s house despite his mother’s refusal.
         </p>
<p>the prince was bom in the hour of the Bull and since the Bull and the Tiger are enemies, his death would come from a Tiger . since the Bull and the Tiger are enemies, his death would come from a Tiger .</p>
<p>Geoff Green included young students in his programme to provide them with inspiring educational opportunities which would help them foster a new understanding and respect for our planet . students are the future generation of policy-makers, so Geoff Green wants to offer them a life-changing experience at an age when they can absorb, learn and act.</p>

          Subject: Online Teaching-Impact and Solutions.
          <br/>
          Sir
          <br/>
          Through the medium of the columns of your esteemed newspaper I wish to give my views and express my concerns about the challenges involved in online teaching. Online teaching has become increasingly popular after the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is convenient and accessible but a fine balance needs to be maintained to ensure that its adverse affects are minimised. One major issue with Online teaching is that it can at times lead to social isolation. Moreover, with students glued to their seats during Online classes their physical activity is reduced and this can cause obesity in the long run. To reduce the negative impacts of Online teaching, conscious efforts should be made by parents and teachers to reiterate to the children the need for physical activity and also to take out time for constructive leisure. Online teaching can become a more effective tool for education if these adverse affects are dealt with.
          <br/>
          I hope you will publish my letter in your newspaper to make the readers aware about how to address the concerns of Online teaching.
          <br/>
          Yours sincerely
          <br/>

          (a) ANNUAL SPORTS DAY CELEBRATIONS
          <br/>
          By: Kanika (Student Reporter)
          <br/>
          Our school celebrated Annual Sports Day on 29th November, 20xx in the school ground. The entire school ground was decorated and it looked as if there was a festival in the school. The students were rather enthusiastic about the sports activities and events of the day. The District Collector was the Chief Guest of the function. The event was inaugurated by the flame lighting ceremony in which the flame was carried by our students who had excelled in sports. Then followed a March Past by the students of the four different houses. The sports events included the 100 m race, relay race, Javelin throw and other running competitions. The Chief Guest then awarded the prizes and gave a speech to encourage the students to give sports an equal priority as they do to academics.
          <br/>
          The event ended with our Principal Sir proposing the vote of thanks to the Chief Guest and . the parents and praising the staff and students for their commendable performance.

          (b) THE CHEETAHS AND ECOLOGICAL BALANCE
          <br/>
          By: Bela
          <br/>
          The return of the Cheetahs will help in the restoration of open forests and grass land ecosystems in India. This will help not only to maintain the ecological balance of nature but also conserve bio-diversity, wild life and soil.
          <br/>
          Cheetahs are considered as the keystone species of the ecosystem, as they help in maintaining the balance of the food chain. Being the apex predators, they control the population of herbivores. This, in turn, prevents overgrazing and helps in the regeneration of vegetation, thereby increasing the growth of a diverse variety of plant species. The reintroduction of cheetahs will also help in soil conservation. Overgrazing by herbivores often leads to soil erosion which affects ecosystem productivity. The presence of Cheetahs will regulate herbivore population, which will prevent overgrazing and maintain soil health. Restoring open forests and grasslands will improve soil-water retention capacity thereby reducing the risk of soil erosion.
          <br/>
          Thus, the return of the Cheetahs has the potential to be a game-changer and have a positive impact on the health and productivity of the ecosystem.
