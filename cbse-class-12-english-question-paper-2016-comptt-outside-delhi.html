          Question 1.
          <br/>
          Read the passage carefully: [12]
          <br/>
          1. In 1991, Linnet visited a relative’s secluded village named Bhuira. Getting there was a backbreaking drive through the unpaved roads. Nestled among orchards and deodar woods, it delighted Linnet, who loves mountains and everything that grows there. Linnet and her husband soon bought a house with an acre of orchard. Peaches, apricots, plums and kiwis grew in and around Bhuira, along with Himachal’s famous apples. What concerned her was how so much of all that precious produce just went waste. Linnet had always baked and made jams, growing up as she did with the excellent seasonal produce of Somerset in England. She says her only qualification was that she knew how jam should taste. She began gathering the fallen fruit to make apple jelly.
         </p>
<p>
          2. Today, Linnet not only produces what many consider India’s best jams, she’s single- handedly brought employment and prosperity to the farmers and the women of Bhuira village. Coming to India and setting up a house, she threw herself heart and soul into being an Indian wife. She wore sarees, became fluent in Hindi, and enjoyed making Kashmiri Pandit food. Linnet soon started looking like an Indian. “We could never find proper jams in India,” says Linnet. “There was this sugary red stuff that was called mixed fruit jam. So I started making jams with whatever I could lay hands on. The original mixed fruit jam was made by farmers’ wives in England when they had no time to make separate jams. So they put them all in one pot.
         </p>
<p>
          3. Later in Bhuira, her jam became so popular that it got her thinking of expanding. “And the village women needed cash. At that time they had none,” Linnet recalls. Step by step, her dream took shape. There were negotiations with the authorities. The government set too many checks and didn’t realise how the jams could create more employment and help the local economy. Finally, she got the (FPO) Fruits Products Order Licence. A manufacturing unit was constructed close to the cottage and she started production in 1999. Initially, nobody took her seriously. In and around Bhuira, much of the fruit harvest had earned local farmers next to nothing because they didn’t have the means to box and transport such quantities , even to the nearest markets. Now even farmers with a few trees could just walk to the factory with their crop. Soon the women of Bhuira joined her. Linnet taught them the ways of jam-making as it had been passed down from her mother. The legend on the label of a Bhuira jam now reads, “Created by happy mountain women.”
         </p>

<p>
          4. Theif products quickly got sold out. The smiling girl brigade at the factory glow with a pride that’s almost visible. “They are hard-working and love the idea that jams bear the name of their village. Their income adds to the little they get from farms. They now also have their own self-help group to,.invest their precious earnings,” says Linnet. The factory has become a lifeline for many women – most of them not educated. Bhuira jam has now become a brand name in its own right. The all women operation needs many workers since every thing – sorting, chopping and cooking is done manually, which is what makes these jams unique. The jams have no artificial preservatives in them. Lime juice, apple juice and sugar are used as preservatives in the traditional manner.

          Question 2.
          <br/>
          Read the passage given below carefully: [8]
          <br/>
          1. Cholesterol is a waxy substance that is present in our body. It’s an important component of our cell walls and other tissues, but it is thought to be harmful if in excess. It can lead to blockages caused by plaque formation in the heart’s arteries causing heart disease and heart attacks. Such blockages can also happen in arteries, in the legs or in the brain. Cholesterol is produced in the liver, and the amount produced is influenced by our genes. The food we consume, too, has effect on cholesterol levels. Fatty foods, especially those high in saturated fats, and foods high in simple sugars such as cold drinks increase cholesterol levels. Lack of physical activity and exercise also leads to elevated levels.
         </p>
<p>
          2. We can reduce cholesterol levels by following a heart-healthy lifestyle, which includes regular physical activity for at least 30 minutes daily and a diet high in fruits and vegetables and low in saturated sugar. Statins are the group of drugs most recommended for those with high cholesterol. Red yeast rice has been shown to be effective in lowering cholesterol. Include garlic and flaxseed in your daily diet. Olive oil, Canola oil or other oils rich in monounsaturated fatty acids can be used for cooking in order to reduce cholesterol through food.
         </p>
<p>
          3. The ill effects of high cholesterol take time to show, and you may not realise it until it’s a bit too late. Cholesterol, by itself is important because it insulates nerve cells and membranes. Being a fatty substance, it does not dissolve in the blood and is packaged into protein. There are the ‘good’ HDL cholesterol and ‘bad’ LDL cholesterol. Bad cholesterol can stick to the smooth lining of the blood vessels, where it is absorbed, while HDL mops up excess bad cholesterol and removes it from blood vessels. Even moderate physical activity can help increase HDL cholesterol.
         </p>
<p>
          4. Exercise five days a week, whether you are overweight or underweight. Aerobic exercises like walking, cycling, swimming, slow jogging, dancing etc. for 45 minutes, three times a week and anaerobic exercises like weight training, and sprinting, for another three days will help increase good and reduce bad cholesterol. In order to maximize your cardiovascular fitness, aerobic exercises should raise your heart rate to a certain level. This level is called your target heart zone. Keep your heart rate elevated for at least 20 minutes. Always warm up, stretch, and cool down-relax-before and after any workout to avoid injuries. All these contribute to a healthier and fitter life.

          Subject: Too many advertisements during television serials
          <br/>
          Sir
          <br/>
          Through the medium of the columns of your esteemed newspaper I wish to protest against the growing number of advertisements during television serials.
          <br/>
          There are many good programmes that one wants to watch on T.V. but the interruption caused due to too many advertisements leads to loss of interest of the viewer, irritation and anger that finally leads to poor TRPs.
          <br/>
          It is a known fact that advertising revenue is the life-blood of the media but there must be consideration for the viewers who are mainly responsible for low and high TRPs of a programme. A highly commercial attitude of the channel will certainly not go in its favour as far as viewership is concerned. It is my suggestion that only a limited number of advertisements should be telecast during serials and other programmes.
          <br/>
          I hope you will publish my letter in your newspaper so as to enable the television channel management to take a serious note of this matter.
          <br/>
          Yours sincerely

          Question 5.
          <br/>
          Parents keep on saving money to bg’Spent on the weddings of their children. This money could have been spent, instead on their education. Write an article in 150-200 words on ‘Importance of simple weddings’. You are Anu/Anurag. [10]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          IMPORTANCE OF SIMPLE WEDDINGS
          <br/>
          By: Anu
          <br/>
          It is the responsibility of every parent to give a decent upbringing and education to their child. But unfortunately, there are still some parents who compromise on their child’s education, especially if their child is a girl, and instead save money to be spent on her wedding.
          <br/>
          The basic social structure in our country is such where the marriage of a girl is more important than her education. It is a rather costly affair and the parents spend all their life-savings for this grand and extravagant event. They do not want to compromise on the expenditure of their daughter’s marriage so they end up compromising on her education instead. Many a time parents want their daughters to get a good education with the sole purpose of enhancing her matrimonial prospects.
          <br/>
          The need of the time is to give a girl’s education topmost priority. The concept of simple marriage should be promoted. The money spent on a girl’s education is actually an investment. Let us remember marriage is an important but not the ultimate purpose of a girl’s life. It is only a part of it and a choice some girls probably do not wish to make. So a girl should be given good education, good morals and she must be encouraged to pursue her passions.
          <br/>
          After all, a parent’s main concern is the welfare of their daughter, so they should make a start by placing the control of her future in her own hands by giving her a good education.

          Question 5.
          <br/>
          Parents keep on saving money to be’Spent on the weddings of their children. This money could have been spent, instead on their education. Write an article in 150-200 words on ‘Importance of simple weddings’. You are Anu/Anurag. [10]
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          IMPORTANCE OF SIMPLE WEDDINGS
          <br/>
          By: Anu
          <br/>
          It is the responsibility of every parent to give a decent upbringing and education to their child. But unfortunately, there are still some parents who compromise on their child’s education, especially if their child is a girl, and instead save money to be spent on her wedding.
          <br/>
          The basic social structure in our country is such where the marriage of a girl is more important than her education. It is a rather costly affair and the parents spend all their life-savings for this grand and extravagant event. They do not want to compromise on the expenditure of their daughter’s marriage so they end up compromising on her education instead. Many a time parents want their daughters to get a good education with the sole purpose of enhancing her matrimonial prospects.
         </p>
<p>
          The need of the time is to give a girl’s education topmost priority. The concept of simple marriage should be promoted. The money spent on a girl’s education is actually an investment. Let us remember marriage is an important but not the ultimate purpose of a girl’s life. It is only a part of it and a choice some girls probably do not wish to make. So a girl should be given good education, good morals and she must be encouraged to pursue her passions.
          <br/>
          After all, a parent’s main concern is the welfare of their daughter, so they should make a start by placing the control of her future in her own hands by giving her a good education.

          It has been the talk of the town, that behaviour of youngsters is changing due to their excessive use of mobile phones. You have been asked to speak in the morning assembly of your school on this topic:’Write the speech in 150-200 words. [10]

          Answer:
          <br/>
          It has been the talk of the town that the behaviour of youngsters is changing due to their excessive use of mobile phones.
          <br/>
          Good morning everyone, I have come before you all to talk on this topic.
          <br/>
          The youth of today are so glued to their mobile phones that they avoid the real world and live-in a world of virtual reality. They pressurize their parents to buy them the latest gadgets so that they can show off and flaunt it among their peer group. They waste precious time on their mobile phone whether it is to text messages, play games or listen to music. Youngsters now have no time to interact with their parents and family. Excessive use of mobile phones is one of the major causes of accidents, conflicts, low academic result and stressful relationships among youngsters and this needs to be tackled most seriously.

          You are Radha, a well-known writer of short stories for children. You have been invited as the chief guest in a school which is celebrating its Annual Day. You decide to talk to them about the importance of story books. Write a speech for her in 150-200 words.
          <br/>
          Ans. It has been a pleasure and an honour for me to be invited as the chief guest for your Annual Day. I would like to congratulate the principal, the teachers and all the students for putting up a spectacular performance.
          <br/>
          I would also like to take this opportunity to talk to you about the importance of story books, since I write short stories for children and always encourage children to appreciate reading. Unfortunately, most children of today lack the habit of reading story books. They say they do not have the time and some just do not even have the inclination to read.
         </p>
<p>
          Let me remind you children that reading story books helps in character building and moral growth in your formative years. It also helps to boost creativity and intellect. Morals of many stories that we read can be connected to real life. You must understand that books have been and always will be a useful source of information and that good reading skills are important for success in our future lives.
          <br/>
          I would like to conclude by emphasizing the fact that reading will enhance your confidence level and enable you to cope with your feelings more effectively.

          (a) What kind of life did Saheb lead at Seemapuri?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Most of the people like Saheb-e-Alam settled in Seemapuri were refugees from Bangladesh who had fled their country and migrated to Delhi from Dhaka in the wake of the 1971 Indo-Pak war. Their dwellings were structures of mud, tin and tarpaulin with no sewage, drainage or running water. Picking garbage and rags helped them to earn their daily bread, gave them a roof over their heads and was their only means of livelihood and survival. Though these squatters of Seemapuri have no identity but they do have valid ration cards that enable them to buy grain. Living in Seemapuri, which is on the periphery of Delhi, is like living in hell. Children here grow up to become partners in survival to their parents. An army of barefoot children appears every morning, carrying their plastic bags on their shoulders and disappear by noon. They are forced to live a life of abject poverty that results in the loss of childhood innocence.
          <br/>
          Saheb, a ragpicker, roamed in the streets, scrounging for garbage, barefoot and deprived of education. Later he starts working in a tea stall but he loses his freedom and carefree life as he is no longer his own master.

She told her brother that she had met Danny Casey in the arcade. When she was looking at the clothes in Royce’s window someone came and stood beside her and she looked around and saw Danny. She also told Geoff that Danny Casey has gentle, green eyes and he is not as tall as one would think him to be. She also asked Danny for his autograph but could not get it as none of them had a paper or pen with them. Sophie’s dream world makes her travel into those aspects of life which she may never be able to achieve in reality.

          Jo was Jack’s four year old daughter who loved to listen to the stories which Jack himself created. Each story that Jack narrated to her was a slight variation of a basic tale. One day’s story was about Roger Skunk, a new animal who smelt so bad that the other little creatures never played with him due to this. When Roger Skunk told his tale to the wise owl, he advised him to go to the wizard. The wizard made Roger smell like roses but when Roger returned home his mother was so annoyed that she went to the wizard and hit him on the head. The wizard made Roger Skunk smell bad again. Jo did not like the end of the story. For Jo, Roger’s mother is wicked and she is very annoyed with her for making Roger smell bad again. Jo is a child who lives in an idealised world which is reigned by beauty and love.

          So she wants her father to change the story’s ending wherein the wizard should hit mommy,with her magic wand and punish her for being stupid. Jo wanted Roger Skunk to have friends.

          <br/>
          Through the medium of the columns of your esteemed newspaper I would like to complain about the lack of street lights in our locality at Station Road.
          <br/>
          I would like to apprise that our locality is inhabited by thousands of residents living in more than 1,000 flats on either side of the road. The electricity board has installed poles on the road to supply light but these poles have never been lit. During these days of winter, when it turns dark early, there is always an apprehension of an accident taking place because there is heavy traffic on the road round the clock.
          <br/>
          Moreover, it is extremely risky for children, ladies and old people to venture out in the dark. It is a convenient invitation to miscreants. It is our request to the concerned authorities to ensure that the street lights are fixed and lit up without further delay so that the residents can carry out their daily activities without fear even during the evening.
          <br/>
          I am sure if my letter is published in your esteemed newspaper, the authorities concerned will awaken from their slumber and our problem will be solved.

          <br/>
          1 am very anxious and worried ever since and have recently heard about more such incidents from other parents. There is fear among the children and it is my request to you to take strict action against this problem. The harassed children need to be given moral support and the miscreants need to be dealt with strictly. The school should also arrange for their counselling and may I also suggest that the school authorities take the help of parents in tackling this problem at its root level.
          <br/>
          Such cases need to be stopped to maintain the healthy environment of the school and I am sure you will deal with this problem with immediate effect.

          (c) Gandhiji was unhappy with the lawyers in Muzzafarpur as they were collecting a huge fee from the peasants.

          Question 9.
          <br/>
          Answer the following in 120-150 words: [6]
          <br/>
          Describe the living conditions prevailing in Firozabad. Mention why the bangle making business does not give bangle makers a comfortable life.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Through the story of the bangle-makers of Ferozabad, the author expresses her concern over their exploitation in the hazardous job of bangle-making. Extreme poverty, hard work and dismal working conditions result in the loss of the childhood of children who are in this profession. The working conditions of all bangle-makers are pathetic and miserable. They work in high temperature, badly lit and poorly ventilated glass furnaces due to which child workers especially are at risk of losing their eyesight at an early age. The stinking lanes of Ferozabad are choked with garbage and humans and animals live together in these hovels. There is no development or progress in their lives with the passage of time. They have no choice but to work in these inhuman conditions. Mind- numbing toil kills their dreams and hopes. They are condemned to live and die in squalor, subjected to a life of poverty and perpetual exploitation.

          Geoff and Sophie are different from each other, though they belong to the same family. Comment with examples from the text.
          <br/>
          Ans. Though Geoff and Sophie belong to the same family they are very different from each other. Geoff, Sophie’s elder brother is an apprentice mechanic who travelled to work to the far side of the city everyday. He lived in reality and spoke little. In fact Sophie felt that words had to be prized out of him like stone out of the ground. He had a life of his own and though he listened to Sophie’s fantasies, he did not believe her. Sophie, on the other hand, lived in a dream world. She dreams of having a boutique, becoming an actress or a fashion designer. She is a day-dreamer and an incurable escapist. She imagines meeting the football prodigy Danny Casey. Geoff is the most important member of her family for Sophie who wishes to be admitted into her brother’s affections so that some day he might take her with him to meet the exotic and interesting people whom he never spoke about.

          (a) Describe how Dr. Sadao met his life partner in America.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Dr. Sadao was a dutiful son who was aware that his education was his father’s chief con¬cern. So at the age of twenty-two Sadao’s father sent him to America to study surgery and medicine. He had met his wife, Hana in America. He had ‘found’ Hana casually and by chance at an American professor’s house. The professor and his wife were kind people anxious to help out their foreign students. Dr. Sadao had gone to the professor’s house most reluctantly and there he had found Hana. He had not married Hana heedlessly in America. The two had finished their work at school, had come home to Japan and when his father had approved of her, their marriage was arranged in the traditional Japanese way. Dr. Sadao had returned from America at the age of thirty as a full-fledged qualified surgeon.

          (b) How did Zitkala-Sa face discrimination in the Carlisle Indian School?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The first day in the land of apples was bitterly cold and as the bell rang for breakfast, there was an annoying clatter of shoes which gave Zitkala-Sa no peace. Though her spirit tore itself in struggling for its freedom, it was of no use. Zitkala-Sa was placed in a line with the Indian girls and marched into the dining room. All the girls were rather immodestly dressed in tightly,fitting clothes. As Zitkala-Sa sat down she observed that she was being keenly watched by a strange palefaced woman. Later her friend Judewin gave her a terrible warning that this palefaced woman was talking about cutting their long, heavy hair. Zitkala-Sa crept into a room and crawled under a bed and huddled herself in the dark corner. But women and girls entered the room and dragged her out. She resisted by kicking and scratching wildly. Inspite of her resistance she was carried downstairs, tied fast in a chair and her long hair was shingled.
         </p>
<p>
          Add: Zitkala-Sa was a victim of racial discrimination. In the Carlisle Indian School she was humiliated by being forced to dress immodestly in tight clothes and stiff shoes. Her blanket was stripped off her shoulders. She was made to eat by formula. Her hair was shingled and she was robbed off her identity.

          Question 6.
          <br/>
          Life in cities is not as safe as it used to be. People feel more at risk today. The police department of your city has been laying emphasis on public safety through exhibitions, mock drills and seminars. Write an article in 150-200 words on ‘How to ensure safe life in cities’. You are Aman/Anamika. [10]

          Answer:

          HOW TO ENSURE SAFE LIFE IN CITIES
          <br/>
          By: Aman
          <br/>
          Living in a city enables people to advance socially and economically. However many challenges exist for people living in cities. One of the main challenges is the question of the safety of city dwellers.
          <br/>
          Crimes like kidnapping, murder, rape, robberies, chain-snatching and crimes against women and senior citizens are most common. The reasons for these can be attributed to unemployment, illiteracy, greed and the desire to maintain high status by acquiring easy money. We cannot always hold our legal system and the police responsible for the rise of crime rate in cities. It is the duty of each one of us to be vigilant at all times and to ensure our safety.
         </p>
<p>
          The police certainly need to be more active and vigilant. Offenders need to be punished most stringently so as to deter others about the repercussions in case they commit the same crime. Parents need to inculcate moral values in their children from a very young age so that they grow up clearly understanding the difference between right and wrong.
          <br/>
          The government should generate more employment opportunities to ensure that the number of the unemployed youngsters in our country does not rise.
          <br/>
          It is defihitely the collective responsibility of our government, the police department and each one of us to strive for a safe and secure city.
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          Villages are lacking in basic facilities like clean drinking water, proper sanitation etc. As a result people suffer from various diseases. Write an article in 150-200 words on ‘Rural Health’. You are Arun/Karuna.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          RURAL HEALTH
          <br/>
          By: Karuna
          <br/>
          Rural health care is one of the biggest challenges facing the Health Ministry of India. With more than seventy per cent of our population living in rural areas and the low level of health facilities, mortality rates due to diseases are on a high. So, rural life is healthy is more of a myth.
          <br/>
          Healthcare is the right of every individual but lack of quality infrastructure, dearth of qualified medical functionaries and non-accessibility to basic medicines and medical aid thwarts its reach to more than sixty per cent of population that lives in rural India. Basic amenities like clean drinking water, a proper sewage and drainage system and the facility of toilets is still not available to our major rural population.
          <br/>
          Several organisations are working alongwith the government and NGOs to improve the rural health system in India. People living in rural areas need to be made aware of the importance of cleanliness and sanitation. Regular health check camps should be set-up at primary health centres in rural areas. Health-Melas should be organised to spread health awareness among the masses.
          <br/>
          Growth in national income is not enough by itself if its benefits do not manifest themselves in the form of better health facilities for all.
