<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
</span>
          The principle is named for Vilfredo Pareto, an Italian economist who studied land ownership in Italy in the early 1900’s and found that roughly 20 per cent of the population held title to about
          <br/>
          80 per cent of the land. Pareto’s law has applications throughout science as well as business, including inventory control, where it forms the basis for a technique called ABC analysis.

<strong>
            Question 1. What is ABC analysis?
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
</span>
          ABC analysis is an inventory categorization method which consists in dividing items into three categories (A, B, C):
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           A being the most valuable items.
          </li>
<li>
           B-items are the inter class items, with a medium consumption value.
          </li>
<li>
           C being the least valuable ones.
           <br/>
           This method aims to draw managers’ attention on the critical few (A-items) not on the trivial many (C-items).

            Question 2. What is Pareto’s Principle?
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
</span>
          In 1906, Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto noted that 80% of Italy’s land was owned by 20% of the people. Pareto principle is a prediction that 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. The 80:20 ratio of cause-to-effect became known as the Pareto Principle. He became somewhat obsessed with this ratio, seeing it in everything. For example, he observed that 80% of the peas in his garden came from 20% of his pea plants.

<span style="color: #993366;">
<strong>
            Question 1. What is a budgeting process?
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
</span>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
           Budgeting is a collective process in which operating units prepare their plans in conformity with corporate goals published by top management.
          </li>
<li>
           Each unit plan is intended to contribute to the achievement of the corporate goals.
          </li>
<li>
           Unit managers prepare projections of sales, operating costs, overhead costs, and capital requirements. They calculate operating profits and returns on the investment they intend to use.
           <br/>
           The budget itself is the projection of these values for the next calendar or fiscal year.
           <br/>
           In this process, each unit presents its plans and budget to a reviewing upper management panel and may, thereafter, make whatever changes result from instructions or negotiations with the higher level.
           <br/>
           Texts presenting, documenting, and defending the rationales underlying the numbers are usually part of the planning document.
           <br/>
           Approved budgets then become the road¬map for operations in the coming year. Ideally monthly or quarterly budget reviews track performance against the budget.
           <br/>
           As part of such reviews, changes to the budget may be approved. At the end of year managers are judged by their performance against the budget.

<strong>
            Question 3. Explain the two dominant forms of budgeting process.
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
          Ans. The two dominant forms of budgeting processes are traditional and zero- based. Business planning is usually a combination of the two.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Traditional budgeting:
          </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
           It is based on a review of historical performance and then the projection of such findings to the future with modifications.
          </li>
<li>
           If inflation is high, for instance, cost trends of the last several years are projected forward but with adjustments both for inflation and for projected growth or decline in business activity.
          </li>
<li>
           Historical sales patterns, using established trends in sales growth, are projected; new sales from planned new product introductions are then added.
          </li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
           Zero-based budgeting:
          </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
           It is the creation of a completely new budget from the ground up—as if no history existed.
          </li>
<li>
           When using this method, the operation must justify and document every item of expenditure and income anew.

</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
</span>
          Money needed to fund the normal, day- to-day operations of a business is known as the working capital.
          <br/>
<img alt="NCERT Solutions for Class 12 Entrepreneurship Business Arithmetic Textbook Questions LAQ Q4" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-119762" height="256" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-12-Entrepreneurship-Business-Arithmetic-Textbook-Questions-LAQ-Q4.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-12-Entrepreneurship-Business-Arithmetic-Textbook-Questions-LAQ-Q4.png 314w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-12-Entrepreneurship-Business-Arithmetic-Textbook-Questions-LAQ-Q4-300x245.png 300w" width="314"/>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
           Adequate working capital is required for the smooth running of any business.
          </li>
<li>
           It is required by a business for meeting day to day business expenses to complete a business cycle or the operating cycle.
          </li>
</ol>
<p>
          The working capital of a business keeps on circulating or changing since the money circulates in various forms of assets in a continued manner.
         </p>
<p>
          The above diagram explains that:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           In a business concern operating cycle begins with outflow of cash towards the purchase of raw materials, payment of labour, power, fuel and other expenses converting the raw materials into work in progress and converting them into finished goods. Sale of finished good for cash or credit.
          </li>
<li>
           If on credit then conversion of account receivables into cash.

</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
           Total Current Assets = Debtors + Stock + Cash + Short term investment Total Current Assets = (Rs 75000 + Rs 50,000 + Rs 1,00000 + Rs 76,000) Total Current Assets = Rs 3,01,000

<strong>

          Grocery store is a trading business. One buys and sells. So, the cost at which the items are purchased is known as Unit Cost (just as its MRP at which you are selling). Therefore, at the end of the day, it is possible to know the purchase price of all the items and quantities that were sold. Let us suppose that it works out to Rs 1,70,000. There are 100 units of Sale. So the unit cost is Rs 1,700.

            Answer.
           </span>
</strong>
          The length of time a product may be stored without becoming unsuitable for use or consumption. Items like vegetables, fruits, flowers and fish are perishable in nature. This calls for special storage conditions and equipments – cold storage, freezers, etc. These have financial implications. Similarly some of the manufactured food or medicinal products have expiry dates – beyond which they are not fit for consumption. This imposes certain constraints on inventory management.

            Question 5. When an entrepreneur’s business is expanding, his business outflows can be more than his business inflows. Do you agree. How?

</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
</span>
          Yes, when an entrepreneur’s business is expanding, his business outflows can be more than his business inflows. It is so because there is always a lag between your spending (on raw materials, labour, etc.) and receiving the sales revenue. Receipt of sales revenue may be delayed because he might have given credit or you have produced ahead of the sales (to cater to the high demand during festive season) and are temporarily holding finished goods stock.

            Question 7. What do you mean by Reorder Point? How it is calculated?
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
</span>
          It is a level at which a new order must be placed so that the inventory is renewed before the stock reaches zero level. It is estimated by using the formula: Reorder Point = Usage Rate x Lead Time
          <br/>
          Example: Suppose a company uses 15 units of an item per day (usage rate, and the order lead time is 10 days, a new order must be placed when the inventory level reaches 150 units (Reorder Point 150 = Usage Rate 15 x Lead Time 10) so that inventory is replenished before a stock out occurs.

</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
</span>
          Inventory means list of materials used in a business. An entrepreneur must be very careful and wise while deciding about the level of inventory. An entrepreneur must avoid overstocking and under-stocking of each item of the inventory.
          <br/>
          The factors that influence the decision on such orders are:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           Order lead time
          </li>
<li>
           Usage rate or rate of consumption
          </li>
<li>
           Reorder-point or minimum quantity of the item to be kept.
           <br/>
           An entrepreneur must maintain the supply line in a proper manner so that at any time he may have adequate flexibility to change the process of production according to customer’s requirement.

            Question 20. Explain trading on equity with the help of a suitable example.
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
</span>
          Trading on equity relates to a situation when the debt component is likely to provide higher rate of return on share capital.
          <br/>
          Debt and equity are the two sources of finances. Both have their own merits and demerits.But when a mix of both is used wisely, the rate of return equity can increase. This is because the interest paid on the loan is deductible from earning before tax payment. The payment of dividend is only made after realizing the interest.

            Question 23. Name and explain the chief cost of budget process.
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
</span>
          The chief cost of the budget process is time. In some corporations the process takes on a life of its own and becomes a convoluted exercise of excessive complexity which, moreover, prevents unit managers from doing any thinking: their time is consumed in efforts to comply with a vast array of requirements dictated from above.
          <br/>
          Much of the negative attitude that has developed concerning this activity has its roots in unnecessary bureaucratic impositions on the one hand and unreliability because of the rapid change, a few months out.

            Question 25. Explain the concept of ROI (Return on Investment).
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
</span>
<strong>
           Meaning:
          </strong>
          It is the ratio of net profit before interest and tax and total investment.
          <strong>
           Significance:
          </strong>
          The significance of computing this ratio is to find out how efficiently the long term funds supplied by the outsiders or creditors and owners are being used.
          <br/>
          It gives an indication of how the total money is being used.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Example:
          </strong>
          If an entrepreneur spends X 100,000 to open a grocery shop and makes a net profit of? 20,000 in one year, your annual ROI equals (20,000/100,000) x 100 = 20 per cent.
          <br/>
          When calculating ROI, the investment will include not only what the investor spent out of his/her pocket, but also all borrowed funds.

</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
</span>
<strong>
           Meaning:
          </strong>
          It is the ratio of net profit after interest and tax and owner’s investment.
          <strong>
           Significance:
          </strong>
          The significance of computing this ratio is to find out how efficiently the owners funds supplied by the shareholders/owners are being used. Example, if Sushmita the owner of a grocery shop has an equity stake of Rs 70,000 in the business, she has borrowed Rs 30,000 (rate of interest is 10%).
          <br/>
          This will attract an interest of 3,000 @ 10% per annum.
          <br/>
          If the Net Profit is Rs 14,000 then:
          <br/>
          ROE=Rs 14,000/Rs 70,000 x 100 =20%

</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
</span>
<strong>
           Step 1:
          </strong>
          Every enterprise has different guidelines and rules and regulations. It is based on the business charateristics, decides on the frequency and period (day, week or month) as well as horizon (month, 13 weeks or 6 months).
          <br/>
<strong>
           Step 2:
          </strong>
          Develop the format, with items appropriate for your business, which will be used for developing the projection. You may take help from the formats attached here as sample.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Step 3:
          </strong>
          A projected cash flow begins with the existing cash balance for the business. It then lists the sources of inflow and the anticipated payment dates.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Step 4:
          </strong>
          For example, if you supply goods on credit, you will know at the start of February that you will receive a certain amount during the month covering sales from January – based on credit terms. You may have other inflows interest on your deposits, sale of scrap, rent from space sub-let etc. In this manner, you add up all your inflows.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Step 5:
          </strong>
          The statement then looks at forthcoming expenditure. Some of this will be a fixed, regular sum such as staff costs. Other expenses will be known but only payable at certain times, such as taxes. There will also be variable costs such as buying stock or materials.
          <br/>
<strong>
           Step 6:
          </strong>
          Where payment dates are variable, it is usually safest to work on the basis that you will pay suppliers as soon as possible but not receive payment from customers until the last possible date. Step 7: In short, be conservative in assumptions.
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           Adding all outflows enables you arrive at the surplus or deficit for the period.
          </li>
<li>
           Combined with the opening balance, leads to deriving the closing balance.
          </li>
<li>
           It becomes opening balance for the next period.

<strong>
            Question 2. What is EOQ? How it is calculated?
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
</span>
          Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) is an important tool in the purchase of raw materials and storage of finished goods. Generally to determine the optimal order of quantity of a particular item of inventory to be purchased at a particular time, which gives maximum economy to an entrepreneur, is called “EOQ”.
          <br/>
          It is calculated on the basis of the given formula:
          <br/>
          \(EOQ=\sqrt { 2DP/C } \)
          <br/>
          Where D= the annual usage (or demand) of the item in units P = the cost of place on order C = inventory carrying cost per unit (This may be derived by multiplying the unit price of the item by carrying cost expressed as % of the unit price.)
          <br/>
          The above formula minimizes the total cost of managing inventory consisting of ordering cost and carrying cost of inventory. The two costs are inversely related, when the one increases the : other decreases with the change in the purchase quantity of inventory. It is a balance between the two opposing cost-carrying cost and order processing cost, can be achieved by computing the economic order quantity.
         </p>
<p>
<span style="color: #993366;">
<strong>
            Question 3. Give the formula of EOQ and write down its assumptions.

</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
</span>
          \(EOQ=\sqrt { 2DP/C } \)
          <br/>
          where D = the annual usage (or demand)
          <br/>
          of the item in units
          <br/>
          P = the cost of place on order
          <br/>
          C = annual carrying cost per unit
          <br/>
          The above formula is based on following assumptions:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           Ordering cost is constant i.e. it is independent of size of the order.
          </li>
<li>
           The cost of carrying additional inventory is constant.
          </li>
<li>
           There are no quantity and discounts available.

<strong>
            Answer.

</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
</span>
          A firm maintains several types of inventories. To control them properly the firm adopts a selective approach which is called ABC Analysis. In this the firm classifies all items according to values so that the most valuable items may be paid highly, more attention is given regarding their safety and care as compared to other items. It has been observed that out of a long list of inventory,
          <br/>
          A category list are small in number say 5-10 per cent of the total value but they are quite valuable of total value. The value being 70-75 per cent of the total value of stocks.
          <br/>
          B category is in between A and C categories having 15 to 20 per cent of the number of items and 15 to 20% of the total value.
          <br/>
          C category items are 70-75% in numbers but carrying little value ranging from 5-10%.
          <br/>
          We can see following categorization:

<br/>
          The above three categories vary from product to product and organization to organization. Great care and control is to be exercised on items of “A” list, as any loss or breakage or wastage of any item of this list may prove to be very costly, proper care is to be taken on “B” list items and comparative list control is needed for “C” list items.

<strong>
            Question 6. What do you mean by Break Even Point? Explain its importance.
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
</span>
          Break even point is a neutral point at which the company neither makes a profit nor suffers a loss. Calculating the break¬even point is a powerful quantitative tool for managers.
          <br/>
          In its simplest form, break even analysis provides insight into whether or not revenue from a product or service has the ability to cover the relevant costs of production of that product or service. Entrepreneurs can use this information in making a wide range of business decisions, including setting prices, preparing competitive bids, and applying for loans. It also helps in profit planning and goal setting.
          <br/>
          At the break even level,
          <br/>
          Total Revenue = Total Expenses The formula for calculating break even level is:
          <br/>
          Break Even Volume=Fixed cost/Gross margin
          <br/>
          Gross Margin Per Unit = Unit Price (Selling price) – Marginal Cost (Variable cost)
          <br/>
          Contribution per unit = Selling price per unit – Variable cost per unit Or
          <br/>
          Contribution Ratio = Selling price – Marginal cost
          <br/>
          Marginal Cost = Total variable cost Or = Total cost — Fixed cost
          <br/>
          Or = Direct material+Direct
          <br/>
          labour + Direct expenses + Variable overhead
          <br/>
          The ‘Break-even Point’ is that volume of sales at which total revenue is equal to total costs, with zero profit. ‘Break-even point’ is a situation where the firm is neither in profit nor loss. In other words, this is a ‘no-profit, no-loss situation’. When the organisation is not able to earn profits, the best alternative for the firm is, at least, not to incur loss. So, organisation would like to know at what level of production and sales, the organisation would be able to achieve no-loss, no-profit situation. This is the greatest contribution of ‘Break-even Point’.

<strong>
           Advantages of Cost Plus method of pricing:
          </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
            Easy:
           </strong>
           This method of pricing is very simple method. It can easily be used for determining the price.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Flexible:
           </strong>
           Any changes in the cost of production or the margin of profit change the price in the same direction. It automatically gets adjusted to the change.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Visible profit margin:
           </strong>
           Profit margin is not to be calculated. It is already fixed. Thus by multiplying the profit per unit with the volume of the product, the total profit can be determined.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Increases efficiency:
           </strong>
           Any upward rise in cost is easily visible. This provides an idea to the entrepreneur to adjust his production for keeping the cost as low as possible.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Less calculation:
           </strong>
           Comparatively less calculations are involved. Which makes the implementation of this method simple,

<strong>
           Features of Co-operative societies:
          </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
            Democratic management:
           </strong>
           The management of a co-operative organisation is vested in the hands of the managing committee elected by the members on the basis of ’one member-one vote’. Democracy is, thus, the keynote of the management of a co-operative society.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Capital and return thereon:
           </strong>
           The capital is procured from its members in the form of share capital. A member can subscribe subject to a maximum of 10% of the total share capital or Rs 1,000 whichever is higher. Shares cannot be transferred but surrendered to the organisation. The rate of dividends paid to the members/ shareholders is restricted to 9% as per the Co-operative Societies Act, 1912.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Distribution of surplus:
           </strong>
           After giving dividends to the members, the surplus of profits, if any, is distributed among the members on the basis of goods purchased by each member from the society.

            Question 3. Why there is a need for cash flow projection?
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
</span>
          The following are the need of cash flow projection:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           Every business must want to manage its affairs in a very efficient manner.
          </li>
<li>
           It means it must pay its suppliers as per agreed terms, pay the employees their wages on stipulated dates, pay government levies, etc. as per rules, procure services and pay for the same, pay utility bills and rent etc., on time.
          </li>
<li>
           It must collect what is due to it also in a timely manner and should strive to sell more so it can collect more.
          </li>
<li>
           Very often, when business is expanding, your outflows can be more than in your inflows. This is so because there is always a lag between your spending (on raw materials, labour, etc.) and your receiving the sales revenue.
          </li>
<li>
           Receipt of sales revenue may be delayed because you might have given credit or you have produced ahead of the sales (to cater to the high demand during festive season) and are temporarily holding finished goods stock.
          </li>
<li>
           In such situations, you should be equipped with sufficient information to be able to arrange for needed funds.
          </li>
<li>
           The nature of any business is uncertainty. You base your calculations on certain (hopefully realistic) assumptions.
          </li>
<li>
           It plans the funds required using these assumptions. ‘
          </li>
<li>
           However, your actual performance, say of sales, could be higher or lower than your plan. It will rarely be exactly per plan.
          </li>
<li>
           Or your collection from credit customers has lagged and you are running short of funds. There could be many other reasons as to why your well laid out funding plan has gone for a loss,
          </li>
<li>
           To avoid such situations and be on top of things, reviewing your projections periodically and recasting the future based on the current status (and not assumptions of the past) and what is likely to happen in the near future is very crucial.
          </li>
<li>
           Cash flow projections is not a static document. It must be used as a dynamic tool.
          </li>

<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
</span>
          Break -even analysis is a technique widely used in the manufacturing unit by the production manager It is based on categorising production costs between two types of cost:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           Fixed cost
          </li>
<li>
           Variable cost
          </li>
</ol>
<p>

<br/>
          From the above two examples we can understand that unit price of single product is comparatively higher than the unit price of a multiple product.
          <br/>
          Businesses dealing with multiple products must reduce all the selling prices down to one selling price and bring down to one variable cost. This is accomplished by calculating a weighted average selling price and a weighted average product cost (variable cost). Further, when the weighted average selling price and weighted average variable cost are calculated, only then can a business, selling multiple products, determine their break-even point. Moreover, businesses selling multiple products will determine their break-even point using the following Break Even formula:
          <br/>
          Break-even point =Fixed Costs/Weighted Average Selling Price – Weighted Average Variable Costs
          <br/>
          As you can see, the break-even point formula for businesses selling multiple products is similar to the formula used by businesses selling a single product. The only difference is the term “weighted average” placed in front of the selling price and variable cost. It is important to understand the concept of weighted averages.
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           Calculating the break-even point (through break-even analysis) can provide a simple, yet powerful quantitative tool for managers.
          </li>
<li>
           The analysis provides insight into whether or not revenue from a product or service has the ability to cover the relevant costs of production of that product or service.
          </li>
<li>
           Entrepreneurs can use this information in making a wide range of business decisions, including setting prices, preparing competitive bids, and applying for loans.
          </li>
<li>
           It also helps in profit planning and goal setting.

<strong>
            Question 2. Explain the factors determining the working capital requirements.
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
</span>
          Following factors determine the working capital requirements:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
            Turn over:
           </strong>
           Higher is the sales turn over, lower is the requirement of working capital. The revenue is obtained from the current assets. On the other hand, lower is the sales turn over; higher is the requirement of working capital.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Tax liability:
           </strong>
           Increase in the tax liability increases the requirement of working capital and decrease in the tax liability of the enterprise decreases the need of working capital.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Size of enterprise:
           </strong>
           Larger is the size of enterprise; larger is the requirement of working capital. On the contrary, smaller is the size of enterprise; smaller is the requirement of working capital.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Nature of the enterprise:
           </strong>
           Requirement of working capital is different type of enterprises. Restaurants, hotels, etc. have less working capital requirements due to cash sales. Enterprise producing heavy machines needs more working capital, as their operating cycle is longer.
           <br/>
<strong>
            (a) Operating cycle:
           </strong>
           Longer is the length of operating cycle larger is the requirement of working capital. This is due to the fact that more money is needed for making stocks, purchasing raw materials, etc.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Stock of inventory:
           </strong>
           If the enterprise prefers to make a larger stock of finished, semi-finished goods and raw materials, the requirement of working capital also matters. On the other hand, lesser is the stock of such materials, lesser is the requirement of working capital.
          </li>
</ol>

           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
</span>
          Pilferage of material means – theft. In any enterprises or a business theft raises your costs, lowers your profits, makes you less competitive and affects morale.

<ol>
<li>
           Install adequate inventory and control measures to account for all material, supplies and equipment.
          </li>
<li>
           One control method is the requirement, register and signing for all tools and equipment to be issued by individuals.
          </li>
<li>
           Identify all tools and equipment by some mark or code.
          </li>
<li>
           Conduct a meeting in the form of workshop to convince and educate the employees that they have much more to lose than gain by stealing.
          </li>
<li>
           Make them understand and realize all employees that pilferage is morally wrong no matter how insignificant the value of the item taken.

</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>

</span>
          Financial management is needed because of the following:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
            To protect against unforeseen circumstances:
           </strong>
           Entrepreneur minimizes the risks by making a estimate of risks. For this purpose, he prefers to manage his money (finance) by keeping in mind its requirement in the future.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            To maximise profit:
           </strong>
           By managing the finance effectively, the entrepreneur tries to maximize his profit. Finance like other resources is available in limited quantity. Efficient utilization of finance is the only way for profit maximization.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            To acquire assets:
           </strong>
           Any type of asset whether tangible or intangible, need finance for acquiring them. As the enterprise grows, develops or diversifies, the requirement of finance also increases. Thus more is the finance available, more are the chances of acquiring new assets. Moreover from the present income the provision is to make for meeting future obligations. This needs proper management of finance.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            To maximise wealth:
           </strong>
           As the profit increases the wealth of the entrepreneur and the enterprise both are maximized. Goal of wealth maximization is realized by entrepreneur by making optimum utilization of resources, by maintaining the faith of the shares, by properly utilizing the undistributed profit etc.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            To ensure ready availability of funds:
           </strong>
           The flow of funds must take place as and when needed. At any point of time the shortage of funds is undesirable for the growth of enterprise.
          </li>
<li>

</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
</span>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
           For start up entrepreneurs, a budget is like a road map that can help them set goals and assess the validity of their business concept.
          </li>
<li>
           For established small businesses, a budget can be used to take the pulse of the business, determining how the business is performing through the years, and helping identify possible future investments.
          </li>
<li>
           By regularly consulting a budget, business leaders can compare actual figures and catch potential business shortfalls or other problems early. Budgets can also be instrumental in winning over investors, convincing banks your business is a good loan risk, or bringing on new partners or customers.
          </li>
<li>
           The single-most potential benefit of formal budgeting lies in ensuring that responsible managers take time each year (and then at fixed intervals throughout the year) in thinking about their operation by looking at all of its aspects. Budgeting creates a comprehensive picture of the future and makes both opportunities and barriers conscious. This foreknowledge then helps guide day-to-day activities.

            Question 8. Explain the concept of ABC Analysis.
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
</span>
          The ABC approach states that a company should rate items from A to C, basing its ratings on the following rules:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
           A-items are goods which annual consumption value is the highest; the top 70-80% of the annual consumption value of the company typically accounts for only 10-20% of total inventory items.
          </li>
<li>
           B-items are the inter class items, with a medium consumption value; those 15-25% of annual consumption value typically accounts for 30% of total inventory items.
          </li>
<li>
           C-items are, on the contrary, items with the lowest consumption value; the lower 5% of the annual consumption value typically accounts for 50% of total inventory items.
          </li>
</ol>
<p>
          Through this categorization, the supply manager can identify inventory which is more important and more profitable, and separate them from the rest of the items, especially those that are numerous but not that profitable.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Steps involved in ABC Analysis:
          </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
           Find out the unit cost and the usage of each material over a given period.
          </li>
<li>
           For each item calculate the total cost = Annual demand x Item cost per unit
          </li>
<li>
           Arrange all items in a progressively decreasing order of the cost (descending value).
          </li>
<li>
           Calculate and tabulate the cumulative total cost.

            Question 9. Explain the concepts of working capital with the help of an example.
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
</span>
          Concept of Working Capital: Generally, there are two concepts of working capital i.e. gross concept and net concept.
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
            Gross Concept of Working Capital:
           </strong>
           According to gross concept, working capital refers to all the current assets and represents the amount of funds invested in current assets.
           <br/>
           (a) Thus, gross working capital is the capital invested in current assets. Current assets are those
           <br/>
           assets which can be converted into cash within the short-time period, (say for 12 months )
           <br/>
           (b) Gross working capital = Total current assets
           <br/>
           Gross working capital refers to the firm’s investment in current assets. Gross working capital represents total of current assets which includes cash in hand, cash at bank, inventory, prepaid expenses, bills receivable, etc.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Net Concept of Working Capital:
           </strong>
           According to the net concept, working capital is the excess of current assets over current liabilities. In other words, the difference between current assets and current liabilities is called net working capital.
           <br/>
           Net Working Capital = Current Assets – Current liabilities Net working capital is the difference of current assets and current liabilities.
           <br/>
           (a) Gross Working Capital = Total Current Assets
           <br/>
           (b) Net Working Capital/Funds/Net Current Assets = Current Assets — Current Liabilities
           <br/>
           Example: Working capital of Raja and Co. has the following items in its Balance Sheet: Stock – 50,000: Trade creditors — 32,000; Debtors – 75000; Cash – 1,00000 Dividend payable – 50,000; Tax – 44,000; Short term loan — 61,000; Short term investments – 76,000. Calculate gross and net working capital.
           <br/>
           Total Current Assets = Debtors + Stock + Cash + Short term investment = (Rs75000 + Rs 50,000 + Rs 1,00000 + Rs 76,000)
           <br/>
           = Rs 3,01,000.
           <br/>
           Total Current Liabilities =Sundry Creditors + Dividend Payable + Tax + Short Term loan = Rs 32,000 + Rs 50,000 + Rs 44,000 + Rs 61,000 = Rs 1,87,000.
           <br/>
           Gross Working Capital = Total Current Assets = Rs 3,01,000 Net Working Capital = Total Current Assets – Total Current Liabilities = Rs 3,01,000 – Rs 1,87,000 = Rs 1,14,000 Gross Working Capital = Rs3,01,000 Net Working Assets = Rs 1,14,000.

            Question 11. “For a good inventory control system, we need to take care of both physical and fiscal aspects.” Explain the nature of items that make up the inventory.
           </strong>
</span>

<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
</span>
          For a good inventory control system, we need to take care of both physical and fiscal aspects. But before we deal with those two, let us understand the nature of items that make up the inventory.
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
            Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) Code:
           </strong>
           Each and every item in the inventory is to be identified with a unique code which signifies certain aspects of the item.
           <br/>
           It can be colour, size, weight or any other characteristic that is of importance in its use. The SKU code can be a combination of alpha and numeric.
           <br/>
           SKU is the very basic unit for data collection and further manipulation for deriving meaningful statistics and decision-making. Bar Codes and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags ‘ are used in tracking etc. using SKU.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Motley crowd:
           </strong>
<br/>
           (a) We always refer to inventory in one monetary value in the accounting statement, behind it are myriad numbers of SKUs – that can be classified as Raw Materials, Packing Materials, Spare Parts, Semi Finished Goods (or WIP – Work In Progress), Finished Goods, Consumables, etc.
           <br/>
           (b) The SKU code should definitely help us identify which class the item belongs but not much else. The treatment for each class will have to be different, keeping in mind some of the factors identified here.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Space:
           </strong>
           Space requirement for all items will not be identical; neither will it have proportionate relationship with the cost of the item. There can be many bulky items with low value (For example, straw for use in paper mill) as well as high value items with low volume (For example, Diamonds).
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Value:
           </strong>
           Not all SKUs have same value.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Lead time:
           </strong>
<br/>
           (a) Lead time to manufacture or procure an item depends on many factors. Combined effect of these factors — like standard or special raw material, processing time, scheduling of machines, distance between source and user point etc. – makes up the lead time for an item.
           <br/>
           (b) It is not always the same for a given item; variability in different factors contributing to the total lead time can make the lead time vary.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Standard Made to order:
           </strong>
           Some of the items in the inventory could be commodity items – no significant differentiation and hence easy to substitute, or many suppliers produce to same specifications and hence easy to choose from.
           <br/>
           (a) Others may be specifically made to order and hence possibly limited sources to order from.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Seasonality of supply:
           </strong>
           If the item is an agricultural product (grains, vegetables, fruits, etc.), the supply would be seasonal. This can play a role in designing the inventory control system.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Demand neither uniform nor predictable:
           </strong>
<br/>
           (a) Demand for an item could be seasonal — weather, festival seasons, events, school opening, etc. can play a significant part in this.
           <br/>
           (b) In some cases it is easy to forecast-raw material for items produced to order; but in others not so easy – requirement of a spare part.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Shelf life:
           </strong>
<br/>
           (a) Items like vegetables, fruits, flowers and fish are perishable in nature. This calls for special storage conditions and equipments – cold storage, freezers, etc. These, have financial implications.
           <br/>
           (b) Some of the manufactured food or medicinal products have expiry dates— beyond which they are not fit for consumption. This imposes certain constraints on inventory management.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Safety aspects:
           </strong>
<br/>
           (a) Some of the items are hazardous in nature and special precautions have to be taken in their storage. Examples are — gasoline, other combustible items, some hazardous chemicals, etc.
           <br/>
           (b) In a factory manufacturing safety matches, phosphorous and potassium chlorate are not stored in the same or even adjoining areas, for fear of accidental mix up. In fact, even their path of delivery to the respective end use points do not cross.
          </li>
<li>
<strong>
            Obsolescence:
           </strong>
<br/>
           (a) Due to advancement in technology, certain items may not be used and their demand drops off. These are the various characteristics of SKUs that have to be kept in mind while designing inventory control systems – one size will not fit all.
           <br/>
           (b) Different (rules and guidelines) will have to be different for raw materials, consumables, spare parts, packing materials, etc.
          </li>
</ol>

            Question 12. Define budgetary control. State how “budgetary control” helps an entrepreneur?
           </strong>
</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: #008000;">
<strong>
            Answer.
           </strong>
