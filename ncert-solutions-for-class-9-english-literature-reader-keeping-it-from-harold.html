          (e) Why was Mrs. Bramble upset when she came to hear that Bill had decided not to fight?
          <br/>
          (f) Who was Jerry Fisher? What did he say to try and convince Bill to change his mind?
          <br/>
          (g) How did Harold come to know that his father was a boxer?
          <br/>
          (h) Why was Harold upset that his father had not told him about his true identity? Give two reasons.
          <br/>
          (i) Do you agree with Harold’s parents decision of hiding from him the fact that his father was a boxer? Why/Why not?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Harold didn’t like the manner in which Mrs. Bramble addressed her son. Nor did he relish the habit of his mother of referring to herself in the third person. She spoke as if she were addressing a baby. She would never use “I” but said, “Yes, mother will hear you, precious”. Now Harold was a young man of ten. He had already won the spelling and dictation prize to his credit. He felt bad about it.

          Question 8.
          <br/>
          Many people are of the opinion that violent, physical sports such as boxing, kick boxing and wrestling, to name a few should be banned while others think otherwise.
          <br/>
          Express your opinion on the topic by either writing in favour of banning these sports or against banning them. While writing, you should also include the rebuttal to your questions. Try not to go beyond 200 words.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
<strong>
           BANNING VIOLENT PHYSICAL SPORTS
          </strong>
<br/>
          Many people think that violent physical sports such as boxing, kick boxing, wrestling, bull-fighting, to name a few, should be banned. And they think rightly so. What’s the main aim of sports and games? Pleasure and entertainment. They provide us thrill or ‘excitement’. They lift our spirits. We feel more animated and alive. And the entertainment that sports and games provide us is the healthy and wholesome entertainment. On the other hand, violent physical sports such as boxing, kick boxing and bullfighting provide us a vulgar pleasure. It is violent and sadistic in nature. When we watch hockey, badminton or cricket we enjoy them. We appreciate Gavaskar for defence, Vivian Richards for attack and Sachin Tendulkar for style. Similarly, we adore Maradona or Pele not for their foul play or hitting the opponents but for their scoring abilities. Similarly, we admire Federer for his craftsmanship and Nadal for his power play in lawn-tennis. All these sports lift us physically, mentally as well as spiritually.

<strong>
           Reference To Context
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           Read the extracts given below and answer the questions that follow:
          </strong>
<br/>
          Question 1.
          <br/>
          It was a constant source of amazement to Mrs. Bramble that she should have brought such a
          <br/>
          prodigy as Harold into the world. Harold was so different from ordinary children, so devoted to his books, such a model of behaviour, so altogether admirable. (Page 29)
          <br/>
          (a) Who is a prodigy child?
          <br/>
          (b) Who was so proud of such a prodigy?
          <br/>
          (c) Find a word in the extract similar in meaning to ‘commendable’.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) A child with exceptional talents is called a prodigy child.
          <br/>
          (b) Mrs. Bramble, Harold’s mother.
          <br/>
          (c) Admirable.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 2.
          <br/>
          The only drawback was that his very ‘perfection’ had made necessary a series of evasions and even deliberate falsehoods on the part of herself and her husband, highly distasteful to both. They were lovers of truth, but they had realised that there are times when truth must be sacrificed. At any cost, the facts concerning Mr. Bramble’s profession must be kept from Harold.(Page 29)
          <br/>
          (a) What was the only drawback in Harold?
          <br/>
          (b) Who indulged in evasions and deliberate falsehoods?
          <br/>
          (c) What does the clause ‘Mr. Bramble’s profession must be kept from Harold’ mean?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) His very ‘perfection’ was his only drawback.
          <br/>
          (b) Harold’s parents indulged in evasions and deliberate falsehoods.
          <br/>
          (c) It means that his father was a professional boxer. This fact must be concealed from Harold.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 3.
          <br/>
          Certainly he was very persuasive. Mr. Bramble had fallen in with the suggestion without demur. In private life he was the mildest and most obliging of men, and always yielded to everybody. The very naming of Harold had caused as sacrifice on his part. (Page 30)
          <br/>
          (a) ‘He’ here stands for whom?
          <br/>
          (b) What does the phrase ‘without demur’ mean here?
          <br/>
          (c) Who had to sacrifice in the naming of Harold?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Major Percy Stokes.
          <br/>
          (b) Without reluctance or objection.
          <br/>
          (c) Mr. Bramble had to sacrifice in the naming of Harold.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 4.
          <br/>
          So, Harold grew in stature and intelligence, without a suspicion of the real identity of the
          <br/>
          square-jawed man with the irregularly-shaped nose who came and went mysteriously in their semi-detached, red-brick home. He was a self-centred child, and, accepting the commercial traveller fiction, dismissed the subject from his mind and busied himself with things of more moment. (Page 31)
          <br/>
          (a) Who kept the identity of the square-jawed from Harold?
          <br/>
          (b) Who was ‘the square-jawed man’?
          <br/>
          (c) What was Harold told about his father?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Harold’s parents and Major Percy Stokes kept the identity of the square-jawed from Harold.
          <br/>
          (b) Mr. Bramble was ‘the square jawed man’.
          <br/>
          (c) He was told that his father was a commercial traveller.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 5.
          <br/>
          “Percy, if you don’t keep quiet, I’ll forget I’m your sister and let you have one. What do you mean, Bill, you’ve come home? Isn’t there going to be the fight next week, after all?” {Page 33)
          <br/>
          (a) Who is snubbing Percy?
          <br/>
          (b) Why has Bill dropped the idea of fighting?
          <br/>
          (c) Name the chapter in which these lines occur.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Mrs. Bramble is snubbing Percy.
          <br/>
          (b) He is afraid of his publicity.
          <br/>
          (c) ‘Keeping It From Harold.’
         </p>
<p>
          Question 6.
          <br/>
          “How about the money?” Repeated Mrs. Bramble. “Goodness knows I’ve never liked your profession, Bill, but there is this to be said for it, that it’s earned you good money and made it possible for us to give Harold as good an education as any duke ever had, I’m sure. (Page 33)
          <br/>
          (a) What is Bill’s profession?
          <br/>
          (b) What gave good money to the Brambles?
          <br/>
          (c) Write the verb form of ‘education’.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Professional boxing is Bill’s profession.
          <br/>
          (b) Bill’s professional boxing gave good money to the Brambles.
          <br/>
          (c) Educate.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 7.
          <br/>
          “Tommy,” said Mr. Fisher, ignoring them all, “you think your Pa’s a commercial. He ain’t. He’s a fighting-man, doing his eight-stone-four ringside, and known to all the heads as ‘Young Porky.’” (Page 37)
          <br/>
          (a) Who was Mr. Fisher?
          <br/>
          (b) Whom did Mr. Fisher address?
          <br/>
          (c) What does ‘ain’t’ stand for here? What else does it stand for?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Mr. Fisher was a boxing coach or trainer.
          <br/>
          (b) Mr. Fisher addressed Harold.
          <br/>
          (c) Here ‘ain’t’ stands for ‘is not’. It also stands for ‘am not’ and ‘are not’.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 8.
          <br/>
          How long do you suppose they’d go on calling me, ‘Goggles’ if they knew that you were my father? They’d chuck it tomorrow, and look up to me like anything, I do call ilrotten. (Page 38)
          <br/>
          (a) Who does the word ‘they’ here refer to?
          <br/>
          (b) Who is the speaker here?
          <br/>
          (c) What is ‘rotten’ in the eyes of the speaker?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Harold’s schoolmates.
          <br/>
          (b) Harold is the speaker.
          <br/>
          (c) Bill’s idea of withdrawing from the contest is ‘rotten’ in the eyes of the speaker.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 9.
          <br/>
          Pa, can’t you give me a picture of yourself boxing? I could swank like anything. And you don’t know how sick a chap gets of having chaps call him, ‘Goggles.’ (Page 38)
          <br/>
          (a) The speaker wants to swank. Why?
          <br/>
          (b) Why does the speaker feel sick?
          <br/>
          (c) Find a word in the extract similar in meaning to ‘man’.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (a) Harold wants to swank as he is the son of a famous boxer ‘Young Porky’.
          <br/>
          (b) Harold feels sick because he is called ‘Goggles’ by his classmates.
          <br/>
          (c) Chap.
         </p>
<p>

<strong>
           (i) Mr Bramble
           <br/>
</strong>
          Mr Bramble is a short, sturdy fellow. He is a red-headed man with a broken nose such as boxers generally have. He is thirty-one. He has a long record for respectability and sobriety. He is a famous boxer known as ‘Young Porky’. He is proud of the intellectual abilities of his son Harold. He comes to wrongly believe that Harold will hate him if he comes to know that he is a boxer. Though physically strong, he seems to be mentally weak.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           (ii) Mrs Bramble
           <br/>
</strong>
          Like all mothers, Mrs Bramble is excessively fond of her son, Harold. She is very loving and caring. She addresses her son as ‘dearie’ and refers to herself in the third person. She is also convinced that Harold should not know that his father is a boxer. She is a good housewife. She manages the house well. She feels upset when she learns that her husband has refused to fight. She feels that if he does not fight they will have no money essential for their son’s education and bright future.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           (iii) Harold
           <br/>
</strong>
          Harold is a model child, different from ordinary children. He is fully devoted to his books. He is a model of good behaviour. Everybody admires him. He has already won prizes in academics. His parents are in awe of him. His parents are unaware of the fact that he is interested in boxing and knows a lot about the game and boxers. He surprises his parents by expressing his anger that he has not been told that his father is a famous boxer. He proves them wrong. He feels proud of his father and his profession. He wants his father to fight and defeat his opponent, Murphy.

</strong>
<br/>
          Harold was a model child, different from ordinary children. He was fully devoted to his books. He was a model of good behaviour. But his ‘perfection’ was marred by deliberate falsehood on the part of his parents. His parents evaded the truth and lied to him about his father’s profession.

</strong>
<br/>
          Harold’s parents thought that boxing did not enjoy good reputation, and that being a professional boxer was not something to be proud of. They feared their child would feel ashamed of himself if he learnt that his father was a boxer.

</strong>
<br/>
          The senior curate of the parish and Mrs Bramble’s brother, Major Percy Stokes, were mainly responsible for convincing Harold’s parents not to disclose the true identity of his father to him as they believed that boxing was not a respectable profession.

</strong>
<br/>
          Mr Bramble had been proud of being a professional boxer before the birth of Harold. He was the most obliging of men. When he was asked to suppress his profession for the better development of his child, he agreed to the suggestion without demur.

           </span>
</strong>
<br/>
          You should really take pride in your profession. Only then can others give you respect and recognition. Those who look down upon their profession remain guilt-ridden and a failure. In the story ‘Keeping It from Harold’ both Mrs and Mr Bramble are guilty of undermining the profession of boxing. Mr Bramble is a famous boxer, known as “Young Porky’. Uptil his son’s birth he thinks high of his profession. Then both he and his wife come to believe that their son Harold would feel embarrassed and ashamed of the fact that he was the son of a boxer. They keep Mr Bramble’s profession a secret from Harold. They are pleasantly shocked when Harold feels angry at being deprived of the glory and honour of being a famous boxer’s son. This proves that his parents were not justified in downgrading a good profession. Boxing, though an aggressive and bloody game, is an honourable profession like any other profession.

           </span>
</strong>
<br/>
          Harold is an intelligent boy who is considered to be a model in studies and behaviour. Everyone at school praises him. He has already won some prizes in academics. He is a bespectacled child. His parents are in a bit of awe of him. His mother, Mrs Bramble, calls him ‘dearie’ and looks upon him as a child prodigy. His father is equally fond and proud of him. His parents come to believe that he should not know that he is the son of a professional boxer. He can never think that he could be a lover of boxing and boxers. When Harold learns about his being the son of a famous boxer, he feels angry of being deprived of glory and honour. He tells his parents that if the fact was known to his school children they would never have dared to make fun of him by calling ‘Goggles’. His interest in games, especially boxing, shows that is much maturer than his parents can ever think of.

</strong>
<br/>
          The Brambles had not told their son Harold that his father was a professional boxer. They were afraid that Harold would feel bad and bitter about the truth. So they told a lie to him that his father was a firm’s touring representative. Mr Bramble wanted to take part for the last time in a boxing match. He went for training with Jerry Fisher. When he learnt that the match would be reported in the Mail with his photograph he got frightened. He thought that their secret would be out. So he withdrew himself from the training. As they needed money, the matter caused both he and his wife a lot of worry and tension. Jerry Fisher, in anger, revealed their secret to their son Harold. When Harold announced his itnerest in boxing and his feelings of pride in being the son of a boxer, Mr and Mrs Bramble were relieved of their burden and guilt. Thus, Jerry Fisher, in revealing the secret, helped them regain normalcy.

I would not believe my ears. Dad and a boxer ? I had been told that he was a touring representative of a firm, My father was ready to sacrifice name and fame and money just for my so-called dignity. I appreciate his feelings. At the same time I feel sad that I have been deprived of the honour and glory of being the son of a great boxer. I have asked Dad to give me his photograph to swank it before my friends ever ready to make fun of me as ‘Goggles’. I have also asked Dad to fight and beat Murphy. I want him to win the bout at all costs. How I love you, Dad!

          Dear John
          <br/>
          I wish I were dead this moment. You know, I am deadly against boxing which is a Devil’s game. Boxing is simply inhuman. I believe boxers are fated to go to Hell. I did my best to save Mr Bramble, my sister’s husband, from perdition. I was happy when Mr Bramble came back home deciding not to participate in the bout with Jimmy Murphy. My sister resented his coming home. I tried to persuade her to see reason and forget the money involved. Then Jerry Fisher-Mr Bramble’s trainer-undid all that I had done. He told the secret to Harold, and Harold-God save him-was so exultant on knowing that he was the son of a boxer! How mean on his part.
          <br/>
          I’ve decided never to step in the house of those Brambles.
          <br/>
          Yours sincerely Percy

            Question 6:
           </span>
</strong>
<br/>
          ‘Keeping It from Harold’ underlines the idea that boxing is as dignified as any other activity, physical or mental. What happens when we downplay one activity over the other, especially our own ability ? What should be our attitude ?
          <br/>
<strong style="color: green; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
<span style="color: #008000;">
            Answer:
           </span>
</strong>
<br/>
          Mr Bramble, a famous boxer, hides his profession from his intellectually brilliant son, fearing that he might come to hate him. He decides to stop boxing.
          <br/>
          We feel that when we downplay one activity over the other illogically, we are not doing something fair. If we happen to downplay and dislike our own ability, like Mr Bramble, we are likely to fall in our own eyes. We lose our self-confidence and self-pride. Others may or may not despise us but we begin to despise ourselves. The Brambles are surprised when their son says that he would have loved to be known as the son of a famous boxer.
          <br/>
          Therefore, we need to be proud of our own achievements. We should be proud of whatever profession we are in. We should try to excel in it and feel proud of what we do. Only then will other people love and respect us. We should remember that no activity or profession is undignified or low. It is our thinking that makes something desirable or undesirable.

<br/>
          There are many people who look down upon boxing. They think that sports like boxing are violent and are hence not meant for gentle folk. In the story, such people are represented by the senior curate of the parish and major Percy Stokes who take upon them the responsibility of guarding the morality of the people. They persuade the Brambles to hide from their son Harold the profession of his father. Mr Bramble, who has been a good boxer and known as Young Porky’, comes to believe them. Being modest, he gives in to their demands. In spite of having pride in his profession, he agrees to hide his true identity. He makes this sacrifice for the sake of his son. He wants his son not to feel ashamed of himself for his being a boxer. It is again for the sake of his son that he decides not to take part in the contest with Jimmy Murphy, though he needs money badly. He fears his son will come to know of his father’s true identity as the event is going to be reported in the Mail.

<br/>
          Harold overheard his father talking about him. He was curious to know what he was talking about. Jerry Fisher, in order to take revenge on Bill, told Harold that his father was not a commercial traveler but the famous boxer ‘Young Porky’, and that his father was not going to fight with Murphy because of him. Harold was astonished to learn the fact. He surprised everyone by revealing that he had a bet and if there were no contest, he was going to lose his bet. He said that his friends had the autographs of famous sport spersons. He felt annoyed that he had been kept in the dark about his father being a boxer. Nobody would have laughed at him and called him ‘Goggles’ if they had known who his father was.
