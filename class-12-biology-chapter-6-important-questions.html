<p>
          Question 1.
          <br/>
          Write the dual purpose served by deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates in polymerisation. (2018)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Deoxyribonucleoside Triphosphates (dNTPs) serve the dual purpose of
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           acting as a substrate.
          </li>
<li>
           providing energy (from two terminal phosphates).
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          Question 2.
          <br/>
          Why does hnRNA undergo splicing? Where does splicing occur in the cell? (Delhi 2015C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          hnRNA undergoes splicing to remove non-coding sequences, i.e. introns and joins exons. Splicing occurs in the nucleus of the cell.

<p>
          Question 3.
          <br/>
          Name the enzyme that transcribes hnRNA in eukaryotes. (Delhi 2015C)
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          Write the function of RNA polymerase-II. (Foreign 2015)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The RNA polymerase-II transcribes the precursor of mRNA, i.e. the heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA).
         </p>
<p>
          Question 4.
          <br/>
          Why is RNA more reactive in comparison to DNA? (Delhi 2015C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The OH-group in the ribose of RNA at 3’end makes the molecule more reactive, compared with DNA. RNA is also not stable under alkaline conditions.

          Name the negatively charged and positively charged components of a nucleosome. (Delhi 2015C)
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          Name the positively charged protein around which the negatively charged DNA wrapped. (All India 2012C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Histone proteins forming an octamer is the positively charged component and the DNA helix is the negatively charged component of nucleosome.

          <br/>
          What is cistron? (All India 2015)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The segment of DNA coding for a polypeptide is known as cistron.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 7.
          <br/>
          Name the transcriptionally active region of chromatin in a nucleus. (Delhi 2015)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>

          Question 8.
          <br/>
          What will happen if DNA replication is not followed by cell division in a eukaryotic cell? (All India 2014C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          If cell division is not followed after DNA replication then replicated chromosomes (DNA) would not be distributed to daughter nuclei. A repeated replication of DNA without any cell division results in the accumulation of DNA inside the cell.
          <br/>
          This would increase the volume of the cell nucleus, thereby causing cell expansion. Further, it will lead to polyploidy.

          Question 9.
          <br/>
          Why is it not possible for an alien DNA to become part of chromosome anywhere along its length and replicate normally? (All India 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          An alien DNA cannot become a part of chromosome anywhere along its length and replicate normally due to the absence of origin of replication where the replication process is initiated.

          <br/>
          If the base adenine constitutes 31% of an isolated DNA fragment, then what is the expected percentage of the base cytosine in it? (Delhi 2011c)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          According to Chargaff’s rule A + G = C+ T = 50%
          <br/>
          ∴ if A = 31% then T = 31%;
          <br/>
          C + T = 50%

          Question 19.
          <br/>
          What is an origin of replication in a chromosome? State its function. (Delhi 2019)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Replication does not initiate randomly at any place in DNA (chromosome). So, there is a definite region in DNA (chromosome) termed as origin of replication. It is the place from where DNA replication originates. It helps in propagation of a piece of DNA, during recombinant DNA procedures.

          Question 20.
          <br/>
          Although a prokaryotic cell has no defined nucleus, yet DNA is not scattered throughout the cell. Explain. (2018)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Prokaryotes lack a defined nucleus. However, the DNA is not scattered throughout the cell. This is due to the fact that the negatively charged DNA is held with some positively charged proteins in nucleoid or the middle region. In this region, the DNA is organised in large loops held by proteins.

          <br/>
          How do histones acquire positive charge? Delhi 2011
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Nucleosome is a complex of negatively charged DNA. wrapped around the positively charged histone octamer (unit of 8 molecules of histone). It is found in the nucleus of the cell.
          <br/>
          It is made up of four types of proteins; H
          <sub>
           2
          </sub>
          A, H
          <sub>
           2

          and H
          <sub>
           4
          </sub>
          occurring in pairs. The histone proteins acquire positive charge due to abundance of amino acid residues, i.e. lysine and arginines. Both these amino acids carry positive charges in their side chains. A typical nucleosome consists of 200 base pairs of DNA helix.

          Question 36.
          <br/>
          Explain the mechanism of DNA replication with the help of a replication fork. What role does the enzyme DNA-ligase play in a replication fork? (Delhi 2019)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Replication in DNA strand occurs within a small opening of the DNA helix, known as replication fork.
          <br/>
          For figure, see Answer No. 26.
          <br/>
          DNA polymerases catalyse polymerisation only in one direction, i.e. 5′ → 3′. It creates additional complications at the replicating fork. Consequently, on one strand (template 3′ → 5′), the replication is continuous. This is known as leading strand, while on the other strand (template 5′ → 3′), it is discontinuous. This is known as lagging strand.
          <br/>
          The discontinuously synthesised fragments called Okazaki fragments are later joined by DNA ligase.

<br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The process of copying genetic information from one strand of DNA into RNA is called ‘transcription’. Transcription is catalysed by ‘DNA dependent RNA polymerase’.

          Question 38.
          <br/>
          Why is DNA molecule considered as a better hereditary material than RNA molecule? (2018C)
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          Why is DNA a bettter genetic material when compared to RNA? (Delhi 2015C)
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          Why is DNA considered a better hereditary material than RNA? (Foreign 2012)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          DNA is considered a better genetic material when compared to RNA because of its high stability and low reactivity. RNA being more reactive, is labile and easily degradable.
          <br/>
          The high reactivity of RNA is contributed by the 2-OH group in the nucleotides. RNA as a catalyst (e.g. ribozyme) is also more reactive. Uracil present in RNA makes it unstable over DNA that contains thymine.

          How was a heavy isotope of nitrogen used to provide experimental evidence to semi-conservative mode of DNA replication? (Foreign 2015)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl conducted an experiment with Escherichia coli (1958) as follows
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           They grew many generations of E. coli in a medium that contained
           <sup>
            15
           </sup>
           NH
           <sub>
            4
           </sub>
           Cl (
           <sup>
            15
           </sup>
           N is the heavy isotope of nitrogen) as the only source of nitrogen. The result was that
           <sup>
            15
           </sup>
           N was incorporated into the newly synthesised DNA. Upon centrifugation in a cesium chloride (CsCl) density gradient, this heavy DNA molecule could be distinguished from the normal DNA.
          </li>
<li>
           The cells were then transferred into a medium containing normal
           <sup>
            14
           </sup>
           NH

            4
           </sub>
           Cl.
          </li>
<li>
           At definite time intervals, as the cells multiplied, samples were taken and the DNA which remained as double-stranded helices were extracted.
          </li>
<li>
           The samples were separated independently on CsCl gradient to measure the densities of DNA.
          </li>
<li>
           The DNA obtained from the culture, one generation after the transfer from
           <sup>
            15
           </sup>
           N to
           <sup>
            14
           </sup>
           N medium had a hybrid or intermediate density.
          </li>
<li>
           The DNA obtained from the culture after another generation (generation II), was composed of equal amounts of hybrid DNA and Tight’ DNA.

<p>
          Thus, Meselson and Stahl concluded that the DNA replication is semi-conservative, i.e. out of the two strands of DNA one is the parental

          <br/>
          (ii) Draw a diagrammatic sketch of a portion of DNA segment to support your answer. (Delhi 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) According to Chargaff’s rule, ratio of purines to pyrimidines is equal,
          <br/>
          i.e. A + G = C + T
          <br/>
          The number of adenine (A) is equal to the number of thymine (T).
          <br/>
          A = 240(given)
          <br/>
          Therefore, T = 240
          <br/>
          Also, the number of guanine (G) is equal to cytosine (C).
          <br/>
          Thus, G + C = 1000 – [A + T]
          <br/>
          G + C = 1000 – 480= 520
          <br/>
          Hence, G = 260, C = 260
          <br/>
          The number of pyrimidine bases,
          <br/>
          i.e. C + T= 240 + 260 = 500
         </p>

<br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          (i) Given, G = 410 therefore, C = 410
          <br/>
          A + T = 1500 – (G + C)
          <br/>
          = 1500 – 820 = 680
          <br/>
          Hence, A = 340; T = 340
          <br/>
          The number of pyrimidine bases, i.e.
          <br/>
          C + T = 410 + 340 = 750
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Refer to above figure.
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          (i) Given, A = 520
          <br/>
          therefore, T = 520
          <br/>
          A + T = 520 + 520 = 1040
          <br/>
          Total number of nucleotides = 2000
          <br/>
          G + C = 2000 – 1040 = 960
          <br/>
          G = 960/2 = 450
          <br/>
          Hence, total number of purine bases are
          <br/>
          ⇒ A + G = 520 + 480 = 1000
          <br/>
          (ii) Refer to above figure.

<br/>
          The promoter and terminator flank the structural gene in a transcription unit. The promoter is located towards 5’end (upstream) of the structural gene and it helps to initiate transcription by binding with RNA polymerase. The terminator is located toward 3’end (downstream) of the coding strand and it usually defines the end of the process of transcription. The structural gene is present in between promoter and terminator. It codes for enzyme or protein for structural functions.

          Question 49.
          <br/>
          List the salient features of double helix structure of DNA. (All India 2012)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Salient features of DNA double helix are as follows
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           It is made up of two polynucleotide chains containing the backbone of sugar-phosphate from which the bases project inside.
          </li>
<li>
           The two chains have anti-parallel polarity, i.e. one of them is 5′ → 3′, the other has 3′ → 5’polarity.
          </li>
<li>
           The bases in two strands are paired through hydrogen bond (H-bonds) forming base pairs (bp). Adenine pairs through two hydrogen bonds with thymine on opposite strand and vice-versa. In the same way, guanine is bonded with cytosine through three H-bonds. Due to which, purine always comes opposite to a pyrimidine.
          </li>
<li>
           The two chains are coiled in a right-handed fashion. The pitch of the helix is 3.4 nm and there are roughly 10 bp in each turn. Consequently, the distance between base pair in a helix is about 0.34 nm.
          </li>
<li>
           The plane of one base pair stacks over the other in double helix. This confers stability to the helical structure.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          Question 50.
          <br/>
          How is hnRNA processed to form mRNA? (Foreign 2012)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The precursor of mRNA transcribed by RNA polymerase-II is called heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA). It undergoes following processing to form nascent wRNA.
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Splicing In this process, the non-coding introns are removed and coding sequences called exons are joined in a definite order. This is required because primary transcript contains both introns and exons.
          </li>
<li>
           Capping Refer to Answer No. 46.
          </li>
<li>
           Tailing Refer to Answer No. 46.
          </li>
<li>
           The fully processed mRNA is released from the nucleus into cytoplasm for translation.

          (i) Give the base sequence of the complementary strand.
          <br/>
          (ii) How are these base pairs held together in a DNA molecule?
          <br/>
          (iii) Explain the base complementarity rule. Name the scientist who framed this rule. (Delhi 2011)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) ATCGTACTA.
          <br/>
          (ii) Base pairs are held together by weak hydrogen bonds, adenine pairs with thymine by two H-bonds and guanine pairs with cytosine through three H-bonds.
          <br/>
          (iii) Base complementarity rule : For a double-stranded DNA, this rule states that the ratio between adenine and thymine and that between guanine and cytosine are constant and equal to one. Erwin Chargaff framed this rule.

<p>
          Question 52.
          <br/>
          Why do you see two different types of replicating Strands in the given DNA replication fork? Explain. Name these strands. (Delhi 2011)
          <br/>
<img alt="Molecular Basis of Inheritance Class 12 Important Questions and Answers Biology Chapter 6 Img 17" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-147401" height="170" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Molecular-Basis-of-Inheritance-Class-12-Important-Questions-and-Answers-Biology-Chapter-6-Img-17.png" width="159"/>
<br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Two different types of parent strands function as template strands.
          <br/>
          On the template strand with 3′ → 5’polarity, the new strand is synthesised as a continuous strand because the enzyme DNA polymerase can carry out polymerisation of the nucleotides only in 5′ → 3′ direction. This is called continuous synthesis and the strand is called leading strand.
         </p>
<p>
          On the template strand with 5′-» 3’polarity, the new strand is synthesised from the point of replication fork in short stretches called Okazaki fragments and this strand is called lagging strand. Okazaki fragments are later joined by DNA ligases to form a continuous strand.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 53.
          <br/>
          Monocistronic structural genes in eukaryotes have interrupted coding sequences. Explain. How are they different in prokaryotes? (Delhi 2011C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Monocistronic structural genes in eukaryotes have interrupted coding sequences due to the presence of introns, i.e. non-coding sequences.
         </p>
<p>
          Differences between monocistronic structural gene in prokaryotes and in eukaryotes are as follows

          Question 54.
          <br/>
          Explain the role of 35S and 32P in the experiments conducted by Hershey and Chase. (All India 2010C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Hershey and Chase used
          <sup>
           35
          </sup>
          S and
          <sup>
           32
          </sup>
          P in their culture medium. These are radioactive sulphur and phosphorus, respectively. These two components were used to detect whether the genetic material is DNA or protein.
         </p>
<p>
          Role of
          <sup>
           32
          </sup>
          P and
          <sup>
           35

          S Viruses grown on medium with
          <sup>
           32
          </sup>
          S. had non-radioactive genetic material and radioactive protein as sulphur is not present in DNA but found in protein.
          <br/>
          While those grown on
          <sup>
           32
          </sup>
          P had radioactive genetic material because DNA contains phosphorus but proteins does not contain it. Thus, it was established that DNA is the genetic material.

          Question 55.
          <br/>
          Describe the initiation process of transcription in bacteria. (Delhi 2010)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Initiation process of transcription in bacteria RNA polymerase becomes associated transiently to an initiation factor sigma (cr) and binds to specific sequence on DNA called promoter to initiate transcription.
          <br/>
          A single DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyses the transcription of all the three types of RNA.

          Question 56.
          <br/>
          Describe the elongation process of transcription in bacteria. (Delhi 2010)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Elongation process of transcription in bacteria RNA polymerase facilitates opening of the DNA helix after binding to promoter. It uses ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrate and polymerises the nucleotides in a template dependent fashion following complementarity. The process continues till RNA polymerase reaches the terminator region on the DNA strand.

          Question 57.
          <br/>
          Describe the termination process of transcription in bacteria. (Delhi 2010)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Termination occurs when RNA polymerase reaches the terminator region and the nascent RNA falls off. The RNA polymerase being transiently associated with termination factor rho (p) also falls off the transcription unit.

          Question 59.
          <br/>
          Describe the role of RNA polymerases in transcription in bacteria and in eukaryotes. (Foreign 2010)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          In bacteria, there is a single DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which catalyses the formation of mRNA, tRNA and rRNA.
          <br/>
          In eukaryotes, there are three types of RNA polymerases, which show division of labour.
          <br/>
          These are as follows
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           RNA polymerase-I transcribes rRNAs, (28S, 18S and 5.8S)
          </li>
<li>
           RNA polymerase-II transcribes the precursor of mRNA called hnRNA.
          </li>
<li>
           RNA polymerase-III transcribes tRNA, 5 SrRNA and snRNAS.

          (ii) Explain, how the biochemical characterisation (nature) of ‘Transforming Principle’ was determined, which was not defined from Griffith’s experiments. (2018)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) Central Dogma It states that there is one way or unidirectional flow of information from master copy DNA to working copy RNA (transcription) and from working copy RNA to building plan of polypeptide chain (translation).
          <br/>

<br/>
          Central dogma of molecular biology was proposed by Crick (1958). It can also be written as follows
          <br/>
<img alt="Molecular Basis of Inheritance Class 12 Important Questions and Answers Biology Chapter 6 Img 23" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-147407" height="47" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Molecular-Basis-of-Inheritance-Class-12-Important-Questions-and-Answers-Biology-Chapter-6-Img-23.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Molecular-Basis-of-Inheritance-Class-12-Important-Questions-and-Answers-Biology-Chapter-6-Img-23.png 305w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Molecular-Basis-of-Inheritance-Class-12-Important-Questions-and-Answers-Biology-Chapter-6-Img-23-300x46.png 300w" width="305"/>
<br/>
          Exception Reverse transcription is an exception to central dogma. The discovery of ‘RNA dependent DNA polymerase’ gave the concept of central dogma reverse or teminism. It suggested that information flow can also take place from RNA to DNA.
          <br/>
<img alt="Molecular Basis of Inheritance Class 12 Important Questions and Answers Biology Chapter 6 Img 24" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-147408" height="40" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Molecular-Basis-of-Inheritance-Class-12-Important-Questions-and-Answers-Biology-Chapter-6-Img-24.png" width="292"/>
<br/>
          During this, transcription or RNA synthesis occurs over DNA and translation or protein synthesis occurs over ribosomes. In eukaryotes, these two processes are separated in time and space. This protects DNA from respiratory enzymes and RNA’s degradation from nucleases.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Various experiments were conducted to prove that DNA is the genetic material. Griffith did his experiment and concluded that some substance causes transformation. However, he did not tell the substance that had caused the transformation.
         </p>
<p>
          Biochemical Characterisation of Transforming Principle Three scientists Avery, MacLeod and McCarty revealed that the chemical nature of the transforming substance was DNA. They showed that DNA isolated from S-strain could itself confer the pathogenic properties to R-strain.
         </p>
<p>
          This fact suggested that DNA possesses the genetic properties.
          <br/>
          The outline of the experiment is given below
          <br/>
<img alt="Molecular Basis of Inheritance Class 12 Important Questions and Answers Biology Chapter 6 Img 25" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-147409" height="318" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 349px) 100vw, 349px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Molecular-Basis-of-Inheritance-Class-12-Important-Questions-and-Answers-Biology-Chapter-6-Img-25.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Molecular-Basis-of-Inheritance-Class-12-Important-Questions-and-Answers-Biology-Chapter-6-Img-25.png 349w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Molecular-Basis-of-Inheritance-Class-12-Important-Questions-and-Answers-Biology-Chapter-6-Img-25-300x273.png 300w" width="349"/>
</p>
<p>
          Thus, on the basis of their experiment, they concluded that DNA is the hereditary material.

          Question 61.
          <br/>
          (i) Why does DNA replication occur in small replication forks and not in its entire length?
          <br/>
          (ii) Why is DNA replication continuous and discontinuous in a replication fork?
          <br/>
          (iii) State the importance of origin of replication in a replication fork. (2018C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) DNA replication occurs in small replication fork and not in its entire length because whole DNA cannot be opened in one stretch due to high energy requirement.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) DNA replication is continuous and discontinuous in a replication fork because the enzyme DNA polymerase can carry out polymerisation of the nucleotides only in 5-3′ direction. On the template strand with 3-5′ polarity, DNA replication is continuous. On the template strand with polarity 5′-3′, the DNA replication occurs in short stretches and is called discontinuous.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) Replication of DNA does not initiate randomly, and DNA polymerases on their own cannot initiate replication. So, there is a need of specific sequence, called origin of replication from which the replication starts. DNA polymerase binds to it and continues the process.

          (ii) Write the aim of the experiment. (Delhi 2010C; All India 2010)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) They worked with bacteriophage, i.e. viruses that infect bacteria. These viruses were used because during infection they transfer their genetic material into bacteria.
          <br/>
          (ii) They used two types of culture media, containing
          <sup>
           35
          </sup>
          S and
          <sup>
           32
          </sup>
          P, so as to compare that which one out of DNA and proteins gets transferred from virus to bacteria and acts as genetic material.
          <br/>
          (iii) A blender and centrifuge was used to open up the bacterial cells and viral particles, so, that genetic material could be exposed.
          <br/>
          (iv) Conclusion DNA is the genetic material.
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase (1952) established that DNA is transferred from viruses that infect bacteria. In their experiment, bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) were used. They grew some viruses on a medium that contained radioactive phosphorus and some others on medium containing radioactive sulphur. Viruses grown in the presence of radioactive phosphorus contained radioactive DNA, but not radioactive protein because DNA contains phosphorus, but protein does not. In the same way, viruses grown on radioactive sulphur contained radioactive protein, but not radioactive DNA because DNA does not contain sulphur. Radioactive phages were allowed to attach to E.coli bacteria. As the infection proceeded, viral coats were removed from the bacteria by agitating them in a blender. The virus particles were seperated from the bacteria by spinning them in centrifuge.

<p>
          Bacteria which were infected with viruses that had radioactive DNA were radioactive, indicating that DNA was the material that passed from the virus to the bacteria. Bacteria that were infected with viruses that had radioactive proteins were not radioactive. This indicated that the proteins did not enter the bacteria from viruses. It proved that DNA is the genetic material that is passed from virus to bacteria.

<p>
          Question 63.
          <br/>
          (i) Name the stage in the cell cycle where DNA replication occurs.
          <br/>
          (ii) Explain the mechanism of DNA replication. Highlight the role of enzymes in the process.
          <br/>
          (iii) Why is DNA replication said to be semi-conservative? (All India 2016)
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          (i) Explain the process of DNA replication with the help of a schematic diagram.
          <br/>
          (ii) In which phase of the cell cycle does replication occur in eukaryotes? What would happen if cell division is not followed after DNA replication? (Delhi 2014)
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          (i) Draw a labelled diagram of a ‘replicating fork’ showing the polarity. Why does DNA replication occur within such ‘forks’?
          <br/>
          (ii) Name two enzymes involved in the process of DNA replication, along with their properties. (Outside Delhi 2015)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) During the synthetic phase of interphase of cell cycle DNA duplicates or replicates.
          <br/>
          (ii) Process of DNA Replication Replication is an energy expensive process, deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate serves the dual purpose of
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           acting as a substrate.
          </li>
<li>
           providing energy (from two terminal phosphates).
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          In a long DNA molecule, replication takes place within a small opening of the DNA helix, known as replication fork because whole DNA does not open in one stretch due to high energy requirement. DNA dependent DNA polymerases catalyse polymerisation only in one direction, i.e. 5′ → 3′. This brings additional complications at the replication fork.
         </p>
<p>
          On one strand (template with polarity 3′ → 5′), replication is continuous, while on the 5′ → 3′ strand, replication is discontinuous.
          <br/>
          Thus, the fragments synthesised are discontinuous and later joined by the enzyme DNA ligase.
          <br/>
          The DNA polymerases cannot initiate replication process on their own and replication does not initiate randomly anywhere in DNA.
          <br/>
          It begins at definite regions in a DNA molecule known as origin of replication (Ori).

</p>
<p>
          Enzymes for DNA Replication
          <br/>
          The process of replication requires a set of catalysts (enzymes) as given below
          <br/>
          (a) DNA-Dependent DNA Polymerase: It is the main enzyme which uses a DNA template to catalyse the polymerisation of deoxynucleotides. The average rate of polymerisation is 2000 bp (base pairs) per second approximately. These enzymes are highly efficient as they have to catalyse polymerisation of a large number of nucleotides in a very short time. These polymerases act very fast, catalyse the replication process with high degree of accuracy as any mistake would result in mutations.
         </p>
<p>
          (b) Helicase It unwinds the DNA strand, i.e. separates the two strands from one point for the formation of a replication fork.
         </p>
<p>
          (c) DNA Ligase It facilitates the joining of DNA strands together by catalysing the formation of phosphodiester bond. It plays a role in repairing single strand breaks in duplex DNA.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) It is said to be semi-conservative because in newly synthesised DNA, one strand is parental and one is new, so it conserves the one strand. DNA replication is followed by cell division. In case, the latter fails to occur, polyploidy may occur.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 64.
          <br/>
          List the criteria of a molecule that can act as genetic material must fulfil. Which one of the criteria is best fulfilled by DNA or by RNA thus making one of them a better genetic material than the other? Explain. (All India 2016)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          From the Hershey and Chase experiment, the fact was established that DNA acts as genetic material. But later studies revealed that in some viruses (e.g. Tobacco Mosaic Viruses, QB bacteriophage, etc.) RNA is the genetic material. Following are the criteria that a molecule must fulfil to act as a genetic material.
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           It- should be able to replicate.
          </li>
<li>
           It should be chemically and structurally stable.
          </li>
<li>
           It should provide the scope for slow changes (mutation), which are required for evolution.
          </li>
<li>
           It should be able to express itself in the form of ‘Mendelian characters’.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          According to these criteria, both DNA and RNA have the ability to direct their duplications (because of the rule of base pairing and complementarity).
         </p>
<p>
          So, both the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) have the ability to direct their duplications, whereas the other molecules in the living system, fail to fulfil first criteria itself, e.g. protein. The most important criteria of genetic material is the stability as the genetic material should not change with the different stages of life cycle, age or with change in the physiology of an organism. Both DNA and RNA have the ability to mutate. Since, RNA is unstable, it mutates at a faster rate. That is why, those viruses, which have RNA genome and a shorter lifespan, undergo mutation and thus, evolve rapidly.
         </p>
<p>
          DNA is dependant on RNA for protein synthesis, whereas RNA directly codes for protein synthesis. This proves that both RNA and DNA act as genetic material, but DNA being more stable is preferred for the storage of genetic information.

          Question 66.
          <br/>
          (i) How are the following formed and involved in DNA packaging in the nucleus of a cell?
          <br/>
          (a) Histone octamer
          <br/>
          (b) Nucleosome
          <br/>
          (c) Chromatin
          <br/>
          (ii) Differentiate between euchromatin and heterochromatin. (All India 2016)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) (a) Histone Octamer Histones are the proteins that are rich in basic amino acids, i.e. lysine and arginine. Both these amino acids carry positive charges in their side chains. So, histones are a set of positively charged, basic proteins (histones + protamine). A histone octamer is formed by the organisation of two molecules each of H
          <sub>
           2
          </sub>
          A, H
          <sub>
           2
          </sub>
          B, H
          <sub>
           3
          </sub>
          and H
          <sub>
           4
          </sub>
          histones so asa to make a unit of 8 molecules. It helps to package DNA into nucleosome.
         </p>
<p>
          (b) Nucleosome The negatively charged DNA is wrapped around the positively charged histone octamer, forming a structure known as nucleosome. It forms the fundamental repeating units of eukaryotic chromatin. It is used to pack the large eukaryotic genome into the nucleus.
         </p>
<p>
          (c) Chromatin One nucleosome contains 200 base pairs of DNA helix, approximately. Nucleosomes are the repeating unit of chromatin, which are thread-like stained (coloured) bodies present in nucleus.
         </p>
<p>
          The nucleosomes in chromatin look like ‘beads-on-string’ when observed under an electron microscope. The chromatin is further packed to form a solenoid structure of 30 mm diameter and further supercoiling tends to form a looped structure called chromatin fibre and then chromatid. This further coils and condenses at metaphase stage to form the chromosomes.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Differences between euchromatin and heterochromatin are as follows
         </p>
<table border="2">

<tr>
<td>
             Euchromatin

          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          Describe Frederick Griffith’s experiment on Streptococcus pneumoniae. Discuss the conclusion he arrived at. (All India 2012)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) Griffith Experiments: It took a long time to discover and prove that DNA acts as a genetic material. By 1926, the quest to determine the mechanism for genetic inheritance had reached the molecular level. Transforming Principle Frederick Griffith in 1928, carried out a series of experiments with Streptococcus pneumoniae (a bacterium that causes pneumonia).
         </p>
<p>
          He observed that when these bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae) were grown on a culture plate, some of them produced smooth, shiny colonies (S-type), whereas the others produced rough colonies (R-type).
         </p>
<p>
          This difference in appearance of colonies (smooth/rough) was due to the presence or absence of mucus (polysaccharide) coat.
          <br/>
          In his experiments, he first infected two separate groups of mice as follows S-strain (virulent strain) → Inject into mice → Mice die.
         </p>
<p>
          R-strain (non-virulent strain) → Inject into mice → Mice live.
          <br/>
          S-strain (heat-killed) → Inject into mice → Mice live.
          <br/>
          S-strain (heat-killed) + R-strain (live) → Inject into mice → Mice die.
         </p>
<p>
          Griffith concluded that the live R-strain, bacteria, had been transformed by the heat-killed S-strain bacteria. He concluded that, there was some ‘transforming agent that was transferred from the heat-killed S-strain, which helped the R-strain bacteria to synthesise a smooth polysaccharide coat and thus, become virulent.
         </p>
<p>
          He concluded that must be due to the transfer of the genetic material. However, he was not able to define the biochemical nature of genetic material from his experiments.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Contributions of MacLeod, McCarty and Avery : These scientists worked to determine the chemical nature of transforming principle of Griffith’s experiments. They discovered that protein digesting enzymes (proteases) and RNA-digesting.enzymes (RNase) did not affect transformation. Digestion with DNase did inhibit transformation suggesting that DNA was responsible for the transformation.

           Cleavage Larger RNA precursors are cleaved to form smaller RNAs.
          </li>
<li>
           Splicing Eukaryotic transcripts possess extra segments called introns which are non-functional. They do not appear in mature or processed RNA. The functional coding sequences are called exons. Splicing is the removal of introns and fusion of exons in a definite order to form functional RNAs.
          </li>
<li>
           Terminal additions (capping and tailing) Capping includes addition of an unusual nucleotide to 5’ end of hrRNA. These unusual segments are CCA segment in tRNA and cap nucleotides at 5’end of mRNA. In tailing, poly-A segment (200-300 residues) are added at 3’end of mRNA. Cap is formed by the modification of GTP into 7-methyl guanosine or 7 mG.
          </li>
<li>
           Nucleotide modifications They are most common in tRNA-methylation (i.e. methyl cytosine, methyl guanosine), deamination (e.g. inosine form adenine), dihydrouracil, pseudouracil, etc.

          Question 69.
          <br/>
          Explain the process of transcription in prokaryotes. How is the process different in eukaryotes? (Outside Delhi 2015)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          In prokaryotes or bacterial cell, transcription occurs in three steps-initiation elongation and termination. For detail, Refer to text on pages 138-139.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 70.
          <br/>
          (i) Explain the role of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase in initiation, elongation and termination during transcription in bacterial cell.
          <br/>
          (ii) How is transcription a more complex process in eukaryotic cells? Explain. (Foreign 2011)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) Role of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           RNA polymerase becomes associated transiently with initiation factor (σ) and binds to the promoter site on DNA and initiates transcription.
          </li>
<li>
           It uses the nucleoside triphosphate as substrates and polymerises them in a template-dependent fashion following the base complementarity rule in the 5′ → 3′ direction.
          </li>
<li>
           It also facilitates the opening of the DNA helix and continues the elongation process.
          </li>
<li>
           When the polymerase falls off a terminator region on the DNA, the nascent RNA separates. This results in termination.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          (ii) Reasons that transcription is more complex in eukaryotes are
          <br/>
          (a) The three types of RNA polymerases in the nucleus show division of labour.
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           RNA polymerase-I transcribes rRNAs (28S, 18S and 5.8S).
          </li>
<li>
           RNA polymerase-II transcribes the precursor of mRNA, called hnRNA.
          </li>
<li>
           RNA polymerase-III transcribes tRNA, 5 SrRNA and snRNAse.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          (b) hnRNA contains both coding sequences called exons and non-coding sequences called introns. So, it undergoes a process called splicing, in which the non-coding sequences (introns) are removed and the coding sequences (exons) are joined together in a defined order.
         </p>
<p>
          (c) In capping, unusual nucleotide, methyl guanosine triphosphate residues are added at the 5’end of the hnRNA.
         </p>
<p>
          (d) In tailing, 200-300 adenylate residues are added at the 3’ end of the hnRNA.
         </p>

          (i) The difference between unambiguous and universal genetic codes is as follows
          <br/>
          Unambiguous:
          <br/>
          In genetic code, one codon codes for only one amino acid, hence it is unambiguous.
         </p>
<p>
          Universal:
          <br/>
          The genetic code is universal, i.e. each codon codes for same amino acid in all organisms.

          Question 85.
          <br/>
          Following are the features of genetic codes. What does each one indicate? (All India 2016)
          <br/>
          Stop codon, Unambiguous codon, Degenerate codon, Universal codon.
          <br/>
          Answer:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Stop codon does not code for any amino acids, e.g. UGA.
          </li>
<li>
           Unambiguous codon codes for only one . amino acid, e.g. CCG codes for proline.
          </li>
<li>
           Degenerate codon Genetic code is described as degenerate when a single amino acid is coded by more than one codon, e.g. serine is coded by 6 codons.
          </li>

          Question 86.
          <br/>
          What is aminoacylation? State its significance. (All India 2016)
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          Explain aminoacylation of tRNA. (All India 2014C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Aminoacylation or charging of tRNA is a process in which amino acids get activated in the presence of ATP and get linked to their cognate tRNA.
          <br/>
          Significance of aminoacylation The charged tRNA carries amino acids to the site of protein synthesis. If two charged tRNAs are brought close to each other, the formation of peptide bond is favoured energetically.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 87.
          <br/>
          State the functions of ribozyme and release factor in protein synthesis, respectively. (Outside Delhi 2015C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Ribozyme in bacteria is 23S rRNA, that acts as an enzyme for the formation of a peptide bond between two amino acids.
          <br/>
          Release factor binds to the stop condon (UAA) to terminate translation and release the complete polypeptide.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 88.
          <br/>
          How would lac operon operate in E. coli growing in a culture medium, where lactose is present as source of sugar? (All India 2014C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          When lactose is present in a medium having E. coli, it will act as a substrate for enzyme 3-galactosidase and switches on the operon.
          <br/>
          Hence, it is also termed as an inducer. It inactivates repressor by binding to it and allows RNA polymerase access to the promoter.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 89.
          <br/>
          Where does peptide bond formation occur in a bacterial ribosome and how? (Foreign 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          A peptide bond is formed between carboxyl group (-COOH) of amino acid at P-site and amino group (-NH) of amino acid at A-site. It is formed by the enzyme peptidyl transferase in a bacterial ribosome.

          Question 90.
          <br/>
          (i) Name the scientist who suggested that the genetic code should he made of a combination of three nucleotides.
          <br/>
          (ii) Explain the basis on which he arrived at this conclusion. (Delhi 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) George Gamow suggested that the genetic code should be made of a combination of three nucleotides.
          <br/>
          (ii) George stated that a codon must be of three bases in order to code for 20 amino acids, since there are only four bases (i.e. 43 or 4 × 4 × 4 = 64) which code for 20 amino acids.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 91.
          <br/>
          Why is charging of tRNA necessary during translation process? (All India 2014C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Amino acids are activated in the presence of ATP and linked to their cognate tRNA. This is called charging of tRNA (aminoacylation). The process is required as the formation of peptide bond between the amino acids is favoured energetically, when they are brought together. Activation of amino acids by ATP provides the energy for the formation of peptide bond.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 92.
          <br/>
          One of the salient features of the genetic code is that it is nearly universal from bacteria to humans. Mention two exceptions to this rule. Why are some codes said to be degenerated? (Foreign 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Genetic code is nearly universal except in mitochondrial codons and in some protozoans. Some amino acids are coded by more than one codon, hence some codes are said to be degenerated.

          Question 96.
          <br/>
          ‘A very small sample of tissue or even a drop of blood can help determine paternity’. Provide a scientific explanation to substantiate how it is possible. (All India 2019)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          DNA fingerprinting is the basis of paternity testing in case of disputes. This technique is used to distinguish between individual of same species by using their DNA sample. The DNA is isolated from the cells and further amplified to produce many copies by using polymerase chain reaction. This amplified DNA is further processed to detect the presence of similarities between the parent and child.
         </p>
<p>
          Because, the DNA from sample can be amplified to produce many copies in DNA fingerprinting, only a very small sample of tissue or even a drop of blood can help determine paternity.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 97.
          <br/>

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          BAC — Bacterial Artificial Chromosome
          <br/>
          YAC — Yeast Artificial Chromosome.
          <br/>
          ‘BAC’ and ‘YAC’ are used as vectors in cloning of DNA.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 98.
          <br/>
          (i) Expand VNTR and describe its role in DNA fingerprinting.
          <br/>
          (ii) List any two applications of DNA fingerprinting technique. (2018)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) VNTR The expanded form of VNTR is Variable Number of Tandem Repeats. These are short nucleotide repeats in the DNA. These are highly specific for individuals. No two individuals have the same VNTR.
         </p>
<p>
          Role of VNTR in Fingerprinting VNTRs are used as probe markers in the identification of DNA of different individuals because no two individuals can have the same VNTRs (except in case of monozygotic twins).
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Applications of DNA Fingerprinting:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           DNA fingerprinting can identify the real genetic mother, father and offspring.
          </li>
<li>
           DNA fingerprinting is very useful in the detection of crime and legal pursuits.

          </li>
<li>
           Sequence annotation This method involves the sequencing of whole set of genome (that contained all coding and non-coding sequence) and then assigning functions to the different regions in the sequence.
          </li>
</ul>

          Or
          <br/>
          Following a severe accident, many charred-disfigured bodies are recovered from the site making the identification of the dead very difficult. Name and explain the technique that would help the authorities to establish the identity of the dead to be able to handover the dead to their respective relatives. (All India 2014C)
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          In a maternity clinic, for some reasons the authorities are not able to handover the two newborns to their respective real parents. Name and describe the technique that you would suggest to sort out the matter. (All India 2013)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The technique that can help in the identification of victims is DNA fingerprinting which is used to distinguish between individuals of same species by using their DNA sample. The chemical structure of DNA is same in everyone (99.9%) except the order of base pairs, i.e. only 0.1% of DNA makes every individual unique.
          <br/>
          DNA fingerprinting exploits the highly variable tandem repeating sequences, i.e. VNTRs for profiling. These VNTRs are highly conserved among members of the same species.
         </p>
<p>
          Technique:
          <br/>
          This technique is carried out in following steps:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           DNA Isolation DNA is extracted from the cells in a high speed centrifuge.
          </li>
<li>
           Amplification Many copies of the extracted DNA can be made by the use of polymerase chain reaction.
          </li>
<li>
           Digestion of DNA by restriction endonucleases.
          </li>
<li>
           Separation of DNA fragments by electrophoresis.
          </li>
<li>
           Blotting Transfer of separated DNA fragments to synthetic membranes (like nylon or nitrocellulose).
          </li>
<li>
           Hybridisation, with the help of a radio-labelled VNTR probe (small segments of DNA which help to detect the presence of a gene in a long DNA sequence). These probes target a specific nucleotide sequence that is complementary to them.
          </li>
<li>
           Autoradiography Detection of hybridised DNA fragments by autoradiography.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          The presence of similarities between the victims and their relatives determines their association on the basis of which dead bodies or newborns can be identified and handed over to their families.

          <br/>
          (c) Universal codon
          <br/>
          (d) Initiator codon (All India 2010C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) Out of 64 codons, 61 code for amino acids and rest 3 codons do not code for any amino acids. These function as stop codons.
          <br/>
          (ii) (a) Unambiguous and specific codon These code for only one amino acid, thus, making the genetic code unambiguous and specific, e.g. UUU.
          <br/>
          (b) Some amino acids are coded by more than one codon, so the code is degenerate, e.g. serine is coded by 6 codons.
          <br/>
          (c) Codon is nearly universal. Some exceptions to the rule are mitochondrial codon and in some protozoans, e.g. UUU.
          <br/>
          (d) Initiator codon AUG has dual function. It codes for methionine and also acts as initiator.

          Answer:
          <br/>
          The following are the goals of the human genome project:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Identify all the (approximately) 20000-25000 genes in human DNA.
          </li>
<li>
           Determine the sequence of the 8 billion chemical base pairs that make up human DNA.
          </li>
<li>
           Improve tools for data analysis.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          Question 104.
          <br/>
          What is mutation? Explain with the help of an example how does a point mutation affect the genetic code. Name another type of mutation. (Outside Delhi 2016C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          A mutation is a sudden, stable, inheritable change in genetic material. A classical example of point mutation is a change of single base pair in the gene for p-globin chain that results in the change of amino acid residue glutamate to valine in a cell of a person suffering from sickle-cell anaemia. It is a genetic disease.
         </p>
<p>
          The other type of mutation includes frameshift insertion or deletion mutation. The insertion or deletion of one or more bases may change the reading frame from the point of insertion or deletion. Insertion or deletion of three or its multiple bases insert or delete one or multiple codon, hence one or multiple amino acid may be formed in polypeptide.

          Question 105.
          <br/>
          Explain the significance of satellite DNA in DNA fingerprinting technique. (All India 2018)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Significance of satellite DNA in DNA fingerprinting A DNA satellite is a region that consists of short DNA sequences repeated many times. The variation between individuals in the lengths of their DNA satellites forms the basis of DNA fingerprinting.
         </p>
<p>
          DNA satellites are of two types, i.e. microsatellites and minisatellites. Their characteristic that makes them useful for identification is that they are highly polymorphic. The length of each satellite in DNA is inherited.
         </p>
<p>
          The length of satellite regions is highly variable between people. These form small peaks during density gradient centrifugation and thus, are invaluable for identification purposes.

          Question 106.
          <br/>
          Describe how the lac operon operates, both in the presence and the absence of an inducer in E. coli. (All India 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Lac operon is made up of one regulatory gene i and three structural genes (z, y, a).
          <br/>
          Its function in the presence and the absence of inducer is as follows
          <br/>
          (i) When inducer (lactose) is absent, i gene regulates and produces repressor mRNA. The repressor protein binds to the operator region of operon and as a result prevents RNA polymerase to bind to the operon. The operon is switched off in this situation.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) When inducer (lactose) is present, lactose acts as an inducer and binds to the repressor. Thus, forming an inactive repressor. The repressor fails to bind the operator region. The RNA polymerase binds to the operator and transcripts lac mRNA.
         </p>
<p>
          Lac mRNA is known to be polycistronic which produces all three enzymes, i.e. P-galactosidase, permease and transacetylase required for the hydrolysis of lact &gt;se. Operon is switched on in this situation.
         </p>

          Question 113.
          <br/>
          How are the structural genes activated in lac operon in E. coli ? (All India 2012)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Lac operon consists of
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           an operator, which controls all structural genes as a unit
          </li>
<li>
           a regulatory gene (i gene)
          </li>
<li>
           three structural genes (z, y, a), which code for enzymes and
          </li>
<li>
           a promoter, where RNA polymerase binds for transcription.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          The regulatory gene codes for a repressor protein that has high affinity for the operator region and which prevents RNA polymerase from transcribing the structural genes, i.e. the lac operon is switched off or inactive.
          <br/>

<br/>
          Lac operon in the presence of inducer When inducer (lactose) is added, it binds with repressor protein and inactivates it. This allows RNA polymerase to have access to the promoter and transcription proceeds via the activation of structural genes.

          Question 114.
          <br/>
          (i) Name the scientist who called tRNA an adapter molecule.

          Question 115.
          <br/>
          A considerable amount of lactose is added to the growth medium of E. coli. How is the lac operon switched on in the bacteria? Mention the state of the operon when lactose is digested. (All India 2010C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          In lac operon, when lactose is added, it enters the cell wall with the help of permease, a small amount of which is already present in cell. Lactose binds itself to active repressor and changes its structure. The repressor now fails to bind to the operator.
         </p>
<p>
          Then, RNA polymerase starts transcription of operon by binding to promoter site-P. All the three enzymes for lactose metabolism are synthesised.
          <br/>
          After some time, when whole of lactose is consumed, there is no inducer present to bind to the repressor. Due to this, the repressor becomes active again, attaches itself to the operator and finally switches off the operon.

          (ii) Draw and label a secondary structure of tRNA. How does the actual structure of tRNA look like? (All India 2010C)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) tRNA binds to a specific amino acid and it also reads the codon of the amino acid bound to it through its anticodon. So, it is called an adapter molecule.

<br/>
          (i) Identify and name the regulatory gene in this operon. Explain its role in switching off the operon.
          <br/>
          (ii) Why is lac operon’s regulation referred to as negative regulation?
          <br/>
          (iii) Name the inducer molecule and the products of the genes z and y of the operon. Write the function of these gene products. (All India 2019, Foreign 2010, Delhi 2010)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) i gene-regulatory gene : It codes for the repressor protein of the operon, which is synthesised constitutively. The repressor has the affinity for the operator gene. It binds to the operator and prevents the RNA polymerase from transcribing the structural genes.
          <br/>
          (ii) When repressor binds to the operator, the operon is switched off and transcription is stopped. So, it is called negative regulation.
          <br/>
          (iii) Lactose is an inducer molecule.
          <br/>
          Gene ‘Z’ codes for p-galactosidase, which is responsible for the hydrolysis of lactose into galactose and glucose.
          <br/>
          ‘y’ gene codes for permease. It increases the permeability of the cell to lactose.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 119.
          <br/>
          (i) Write the contributions of the following scientists in deciphering the genetic code.
          <br/>
          George Gamow, Har Gobind Khorana, Marshall Nirenberg, Severo Ochoa.
          <br/>
          (ii) State the importance of genetic code in protein biosynthesis. (Delhi 2019)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) George Gamow coined the term genetic code and argued that since there are only four bases and if they have to code for 20 amino acids, the code should constitute a contribution of bases.
          <br/>
          He suggested that in order to code for all* the amino acids the genetic code should be made up of 3 nucleotides.
         </p>
<p>
          Har Gobind Khorana developed a chemical 52 method for the synthesis of RNA molecule with defined base combinations (homopolymers and copolymers). Marshall Nirenberg Put forward a cell-free system for protein synthesis that helps in deciphering the code.
          <br/>
          Severo Ochoa Showed that the polynucleotide phosphorylase also helped in polymerising RNA with defined sequences in a template independent manner (enzymatic RNA synthesis).
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) The genetic code is the set of rules by which information encoded in genetic material is translated into proteins by living cells. The genetic code is nearly universal language that encodes directions for cells. Their arrangement as codons, stores the blueprint for amino acid chain. This chain in turn forms proteins which regulate the biological process in every living beings.

          Question 124.
          <br/>
          How do mRNA, tRNA and ribosomes help in the process of translation? (All India 2015)
          <br/>
          Or
          <br/>
          Name the major types of RNAs and explain their role in the process of protein synthesis in a prokaryote. (Foreign 2014)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) Translation is the process of polymerisation of amino acids to form a polypeptide. The role of mRNA, tRNA and ribosomes in the process is described below
          <br/>
          (a) Role of mRNA The order and sequence of amino acids are defined by the sequence of bases in the mRNA. It stores the genetic information from DNA. The amino acids are joined by a bond, which is known as a peptide bond.
          <br/>
          This process requires energy mRNA also possesses untranslated sequences called Untranslated Regions (UTR) at both 5′ end and 3′ end. They help in efficient translation.
         </p>
<p>
          (b) Role of (RNA It acts as an adaptor molecule. Activation of amino acids occurs in the presence of ATP and activated amino acids get linked to their cognate tRNA, i.e. charging of fRNA or aminoacylation of tRNA.
         </p>
<p>
          If two such charged fRNAs are brought closer, the formation of peptide bond between them would occur energetically in the presence of a catalyst.
         </p>
<p>
          (c) Role of /RNA It is formed in nucleolus and it forms 80% of total RNA present inside the cell. It is also the most stable type of RNA. rRNA is associated with structural organisation of ribosomes (rRNA forms about 60% of weight of ribosomes), which are seats of protein synthesis.
         </p>
<p>
          (d) Role of ribosomes Initiation of polypeptide synthesis occurs in ribosomes (cellular factory for protein synthesis).
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Ribosome consists of structural RNAs and about 80 different proteins.
          </li>
<li>
           In its inactive state, it exists as two subunits, i.e. a large and a small subunit.
          </li>
<li>
           When the small subunit encounters an mRNA, the process of translation of the mRNA to protein begins.
          </li>
<li>
           There are two sites in the large subunit, i.e. the P-site and A-site for subsequent amino acids to bind to and thus, be close enough to each other for the formation of a peptide bond.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          The small subunit (with the fRNA) attaches to the large subunit in such a way that the initiation codon (AUG) comes to the P-site.

          Question 127.
          <br/>
          Given below is the schematic representation of lac operon of E.coli. Explain the functioning of this operon when lactose is provided in the growth medium of the bacteria.
          <br/>
<img alt="Molecular Basis of Inheritance Class 12 Important Questions and Answers Biology Chapter 6 Img 36" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-147420" height="42" loading="lazy" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Molecular-Basis-of-Inheritance-Class-12-Important-Questions-and-Answers-Biology-Chapter-6-Img-36.png" width="166"/>
<br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Lactose in the lac operon regulates operon, by switching on and off. If lactose is present in the medium, it acts as an inducer here and the substrate for the enzyme p-galactosidase.
          <br/>
          It binds to the repressor and forms an inactive repressor, which fails to bind to the operator region of the operon.
          <br/>
<img alt="Molecular Basis of Inheritance Class 12 Important Questions and Answers Biology Chapter 6 Img 37" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-147421" height="210" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 348px) 100vw, 348px" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Molecular-Basis-of-Inheritance-Class-12-Important-Questions-and-Answers-Biology-Chapter-6-Img-37.png" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Molecular-Basis-of-Inheritance-Class-12-Important-Questions-and-Answers-Biology-Chapter-6-Img-37.png 348w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Molecular-Basis-of-Inheritance-Class-12-Important-Questions-and-Answers-Biology-Chapter-6-Img-37-300x181.png 300w" width="348"/>
<br/>
          The RNA polymerase thus, binds to the operator and transcribes lac-mKNA. Lac mRNA produces all three enzymes, i.e. P-galactosidase, permease and transacetylase of polycistronic structural gene present in E.coli.
          <br/>
          Therefore, operon will be switched on in the presence of the lactose.

          (ii) Mention the causes of DNA polymorphism. (Foreign 2010)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) DNA polymorphism It is the occurrence of inheritable mutations at a frequency greater than 0.01 in a population.

          Question 130.
          <br/>
          (i) Name the enzyme responsible for transcription of tRNA and the amino acid, the initiator tRNA gets linked with.
          <br/>
          (ii) Explain the role of initiator tRNA in initiation of protein synthesis. (Delhi 2012)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) RNA polymerase transcribes tRNA and the amino acid, the initiator tRNA gets linked with is methionine.
          <br/>
          (ii) The initiator tRNA binds the amino acid methionine at its amino acid acceptor site. It has anticodon loop, which has anticodon for methionine, i.e. UAC. It recognises the start codon (AUG) at P-site and binds to it according to complementarity of bases.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 131.
          <br/>
          (i) Describe the process of aminoacylation.
          <br/>
          (ii) ‘Process of transcription and translation are coupled in prokaryotes, but not in eukaryotes’. Explain. (All India 2019)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) Refer to Answer No. 14 on page no. 171.
          <br/>
          (ii) In bacteria, both processes occur in cytoplasm as there is no nucleus. In eukaryotes, transcription occurs in nucleus, while translation occurs in the cytoplasm.
         </p>
<p>
          Complexities in eukaryotic transcription: Eukaryotes have additional complexities in gene expression than prokaryotes as mentioned in gene expression below
          <br/>
          (a) There are at least three RNA polymerases in the nucleus other than the RNA polymerase in organelles. The RNA polymerase-I transcribes rRNAs (28S, 18S and 5.8S). RNA polymerase-III is responsible for the transcription of tRNA, 5srRNA and snRNAs (small nuclear RNAs). RNA polymerase-II transcribes precursor of mRNA, the heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA).
         </p>
<p>
          (b) Another complexity is that, the primary transcripts contain both the exons and the introns and are nonfunctional. Hence, it is subjected to a process called splicing.
          <br/>
          In this process, introns are removed and exons are joined in a definite order.
         </p>
<p>
          (c) hnRNA undergoes additional processing called capping and tailing. In capping, an unusual nucleotide is added to the 5′ end of ImRNA.
         </p>
<p>
          In tailing, adenylate residues (200-300) are added at 3′ end in a template. Capping and tailing protect the mRNA from degradation by the activity of digestive enzymes present in the cytoplasm. It is the fully processed hnRNA, now called mRNA, that is transported out of the nucleus for translation process.
         </p>
<p>
          Complexities in translation in eukaryotes
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           The mRNA formed in nucleus has to be transported to the cytoplasm.
          </li>
<li>
           Transcription and translation cannot be coupled in eukaryotes.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          Question 132.
          <br/>
          (i) Describe the structure and function of a tRNA molecule. Why is it referred to as an adapter molecule?
          <br/>
          (ii) Explain the process of splicing of hnRNA in a eukaryotic cell. (All India 2017)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          (i) Structure of tRNA
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           The secondary structure of tRNA looks like a clover-leaf.
          </li>
<li>
           All tRNA molecules have a guanine residue at its 5’end.
          </li>
<li>
           At its 3′ end an unpaired CCA sequence is present. Amino acids get attached to this end during translation.
          </li>
<li>
           tRNA has an anticodon loop, an amino acid acceptor arm, and a ribosome site.
          </li>
<li>
           The anticodon loop has bases complementary to the code. Amino acid acceptor end binds to amino acids.
          </li>
</ul>

<br/>
          Function of tRNA The function of tRNA is to align the required amino acids according to the nucleotide sequence of mRNA. tRNA is also called the adapter molecule because on one hand it can read the code and on the other hand it can bind to specific amino acid. It acts as intermediate molecule between triplet code of mRNA and amino acid sequence of polypeptide chain.
         </p>
<p>
          (ii) Splicing of hnRNA Eukaryotic transcripts possess extra segments called introns or intervening sequences or non-coding sequences. They do not appear in mature or processed RNA. The functional coding sequences are called exons. Splicing is removal of introns and fusion of exons to form functional RNAs. A complex called spliceosome is formed between 5’end (GU) and 3’end (AG) of intron. Energy is obtained from ATP. It removes the introns. The adjacent exons are brought together. The ends are sealed by RNA ligase.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 133.
          <br/>
          Where do transcription and translation occur in bacteria and eukaryotes, respectively? Explain the complexities in transcription and translation in eukaryotes that are not seen in bacteria. (Foreign 2010)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          In bacteria, both processes occur in cytoplasm as there is no nucleus.
          <br/>
          In eukaryotes, transcription occurs in nucleus, while translation occurs in the cytoplasm. Complexities in eukaryotic transcription Refer to Answer No. 2. (ii)
         </p>
<p>
          Complexities in translation in eukaryotes are
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           The OTRNA formed in nucleus has to be transported to the cytoplasm.
          </li>
<li>
           Transcription and translation cannot be coupled in eukaryotes.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          Question 134.
          <br/>
          According to human genome project, about 99.9% nucleotide bases are exactly the same in all humans. Do you think the discrimination of people on the basis of colour, creed and religion is correct? Justify.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          No discrimination of people on these grounds is not correct because all people have same genetic material (i.e. DNA) and are similar in their makeup.
