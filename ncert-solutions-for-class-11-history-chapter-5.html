          Class 11 History Chapter 5 NCERT Textbook Questions Solved
         </h3>
<p>
          Question 1.
          <br/>
          Why was trade so significant to the Mongols?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The region which was occupied by Mongols lacked natural resources. The steppe region of Central Asia had extreme climate. Cultivation of food was not possible there, only trade could help their survival. The Mongols were forced to trade as the scanty resources of the steppes did not help cultivation. So the Mongols traded with neighboring countries and it was beneficial for both the countries.
         </p>
<p>
          Question 2.
          <br/>
          Why did Genghis Khan feel the need to fragment the Mongol tribes into new social and military groupings?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The following reasons forced Genghis Khan to fragment the Mongol tribes into new social and military groupings:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Mongols were the inhabitants of the steppe region. They had their own separate identities. So in order to bring them in touch with other tribes, Genghis Khan took this step.
          </li>
<li>
           Mongols were courageous people. Because of this nature, Genghis Khan organized them into military groups and established a formidable army. A sound military organization could be very helpful in trade also .
          </li>
<li>
           Childhood experiences of Genghis Khan were also responsible for the fragmentation of Mongol tribes. Genghis Khan himself had to suffer a lot during his childhood.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          Question 3.
          <br/>
          How do later Mongol reflections on the Yasa bring out the uneasy relationship they had with the memory of Genghis Khan?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Yasa were the rules and regulations. These were approved by Quritali during Genghis Khan’s reign. These rules were mainly concerned with Mongol army, hunting, postage system, social ladder, etc. They were compilation of traditions and customs that prevailed in Mongol tribal society itself.

          Question 4.
          <br/>
          “If history relies upon written records produced by city-based literati, nomadic societies will always receive a hostile representation.” Would you agree with this statement ? Does it explain the reason why Persian chronicles produced such inflated figures of casualties resulting from Mongol campaigns? (HOTS)
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Yes, I agree with the statement. I give the following reasons for my view.
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           There were vast differences between The Secret Society of Mongols and Marco Polo’s Travelogues in terms of events and their descriptions.
          </li>
<li>
           Being the transcontinental span of the Mongol empire, the sources were written in different languages.
          </li>
<li>
           Persian chronicles produced inflated figures of casualties resulting from Mongol campaigns to prove their cruelty or to prove them as cruel assassins
          </li>
</ul>

<strong>
           Class 11 History Chapter 3 Answer In A Short Essay
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Question 5.
          <br/>
          Keeping the nomadic element of the Mongol and Bedouin societies in mind, how, in your opinion, did their respective historical experiences differ? What explanations would you suggest account for these differences?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Mongols were tribes in the steppes of central Asia, a diverse body of people linked by similarity in language to Tatars, Khitan and Manchus in east and Turkic tribes to the west. Bedouins were Arab tribes moving from dry to green desert in search of food and fodder for cattle. Some Mongols were pastoralists while others were hunter-gatherers. On the other hand, Bedouins were pastoralists, agriculturists and traders because of central Islamic lands surrounded by seas from four sides. The steppes inhabitants usually produced no literature , so our knowledge of nomadic societies under Mongols are quite different and the Italian and Latin versions of Marco- Polo’s Travels to the Mongol Court do not match.

          Question 6.
          <br/>
          How does the following account enlarge upon the character of the Pax Mongolica created by the Mongols by the middle of the thirteenth century?
          <br/>
          The Franciscan monk, William of Rubruck, was sent by Louis IX of France on an embassy to the great Khan Mongke’s court. He reached Karakorum, the capital of Mongke, in 1254 and came upon a woman from Lorraine (in France) called Paquette, who had been brought from Hungary and was in the service of one of the prince’s wives who was a Nestorian Christian. At the court he came across a Parisian goldsmith named Guillaume Boucher, ‘whose brother dwelt on the Grand Pont in Paris’. This man was first employed by the Queen Sorghaqtani and then by Mongke’s younger brother. Rubruck found that at the great court festivals the Nestorian priests were admitted first, with their regalia, to bless the Grand Khan’s cup, and were followed by the Muslim clergy and Buddhist and Taoist monks.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The above account depicts the character of the Pax Mongolica by the middle of the 13th century:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           It became clear from the above incident that the French Monarch Louis IX had sent his ambassador William of Rubruck to Karakorum, the capital of Mongke in 1254. This depicts that Mongol rulers had established a well-knit relation with their neighbours.
          </li>
<li>
           Guillaume Boucher proved that Mongol rulers lived with great pomp and show and they had brought servants to serve them from different parts of the world. They were paid good salaries. That is why they reached to serve Mongol court from far away.
          </li>
<li>
           Mongol rulers were not fanatics and anxious to get the blessings of all the people. They recruited administrators and armed forces from people of all ethnic groups and religions. There was a multilingual, multi-religious regime that did not feel threatened by its pluralistic constitution. The above descriptions display the best aspect of Pax-Mongolica. It is said that in a vast empire, the Mongols had established such a rule that one could walk freely without the fear of robbery.

          Question 3.
          <br/>
          How did the Mongol carry out their trade?
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          The scarcity of resources forced the nomadic tribes (the Mongols) to depend on the other neighboring countries for the essential goods for trade. Their trade was based on barter system, which was beneficial for both parties engaged in trade. They imported agricultural products and made implements from China and in line of these they used to export horses, fur and animals used for hunting. The nomadic people used to suffer less as compared to their opponents. The possible reason behind that was the nomadic people quickly disappeared from the place of their strife after carrying out loot and plunder. It meant several losses for trading partner, i.e. China. In order to safeguard their people from Mongol strife’s, the ruler of China constructed the ‘Great Wall of China’.

          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Genghis Khan was the greatest Mongol who laid the foundation of Nomadic empire. His contribution was immense in unifying Mongols. It was due to his efforts that a vast Mongol empire was established. He was born in the year 1162. He was born near the river Onon. His father’s name was Yesugei, who was the chief of the tribe, Kiyat. His mother Oleun-eke belonged to Onggerat tribe. His original name was Temujin. He grew up as a brave man. He organized a powerful army which helped him to lay down the foundation of a vast empire. His main achievements were the conquest of Northern China, conquest of Qara Katie, etc. During the period from 1219 to 1222 CE the Mongol forces occupied Bukhara, Samarqand, Balk, Marv, Nishapur and Herat. Genghis not only built vast empire but also contributed a lot in improving the civil administration of the empire.

          How did Temujin become Genghis Khan? Discuss.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          No doubt, Temujin was a bom commander. His initial success made him more influential. Jamuque was unable to see the growing friendly relations between Temujin and Tughril Khan. Thus, he started be-friending all the tribes hostile to Temujin. Temujin was unable to tolerate it and gave a crushing defeat to Jamuqua with the help of Tughril Khan. Encouraged by the defeat over the powerful Jamuqua, he concentrated towards Taters, Naimaans and Kereyits. Later on Tughril Khan also became hostile to Temujin and was defeated. Thus, he became the most influential person in the politics of steppe region. Keeping his achievement in mind, Quriltai awarded him with the title of Genghis Khan which means universal sovereign.

          <br/>
          During the tenure of Genghis Khan, China was divided into three realms. These realms were North-West region, North China and South China. Each realm was governed by different ruling dynasties. His campaign against China was the result of a long drawn-out process. Northern China was invaded by Genghis Khan in 1211. It was then under the influence of Chin dynasty. The Chin ruler gave him a stiff competition. He also posed many difficulties for Genghis Khan. Tc win over him, Genghis Khan took recourse to diplomacy and instigated the people of the South Manchuria against Chin ruler. This resulted in weakening of the position of Chin ruler. Thus, he succeeded in occupying Peking in 1215. After this, Genghis Khan unleashed a reign of loot and terror in Peking. This victory of Genghis Khan encouraged his soldiers to a great extent. After this successful invasion he returned to Mongolia in 1216.

          Answer:
          <br/>
          Yam was a military post, established by Genghis Khan. During the Mongol Empire, such posts were created at a distance of 25 miles. At these posts cavaliers and messengers were appointed and horses were placed at their disposal. These cavaliers used to carry official records from one place to another. Each cavalier was required to tie a bell with the neck of his horse. Whenever, a message used to reach near a post, the messenger present at post, on listening the ring of the bell so tied with the neck of horse, used to get ready along with horse to leave for the next destination. At Yam, proper arrangements were also made for the travellers. With the aim to make their stay secure and comfortable the travellers were issued official passes, known as Paiza. These passes were of three types—gold, silver and iron. The travellers had to tie these passes (Paiza) on their forehead. The travellers were provided facilities at every Yam, according to these passes. The institution proved very successful for the Mongol administration.

          <br/>
          The Mongols belonged to a nomadic society. The main aim in their life was to collect booty for their survival. Mongols were much inclined towards establishing a good administration for the people being ruled by them. Their system of administration as implemented by them was at best, a makeshift effort on their part. But they did not pay heed towards the military administration. They failed to achieve anything remarkable in regard to the civil administration, which was a prerequisite for the consolidation of their empire.

<li>
           His spies used to collect every bit of information about the opponent’s army and gave it to him.
          </li>

          <br/>
          Discuss the rules and regulations of the Yasa as evolved by Genghis Khan.
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Rules and regulations of the Yasa:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           People should believe in one God, because He gives us life and death, riches and poverty.
          </li>
<li>
           All religions are equal. They must be respected. The priests should be exempted from all kinds of taxes, transcending all religious barriers.
          </li>
<li>
           Any person, who proclaimed himself to be a Khan without the recognition of Quriltai, should be awarded death penalty.
          </li>
<li>
           Do not indulge into adultery. People doing so will be given death penalty.
          </li>
<li>
           Do not tell a lie.
          </li>
<li>
           Always respect the aged and the poor and not deceive anyone.
          </li>
<li>
           It was mandatory for all able-bodied persons to serve in the army.
          </li>
<li>
           On the opening of hostilities, the soldiers on leave, were asked to resume their duties immediately.
          </li>
<li>
           Passion involved in spying, giving the false information/evidence/witness should be punished with death penalty.
          </li>
<li>
           No one in his empire can employ a Mongol as his slave or servant.
          </li>
<li>
           If a soldier indulges into loot and plunder without the prior permission of the commander, he should be awarded death penalty.
          </li>
<li>
           All the Mongol princesses should preserve this Yasa, and at the time of need, they should take help from it.
          </li>
<li>
           The armed forces are to be organized into units numbering 10,100, 1000 and 10000. This makes it easier for the army commander to control over military. Yasa played a remarkable role in unifying the Mongols and kept their tribal identity intact. Without any hesitation, we can say that Yasa played a remarkable role in making of global Mongol empire.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          Question 5.
          <br/>
          Discuss the role of civil administration in Mongol administration’
          <br/>
          Answer:
          <br/>
          Genghis Khan belonged to nomadic society. On the basis of capacity he established a vast empire. His empire included the people from various walks of society and they were civilized people. To rule such a diverse society was not an easy task. Hence, he appointed the people belonging to civilized society to look after the civil administration. The officers were concerned with civil administration and were appointed on the basis of merit. No credit was given to tribals or religious affinities while appointing them in civil administration. The civil administration played an outstanding role in strengthening and consolidating the foundation of Mongol empire. They even influenced the Mongol rulers to transform their policies pertaining to administration. He also made Genghis Khan aware about the ‘Importance of Yan system’ as followed in China.

After the conquest of the city, Juwaini reported, Genghis Khan went to the festival ground where the rich residents of the city were and addressed them: ‘O people know that you have committed great sins, and that the great ones among you have committed these sins. If you ask me what proof I have for these words, I say it is because I am the punishment of God. If you had not committed great sins, God would not have sent a punishment like me upon you’… Now one man had escaped from Bukhara after its capture and had come to Khurasan.

          Ghazan Khan (1295-1304) was the first Il-Khanid ruler to convert to Islam. He gave the following speech to the Mongol-Turkish nomad commanders, a speech that was probably drafted by his Persian wazir Rashiduddin and included in the minister’s letters :
         </p>
<p>
          ‘I am not on the side of the Persian peasantry. If there is a purpose in pillaging them all, there is no one with more power to do this than I. Let us rob them together. But if you wish to be certain of collecting grain and food for your tables in the future, I must be harsh with you. You must be taught reason. If you insult the peasantry, take their oxen and seed and trample their crops into the ground, what will you do in the future ? … The obedient peasantry must be distinguished from the peasantry who are rebels.

          Passage 3.
         </p>
<p>
          Yasa:
          <br/>
          In 1221, after the conquest of Bukhara, Genghis Khan had assembled the rich Muslim residents at the festival ground and had admonished them. He called them sinners and warned them to compensate for their sins by parting with their hidden wealth. The episode was dramatic enough to be painted and for a long time afterwards people still remembered the incident. In the late sixteenth century, ‘Abdullah Khan, a distant descendant of Jochi, Genghis Khan’s eldest son, went to the same festival ground in Bukhara. Unlike Genghis Khan, however, ‘Abdullah Khan went to perform his holiday prayers there. His chronicler, Hafiz-i Tanish, reported this performance of Muslim piety by his master and included the surprising comment: ‘this was according to the yasa of Genghis Khan’.
         </p>
<p>
          Questions:
          <br/>
          (i) What is the meaning of Yasa?
          <br/>
          (ii) After which conquest, Genghis Khan had assembled the rich Muslim residents at the festival ground?

         </p>
<p>
          (ii) After the conquest of Bukhara in 1221, Genghis Khan had assembled the rich Muslim residents at the festival ground.
         </p>
<p>
          (iii) Yasa is important because:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           It acknowledged Mongol’s affinity to Genghis Khan and his descendants.
          </li>
<li>
           All religions should be respected and exempted from all sorts of taxation.
          </li>
