          Students Service To Victims Of Fire
          <br/>
          By: Sweety
          <br/>
          L.M. Jain School
         </p>
<p>
          14th February, 20xx. A major slum area in Vilas Nagar was gutted by a massive fire on 10th February, 20xx. The fire whose exact cause is still not very clear caused extensive damage to life and property. Ten persons lost their lives, many were injured and about two hundred people were rendered homeless.

<p>
          In the year 2002 the government had banned the production and use of plastic bags in our country. But unfortunately, these are now being widely used again everywhere. Not only are we using a huge number of polybags daily but we are also discarding them in our drains uncaring about the fact that they will block the flow of drain water. Polybags are also a threat to our environment. They cause pollution, kill wildlife and are responsible for using up the natural resources of the earth. They are one of the main factors that litter the landscape. If burnt, they will infuse the surrounding air with toxic fumes.
         </p>
<p>
          The main problem of plastic bags is that they are non-biodegradable. The decomposition of plastic takes around a thousand years, so with the plastic rubbish produced each day it is likely that this problem will never be solved. While the government works out ways to lessen the impact of polybags on the environment each one of us too should shoulder some responsibility for this problem that ultimately harms us all.

          On the occasion of Independence Day, Zee TV organized a special programme in which differently-abled persons performed in front of a live audience and were also watched by millions of people across the globe.

<p>
          Our shopping for Diwali could not have taken a more ghastly and ugly turn, that was beyond even our worst nightmare. On 24th October, 20xx, a powerful bomb blast rocked the busy Karol Bagh market where I had gone along with my parents for Diwali shopping. The explosion took place at about 6.10 pm near a three-wheeled vehicle which got ripped apart. Within seconds the entire area was strewn with glass and splattered with blood. Amidst utter fear, chaos and confusion people were seen running wildly, some in search of their dear ones and others to ensure their own safety.
         </p>
<p>
          I stood they are dumbfounded, almost paralysed with fear as my parents helped an old couple who had sustained severe injuries in the blast. Not even in my wildest dreams could I have imagined the horrific sights that then met my eyes. I am convinced that these nightmarish sights are there to stay in my memory for a lifetime. Every time I close my eyes I relive those horrifying moments where I can see people wailing and groaning.

          P.D.K. International School, Madurai A fire broke out near our colony, I.G. Extension on 12th October, 20xx. This ghastly fire burnt down at least 50 shanties and about 30 casualties were reported. The meagre belongings of daily wagers and labourers living in this slum were turned to ashes. The pathetic sight of wailing children and women was heartrending. Since the fire broke out at around 7.30 pm, most of the womenfolk were cooking their evening meals. So many slum dwellers had to go hungry that night as the fire brigades took almost four hours to douse the flames and control the fire. People from our colony came forward to help these distressed people. We offered packed food and water to them. The miserable plight of these people as their abodes turned to ashes will continue to haunt the residents of our locality for a long time.

         </p>
<p>
          The training comprised practical sessions in artificial respiration, use of bandages, simple medication through common drugs and ointments etc. Apart from administering first aid in emergency situations, the trainer also made us understand the basis of home nursing. We were also trained in potentially life-saving techniques that can be performed with minimal equipment. At the end of our seven-day camp, we were given a course completion certificate in which our performance was evaluated. We were confident we were now in a position of saving a life in case of an emergency.

          12, M.G. Road, Adayar, Chennai 26th August, 20xx, Chennai: The traffic police has recently launched a special drive against the pollution causing vehicles. This has created more confusion than relief. It has led to traffic jams and crowds at important intersections. The traffic constables have gone into overdrive by putting barricades and conducting checks on pollution. These barricades, put up by the police, create heavy traffic snarls especially during the peak hours. Traffic congestion is a problem for commuters who are invariably delayed in reaching their destination. The police need to restrict their drive to lean traffic hours. This way they will be able to carry forth their drive against pollution without causing inconvenience to the commuters.

          16th April, 20xx: A few teachers and students from Edwin University had visited our school on an exchange programme for ten days. They were given a grand welcome. The principal, staff and students of our school personally accorded them a warm welcome. A cultural extravaganza was held to familiarise them with our traditions and customs. They were served a traditional Indian meal and sweets. It was heartening to see the foreign teachers and students taking active and enthusiastic part in the different programmes we had specially organized for them. Our principal gave the welcome speech and then they were escorted to our school hostel where they stayed during their ten-day tour of our city.

          Staff Correspondent 5th September, 20xx: Tragedy struck the city early on Monday morning when an eight storeyed NDMC building collapsed around 7 a.m. in Central Delhi, near the main railway station. This building, civic officials said, was old and probably not maintained well. Rescuers raced to reach the dozens of people feared trapped in the rubble. At least ten people are reported killed and twenty have been so far pulled alive from the building and rushed to the hospital, said Alok Bansal, local commander of the National Disaster Response Force. “Approximately 70 to 80 people are believed to be left behind under the debris.”, Mr. Bansal said, citing reports from his team on the scene. This is the latest of several building collapses in Delhi and NCR this year. The State Government has ordered an enquiry into the mishap.

<p>
          Student Editor The Zonal Cricket Tournament was held in the playground of A.B.C. School, Laxmi Nagar from the 20th to the 27th of September, 20xx. The participating teams included JMJ School Rohini; XYZ Public School, Roop Nagar; PQR Public School, Fatehpuri; MPL School, Azadpur; RPW Senior Secondary School, Paschim Vihar and LML Boys School, Patel Nagar. After a series of knockout rounds, PQR Public School and XYZ Public School emerged as the finalists.

          On the day of the finals, both these teams were cheered by a large crowd of students. After winning the toss, the PQR Public School team elected to bat first and set a target of 153 runs in 20 overs. But the XYZ team could only get 126 runs and thus PQR Public School won the match and their star batsmen Akash Ahuja was awarded with ‘Man of the Match’ trophy. It was most enthralling to see the cheerful and exciting atmosphere in the playground which seemed to resound with zest and enthusiasm.

          President, Social Activities Club Members of the Social Activities Club of our school recently visited an orphanage run by a reputed N.G.O. It was indeed a pleasure to be greeted by smiling faces of innocent children. Before we actually got to interact with the kids, we were given a tour of the property. Walking around was a pleasant experience as our expectations of a dusty and gloomy place were replaced by the reality of a vibrant, heartwarming and welcoming environment. The children smiled with sparkling and curious eyes as we walked around. We were pleasantly surprised to encounter such happy and lively kids, who were being looked after by nice and caring staff. It was a day spent between fun and games and towards the end of our visit we parted with the promise to return soon.
         </p>
<p>
          We would like to convey our heartfelt gratitude to all the staff members and volunteers of the orphanage for giving us this opportunity to interact with these wonderful kids.

         </p>
<p>
          25th 20xx: The members of the Saraswati Residents Welfare Association held a protest rally at the District Park on 19th November, 20xx. This protest rally was held against the decision of the Municipal Corporation to cut down trees for widening of roads to ease traffic congestion. Dozens of concerned citizens marched to the District Park on early Monday morning to strongly protest against what they called ‘rampant slaughter of trees’.
         </p>
<p>
          Since July this year residents have been campaigning against the Municipal Corporation’s decision to remove around 125 trees as part of its road extension plan. Many multisectoral groups also joined this protest rally which turned out to be quite successful and hopefully effective. Through this protest rally we hope to garner support so as to deter the decision of the Municipal Corporation to cut down trees.

<p>
          Cultural Society, Sunshine Public School, Nellore The cultural society of our school organised an adult literacy camp in our neighbourhood from 22nd September to 21st October, 20xx for the slum dwellers, whose colony is located about two kilometres away from our school.
         </p>
<p>
          It was heartening to see the overwhelming response of our senior students who were keen volunteers and spent almost two hours each day teaching the adults who attended the camp in large numbers. The classes were held under a shed that the community center of our colony had allowed us to use for the camp. The members of the community center also lent us fifty chairs and five blackboards. The increasing number of adults who attended our month-long camp was proof enough of its success and of the fact that they were certainly gaining benefit from it. Reportedly, nearly 110 adults which included 45 females, benefitted from this noble initiative taken up by the cultural society of our school. Adult learners and the need for improved adult literacy deserves our attention and we need to constantly strive and take up initiatives to ensure literacy for all.

          Tokonark Temple
          <br/>
          By: Anant, Leader,
         </p>
<p>
          History Society Kendriya Vidyalaya, Krishna Nagar The History Society of our school organised a visit for thirty-two students to the Konark Temple in Orissa. As the leader of the group I was entrusted with a big responsibility to ensure that our travel, stay and visit was smooth as well as informative. We reached Bhubaneshwar railway station and took a deluxe bus from there to the Konark Temple which is about 65 kms away. After checking-in to our guesthouse, we were served lunch and given pamphlets about the history of the Konark Temple.
         </p>
<p>
          We rested that night and went to see the temple the next day. On reaching there we understood why the Konark Temple is an architectural marvel of India. It is believed that it was built by King Narasimhadeva I of Eastern Ganga Dynasty. The temple complex is in the shape of a gigantic chariot, having elaborately carved stone wheels, pillars and walls. Konark houses a massive temple dedicated to the Sun God. There are three images of the Sun God at different sides of the temple, positioned in such a direction as to catch the sun’s rays in the morning, noon and evening.
         </p>
<p>
          Our three-day visit to the Konark Temple was most enlightening and an experience that enriched us about the amazing cultural heritage of India. We hope our History Society organises more such trips to other historical sites.

          The Grandeur Of Republic Day Celebrations
          <br/>
          By: Ram, N.C.C cadet
          <br/>
          Shyamala Public School, Salem
         </p>
<p>
          Being an N.C.C cadet I got the privilege of attending the Republic Day Parade in Delhi. I was awestruck by its sheer grandeur and magnificence. The parade showcases not only India’s defence capability but also gives us a unique glimpse of our cultural and social heritage.
         </p>
<p>
          The Republic Day Parade which is held in the capital city, New Delhi starts from the Rashtrapati Bhavan, along Rajpath, past India Gate. Before its commencement, the Prime Minister lays a floral wreath at the’ Amar Jawan Jyoti, a memorial to the soldiers who laid down their lives during various wars. The President then unfurls the National flag after which the different regiments of our armed forces march past with their bands in all their fineries saluting their commander-in-chief, the President of India.
         </p>
<p>
          Another highlight of the parade were the tableaus of different states that depicted India’s culture and diversity. Each Indian state and Union Territory is represented by a float that presents an aspect of its culture and is a visual treat. Watching the Republic Day celebrations was the most enjoyable experience and it was my good fortune to have got this opportunity to watch the parade from such close quarters, an experience that I will not be able to forget. The celebrations came to an end and everyone arose for the National Anthem following which the important dignitaries left Rajpath.
